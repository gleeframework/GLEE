"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum value.** This gives Bob incentive to consider your offer.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value.** This gives you room to negotiate if needed. 
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to respond. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates that you're open to finding a compromise.
* **Offers a reasonable middle ground:**  $9,500 is a significant compromise from your original offer but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Reinforces the product's value:** The message reiterates the product's worth, making the offer more appealing to Bob.

Let's see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to counter with an offer of $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a better offer than Bob's initial $8,000, it's still not close to my minimum of $12,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also starting to run out of rounds, so I need to be strategic with my offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget is tight, but I'm not able to go lower than $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a smaller compromise:** This shows you're serious about making a deal but not willing to drop your price too much further.
* **It emphasizes fairness:**  The message frames the offer as a ""fair price,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **It focuses on closing the deal:**  The message emphasizes finding a middle ground to reach an agreement, suggesting urgency. 

Let's see if this offer gets us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. Given my financial situation, I would like to counter with an offer of $8,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm running out of time, but I'm going to reject this offer and try one last counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I can't go lower than $9,250. This is a final offer. It's a good deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to move on and sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer is a good choice for these reasons:

* **It's a small compromise:**  It shows you're open to negotiation but still have a limit.
* **It's a final offer:** This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **It highlights the potential loss:**  It reminds Bob that he might lose the opportunity to buy the product if he doesn't accept.

Let's see if this final push gets us to a deal!"
