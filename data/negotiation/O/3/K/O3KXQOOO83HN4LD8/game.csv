"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That reflects a willingness to compromise on both our parts.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, my final offer. This is a fair deal considering John is willing to sell at the same price. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
