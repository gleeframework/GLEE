Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
