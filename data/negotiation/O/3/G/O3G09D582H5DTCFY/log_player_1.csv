Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This is a unique item with the potential to be incredibly beneficial for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **50% Markup:** The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This signifies that you believe in the product's value and are aiming for a significant profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed in a way that invites discussion and potential negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he has some input in the process, increasing the chances of a deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make. Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the deal goes through."
