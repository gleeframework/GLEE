"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. While I think this product is valuable, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible while still staying within his budget. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's minimum, showing a willingness to negotiate, but also leaving room for a possible compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value of this product. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is a significant drop from her previous offer and is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then potentially asking for a higher price than $13,250 exists.  Accepting the offer at this point ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price, saving him $1,750 compared to buying from John."
