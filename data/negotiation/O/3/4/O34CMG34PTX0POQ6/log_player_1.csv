Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob's valuation is $1,000,000, we aim for a price that gives you a significant profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting that John is waiting in the wings creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,150,000, starting slightly higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
