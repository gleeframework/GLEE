Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the product's value and my financial situation, I would like to counter with a price of $950,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to our desired price range. Let's see if we can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a final offer of $960,000. This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 960000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. It's time to start nudging Bob more firmly towards a final decision.
* **Strong Position:** We're still well above John's fallback offer of $800,000. 
* **Finality:** By framing this as a ""final offer"" we're increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. He might be willing to accept to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your efforts in negotiating. I would like to counter with an offer of $940,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer at this point. Accepting the $940,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential lost opportunities with other buyers.  
* **Strong Offer:** $940,000 is a strong offer, exceeding your minimum acceptable price by a considerable margin."
