{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still remaining significantly above John's $800,000 offer.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically and the potential ROI helps justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing the sale to John."
