"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to negotiate as you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice is hoping to get at least $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000, and you are likely to get a better price than if you continue to counteroffer.  There is a good chance that Alice will not budge further, and you could risk losing the deal completely."
