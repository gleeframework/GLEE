Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,400,000 is lower than Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:**  This offer signals you're confident in the product's value but also open to negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. Keep in mind John's offer as a safety net, but aim for a price closer to Bob's estimated value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what you'd ideally like to get. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your desired price. By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer and try to close the gap between your desired price and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This offer is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Highlighting the value:** The message reiterates the value of the product, reminding Bob of its potential benefit to him.
* **Creating urgency:**  The message implies that you're open to negotiation, but there's a possibility of selling to John if an agreement isn't reached quickly."
