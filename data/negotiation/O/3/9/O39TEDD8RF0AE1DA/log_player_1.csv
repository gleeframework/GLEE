I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I can adjust the price down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,500 is too low for me, especially since the product is worth $8,000 to me. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I think this is a fair price that gives us both some room for negotiation."

Bob is now offering $7,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000.  This is the best option to ensure I get a decent return on the product."
