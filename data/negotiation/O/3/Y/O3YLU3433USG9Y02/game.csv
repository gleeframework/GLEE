"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm able to pay right now. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  $900000 is a bit lower than I can accept right now, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference and go with $1050000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the significant value this product brings to your business, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1025000. This would allow me to move forward with the sale, while still ensuring I receive a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can close the deal on this offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. While $1025000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm confident we can bridge the gap. I'd like to offer $1000000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase while ensuring I get a great deal on this valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer of $1000000.  While it's getting closer to what I need, it's still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1012500. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can finally close this! ",1012500.0,Alice,7,
