Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the concession, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
