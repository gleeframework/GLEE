"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits and my current financial constraints. I'm open to further negotiation, but this is my starting point.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000? I believe this price reflects the true value it would bring to your business while acknowledging your initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. To find a middle ground, I'm offering $1,450,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits of the product while respecting my financial limitations. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
