Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I know you're familiar with its potential and I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. This is a one-time opportunity, so I encourage you to seriously consider it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value gap:**  There's a $200,000 difference between what the product is worth to Bob and what it's worth to you.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a strong baseline.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Offering a price slightly lower than John's offer gives Bob a perceived benefit while still leaving you with a good profit.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, as he's getting a better deal than what he'd expect from a typical negotiation."
