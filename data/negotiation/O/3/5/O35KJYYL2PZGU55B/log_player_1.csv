I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum. This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while leaving space for a potential win-win situation with Bob."
