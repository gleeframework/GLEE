"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",9000.0,Alice,3,
