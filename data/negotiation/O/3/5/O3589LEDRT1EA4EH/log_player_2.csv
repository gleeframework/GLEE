"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to your budget. You can always buy from John for $8,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Target in Mind:** I'm aiming for a final price around $7,000, so starting at $6,000 gives us space to meet in the middle.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a polite and positive tone is important to encourage a good negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved towards my offer, $9,000 is still above my target price and what I can get it for from John. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** There are several rounds left, so it's worth seeing if I can get Alice closer to $7,000. 
* **Backup Option:** I can always fall back on buying from John at $8,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down to $9,000, and my previous offer was $6,000.  $7,500 represents a compromise by meeting directly in the middle.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still slightly above what I'm willing to pay John, leaving me a little room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The offer is straightforward and presented in a way that encourages Alice to see it as a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $8,500 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At My Limit:** Alice is now only willing to go down to $8,500. This is only $500 less than her previous offer and still more than John's price.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  I can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice.
* **No Guarantee of Further Compromise:** There's no guarantee Alice will come down further in price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the sure thing with John."
