"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway. How about we settle on $16,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14,500? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
