"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that work for you?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your target price is $650,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting us close. How about we split the difference and settle at $662,500? That seems fair to both of us.",662500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $662,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $675,000 and $662,500, which would be $668,750. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",668750.0,Alice,7,
