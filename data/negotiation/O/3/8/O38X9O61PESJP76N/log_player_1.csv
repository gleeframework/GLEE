{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth a million dollars. I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please decide quickly."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 allows for a significantly marked-up initial offer.
* **Anchoring:** The high price of $1,800,000 sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be much higher than $1,000,000.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might find the offer too high and reject it outright. However, with the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, Alice can afford to take this calculated risk for the chance of a significantly higher profit."
