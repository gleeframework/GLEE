"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1,600,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to find a point closer to my initial offer.

"Bob,  I understand your financial constraints, but $1,550,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $1,600,000. This offer still provides significant value for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable price.  Let's find common ground to make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
