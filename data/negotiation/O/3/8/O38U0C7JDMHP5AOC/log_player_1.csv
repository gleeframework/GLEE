"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is close to my minimum price of $12,000 but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It's a good starting point to see if he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $13,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate and potentially going back and forth several more rounds."
