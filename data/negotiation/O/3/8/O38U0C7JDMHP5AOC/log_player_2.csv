"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $13,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate while still being within Bob's budget. This is a reasonable counteroffer that gives Alice room to compromise without feeling pressured to accept immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation process going and may lead to a price closer to $13,500, which is Bob's target. Buying from John at $15,000 is still a worse option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price lower.  $13,750 is a midpoint between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer, which might be a good compromise point for both parties."
