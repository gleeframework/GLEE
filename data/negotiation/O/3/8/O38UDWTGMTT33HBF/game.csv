"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that work for you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and the time and effort I've invested in it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and $1,150,000, so I'll offer you $1,187,500. This is my final offer.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
