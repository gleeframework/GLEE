Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I value highly. Given its potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $950,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob.  He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price between $800,000 (his valuation) and $950,000. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as ""fair"" rather than a hard bargain, encouraging Bob to engage. 

By setting the initial price high but not unreasonable, I increase my chances of securing a deal with Bob that's more profitable than selling to John."
