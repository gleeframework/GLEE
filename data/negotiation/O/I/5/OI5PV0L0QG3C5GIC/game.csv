"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from it.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and $950,000 falls short of reflecting that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
