"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not exactly. I can do $1075000, which is a bit more than your middle ground, but still a compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I can do $1025000, which is still a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think we're getting close to the top of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1025000, which is $987500. Can you consider that price?",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can do $1020000, which is just a bit above the midpoint. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to know if you're serious about making a deal. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,7,
