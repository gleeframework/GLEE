Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in this opportunity.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $912,500. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to the value I see in this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another interested buyer, but $943,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer and is closer to the price I need to be able to move forward with this purchase.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price point significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll move substantially closer to my target in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,200,000 and avoids the risk of Bob's lowballing tactics."
