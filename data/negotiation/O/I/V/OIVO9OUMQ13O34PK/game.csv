"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I can accept. Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price and it works within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
