I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value ($10,000), giving me room to negotiate, but also not so high that it immediately turns Bob off. 

I'm looking forward to seeing how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is a decent price, but I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer, indicating I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to agree without me having to go too much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,500 is still a good deal for me, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure the sale now than to potentially end up with John's lower offer."
