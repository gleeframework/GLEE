Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it aligns with the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.
