"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still quite a bit above your target of $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you open the door for counteroffers and potentially a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** You haven't ruled out buying from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's, aiming to start the negotiation with a strong stance.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes your desire to close the deal while suggesting the price is fair considering your perceived value.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

* **Buying from John remains an option.** This decision keeps the door open to John's offer if Alice doesn't come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.

I'm very interested in closing this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** $825,000 is only $25,000 above your ideal price of $800,000.
* **Limited time:** You've already had 5 rounds, and it's important to make progress before you run out of time.
* **Risk of buying from John:** If you keep rejecting Alice's offers, you risk having to buy from John for a significantly higher price.  

While you could try to negotiate a bit more, accepting this offer is the safest choice to ensure you get the product within your budget and within the limited rounds."
