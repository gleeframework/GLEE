"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your initial offer.  I'm very interested in closing this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
