Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start with my minimum acceptable price, $120.  I know Bob values the product at $100, so this is a bit of a stretch, but I'm hoping to see if he's willing to pay a bit more. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a bit lower than I'd like, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  Since it's only one round, I'm willing to accept to avoid the risk of a counteroffer from Bob and ending up with nothing."
