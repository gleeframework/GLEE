"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $110 is a price Bob might be willing to consider, especially if he values the product at $80.
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to create a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Seeking better price:** I want to see if I can push Bob further and potentially get closer to my $100 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept.
* **Reiterating my minimum:**  $100 is my absolute minimum, and I'm confident that Bob will find it a reasonable price given his valuation of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While I'd prefer $100,  accepting this offer leaves room for future negotiations with Bob, potentially leading to even higher prices for future transactions.
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures a sale and eliminates the risk of having to sell to John for $100.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale at a price that is just below my ideal, but still within my acceptable range. This also allows me to maintain a good relationship with Bob for potential future transactions."
