"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,750 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a significant compromise for me.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd hate to lose this opportunity to work with you.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. If I don't hear back from you, I'll have to consider buying from a competitor, and I'd hate to do that. Can we meet in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,6,
