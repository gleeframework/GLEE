Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get for the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer one more time, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and I'm not willing to lower my price any further. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $10,000."
