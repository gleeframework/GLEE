This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, is priced at $950,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between its worth to you and my valuation of it, ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with John.** Even if you end up buying from John at $1,000,000, you're still within your budget. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to potentially finding a better deal, even if it means buying from John. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and potentially save money."
