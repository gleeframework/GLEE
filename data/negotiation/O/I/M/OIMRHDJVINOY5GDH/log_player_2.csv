"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
