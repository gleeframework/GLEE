"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to start the counter-offering process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for both of us, and it leaves some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to her.  This allows for a good starting point for negotiation, and signals to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm also leaving room for potential concessions, which could help us reach an agreement sooner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you while giving us both a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is good, but it's still too high for me at this point. I want to get the price down even further. I'll reject her offer and counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to a deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to reach a final agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further reduction from Alice's previous offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price as close to my ideal price as possible while still ensuring a reasonable offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,025,000? This is a reasonable compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to get it for my last price, I'm getting close to my limit for negotiation.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John, so I'll accept."
