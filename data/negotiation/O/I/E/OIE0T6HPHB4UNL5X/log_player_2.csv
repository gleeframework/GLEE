"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is clearly exaggerating the value of the product to you.  While $90 is less than John's price, there's a good chance you could get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or exploring other options."
