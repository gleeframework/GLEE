"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an incredible deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?
