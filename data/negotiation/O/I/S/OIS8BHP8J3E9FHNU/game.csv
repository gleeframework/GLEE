"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an incredible deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget limitations and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
