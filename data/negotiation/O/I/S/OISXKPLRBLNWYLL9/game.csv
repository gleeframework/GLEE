"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but the product is worth a lot to me, and $90 is a bit too low for me to part with it. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $95. That's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
