I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's very close to my minimum, I still believe there's a chance to get a slightly better price. I'm not yet at a point where I feel I need to settle for this amount, and I have two rounds remaining to continue negotiating."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a little more, I'm running out of time and Bob is not budging on his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
