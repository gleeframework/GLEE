"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $75 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $90, which would be $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",82.5,Alice,5,
