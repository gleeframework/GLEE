"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $145.** This is more than the product is worth to you ($150).
* **Buying from John for $150 is also more than the product is worth to you.** 
* **However, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or try to find a better deal elsewhere.**

By rejecting the offer, you maintain the opportunity to get a better price without committing to an overpriced purchase."
