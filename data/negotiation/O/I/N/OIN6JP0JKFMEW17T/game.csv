"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $162.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $162.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you at $147.50, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",147.5,Alice,5,
