"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about $87? That's closer to my budget and still leaves you a decent profit.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $92. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $89. I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable going all the way to $89, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I can offer it to you for $91. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. What do you think?",91.0,Alice,7,
