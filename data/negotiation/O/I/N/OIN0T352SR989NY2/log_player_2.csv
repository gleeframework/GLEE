"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the product for $125. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach an agreeable transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a decent price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100 for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $117.50 for the product? This is slightly above your offer but still reasonable considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.**  $117.50 is only $7.50 above your counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation is risky.** Pushing for a lower price risks Alice walking away or you ending up buying from John for a significantly higher price. 

It's a good compromise, and you're still getting the product for less than your initial limit."
