"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
