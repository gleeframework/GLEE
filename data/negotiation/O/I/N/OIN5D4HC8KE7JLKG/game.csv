"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is still a little out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $9500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Let's compromise at $9750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $9875. This is a good deal for both of us and I'm ready to finalize the sale.",9875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my limit, but I can only go up to $9800.  I hope you can see that this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",9800.0,Bob,8,
