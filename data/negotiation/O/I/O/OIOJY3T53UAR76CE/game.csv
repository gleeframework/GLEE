"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to the product's value as possible.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1050000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant investment for me. If this price doesn't work for you, I'm open to discussing other options, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
