"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. I understand you may not be familiar with its full potential, but I am confident it could be highly beneficial for your business.  While I'm not at liberty to disclose specifics at this time, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This represents a substantial opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a potentially advantageous price.  Please consider my offer carefully.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, that doesn't guarantee it holds the same value for you. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for a lower price."
