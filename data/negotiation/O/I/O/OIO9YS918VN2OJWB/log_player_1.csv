Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. I believe this offer is attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I am willing to negotiate further but I will not accept a price below my minimum. I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for further negotiation.  This compromise acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum, and it's a quicker and more reliable outcome."
