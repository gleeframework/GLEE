"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given that's my max budget. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $115?  I'm really hoping to get this product to a good home, and I think this price is fair.",115.0,Alice,5,
