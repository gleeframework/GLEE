"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  However, I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000, so I'm only open to this price for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $150,000."
