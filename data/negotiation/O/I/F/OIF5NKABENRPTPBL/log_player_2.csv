"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a special price. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let's discuss a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($12,000). 
* Accepting the offer means you save $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you might prefer a lower price, it's still a good deal for you, and you're getting the product."
