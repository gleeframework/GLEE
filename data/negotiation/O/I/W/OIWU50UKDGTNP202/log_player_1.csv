Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this value."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes a perceived higher value for the product. 
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
