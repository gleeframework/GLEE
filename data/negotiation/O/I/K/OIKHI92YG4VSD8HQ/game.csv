"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,300,000 is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $600,000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I understand you see value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price reflects a considerable reduction on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on.  To be honest,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
