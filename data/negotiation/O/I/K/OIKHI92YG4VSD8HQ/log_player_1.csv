Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing what might work best for both of us."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,300,000 is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $600,000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I understand you see value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price reflects a considerable reduction on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on.  To be honest,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a higher price, accepting $850,000 is a substantial gain over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate has risks: Bob might lower his offer, and there's no guarantee I can get closer to $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds."
