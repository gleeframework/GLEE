"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of your product, $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my price range. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $18000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $15000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking that the product's value is worth a bit more to you than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",16000.0,Alice,5,,
