Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is still well above your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
