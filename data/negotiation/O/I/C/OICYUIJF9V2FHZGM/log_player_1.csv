Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have a single chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but not so high that Bob walks away. A price close to his valuation makes it more tempting for him to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 gain over your fallback offer and gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his valuation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and ""return on investment"" subtly emphasizes why the price is justified.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  This phrasing adds a sense of scarcity and might make the offer more enticing. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could experiment with slightly different prices (e.g., $1,125,000 or $1,175,000) to see how they impact the negotiation outcome."
