"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first. There's a chance you can get the price lower than $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price is still fair, considering the product's value and my potential deal with John. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,350,000 is closer to your goal, you're still above your limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still slightly below what I need to accept.  I'm prepared to come down to $1325000 as a final compromise. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget.  Since you're nearing your limit of rounds and have a guaranteed deal with John, it's best to secure the product from John for $1,200,000."
