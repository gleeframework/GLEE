"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we settle at $16,500? This price reflects the true value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $15,750. Can we compromise on this price?",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,750 is close, but I need to be closer to $16,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're close to your desired price, but I'm still not willing to go up to $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $15,500. Can we compromise on this price?",15500.0,Bob,6,
