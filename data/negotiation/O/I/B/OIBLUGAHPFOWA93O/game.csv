"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115? It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get a fair price for my product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $110. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $110 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $105 again? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you.",105.0,Bob,6,
