Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He might be willing to pay a premium over his perceived value ($80) to get a ""good deal.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, ensuring I still get a price above my minimum."
