"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's significantly more than Bob's perceived value. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price, the amount John is willing to pay. This demonstrates my commitment to earning at least my minimum while giving Bob a realistic price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still being above Bob's last offer, hopefully encouraging him to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is inching closer, I'm still not happy with it. There are still some rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still staying above Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is close to my target, I'm not willing to settle just yet. With only two rounds left, I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,025,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal but also that I won't settle for much less than my goal. With only one round left, I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
