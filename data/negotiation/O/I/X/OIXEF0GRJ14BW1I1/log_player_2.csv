# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're extending this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $100. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope you'll consider taking advantage of it. Thank you for considering our product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you could get a better price.  You can try negotiating with Alice or see if she lowers the price in a subsequent offer. You can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
