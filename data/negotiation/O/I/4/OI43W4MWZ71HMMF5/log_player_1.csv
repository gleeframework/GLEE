I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $135.  This is a compromise, still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob."
