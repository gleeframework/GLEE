"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly. I also want to keep in mind the potential deal with John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's far below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  $1,200,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price considering his initial offer of $800,000. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can reach a price that's closer to my ideal target. Selling to John is still an option, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my offer of $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully, Bob will find it reasonable considering his previous offer of $950,000.  I'm feeling optimistic that we can close a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky one. Bob has reached my minimum value, and while I'd love to get more, it's getting late in the game.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John would be a safe bet, but I'm going to take the deal with Bob.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the future, and this is a good starting point."
