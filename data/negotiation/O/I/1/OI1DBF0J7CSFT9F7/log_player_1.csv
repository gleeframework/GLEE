"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to build a positive relationship with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's value without revealing too much information about my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm clearly open to negotiation by stating I'm ""willing to offer it to you."" 
* **Actionable Next Step:**  I give Bob a clear action to take â€“ respond with his thoughts. 

This approach sets the stage for a negotiation where I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Even though I'm willing to sell for $8,000, there's a chance I can get a better deal with Bob. He expressed interest, so there's room for compromise.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more.  
* **Preserving Leverage:** Accepting his offer immediately closes the deal, but I want to see if I can push for a higher price before potentially selling to John.

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $8,000 is a good starting point, I need to consider my costs.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to continue offering you this great product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. This subtly implies that $9,000 is still a good deal.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the offer for both parties. This positions the offer as a win-win scenario.
* **Actionable Next Step:** I give Bob a clear next step to consider my counteroffer. 

By proposing a slightly higher price and focusing on fairness, I'm aiming to secure a more favorable deal while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will either walk away or continue to lowball me.  
* **Time is Money:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be pragmatic and secure a deal that's close to my target. 

While I'd love to push for a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out entirely.  This is a solid deal, and it's time to close it."
