Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than the product's value to Bob but still leaves me a significant profit margin. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I'm not undervaluing the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the same as John's, it's still worth exploring further negotiation. There's a chance to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still maintaining a healthy profit margin. This signals my willingness to negotiate while not giving away too much. I believe this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to consider while still being beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $8,000, and it's also higher than John's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering the limited time. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing."
