Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
