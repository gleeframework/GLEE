Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $14,000.  I believe it will be very beneficial to you and this price reflects its value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While a higher offer might be tempting, there's a risk Bob will reject it. This offer is high enough to be profitable but low enough to increase the chances of acceptance.  
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. It means Alice doesn't have to accept an offer below that."
