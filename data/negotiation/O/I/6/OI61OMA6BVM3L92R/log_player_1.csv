I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point, and it's above my minimum of $8,000.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping it's a good compromise for Bob."
