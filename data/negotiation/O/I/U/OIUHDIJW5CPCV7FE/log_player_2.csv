Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. While $1,100,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's final offer:** Alice is firm at $1,050,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but not budge much further.
* **John's price:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is a better price. However, there's no guarantee that negotiating with Alice will lead to a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a counteroffer might be possible, it's a gamble.  Alice may be unwilling to negotiate further, and the risk of losing the product altogether is high. 

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer."
