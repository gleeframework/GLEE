"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects my budget and your need to sell.  Let's work together to find a solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
