"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal than $950,000, especially since you have a backup option of buying from John for $800,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

You should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The goal is to get as close to your target price of $800,000 as possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You're only $90,000 above your target price and it's likely you won't be able to get much lower with further negotiation.  It's a reasonable compromise, especially considering your alternative is to buy from John for $800,000."
