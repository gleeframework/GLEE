"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to build a good rapport.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $1,500 difference gives Bob enough room to counteroffer, but it's still a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,800 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I still have 8 rounds left and can counteroffer. There's a good chance Bob will be willing to pay more to get the product.
* **Not rushing into a bad deal:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,800 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,150? This still leaves you a good deal, and I'd be happy to close the deal with you at that price."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to compromise by meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Emphasize value again:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $11,150, he's still getting a good deal.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to avoid escalating the negotiation. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** There's still room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm moving closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, so please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $10,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited rounds:** While I have 6 rounds left, I don't want to waste too many rounds with Bob if he's unwilling to budge significantly.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John for $12,000 is still a good option, and I'm not feeling pressured to accept a lower price just yet. 
* **Potential for better offer:**  I'm still holding out hope that Bob might increase his offer slightly in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,900 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to close the deal.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by coming down to $11,000. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate while staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing this price as fair for both of us, which might make Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Direct and clear:**  I'm being direct and clear in my communication, leaving no room for misunderstanding.
* **Remaining options:** I'm still open to further negotiation if needed, but I'm getting closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're down to 4 rounds left, and Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of reaching a stalemate or a lower price than I'd like.

While I'm always open to negotiation, at this point,  John's offer provides a more secure outcome and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better deal."
