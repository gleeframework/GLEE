"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,800 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,150? This still leaves you a good deal, and I'd be happy to close the deal with you at that price.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,900 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to close the deal.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
