"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for me to come down in price if necessary. I'm also considering John's offer of $1,000,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm also considering John's offer as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price that is closer to my valuation. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm also aware that time is ticking away. I might need to seriously consider selling to John if I don't see a significant improvement in Bob's offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm reducing my price again to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still hoping to get a price that's closer to my valuation. With only 5 rounds left, I'm getting a bit more serious about closing the deal with Bob. However, I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before seriously considering John's offer.  I'm confident I can get a better price with one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,025,000.  This is a small concession, but it shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal. With only 3 rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept.  If it doesn't, I'm going to have to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better offer from Bob. While $990,000 is closer to my valuation, it's still less than what John is offering. I'm going to take the safe route and sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking getting a lower offer from Bob."
