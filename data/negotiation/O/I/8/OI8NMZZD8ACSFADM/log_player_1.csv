Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This offer reflects my understanding of the product's worth and its potential impact on your operations."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation offers the potential for a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** By positioning this as a special offer for Bob, it might make him more inclined to accept, as opposed to presenting it as a mere negotiation."
