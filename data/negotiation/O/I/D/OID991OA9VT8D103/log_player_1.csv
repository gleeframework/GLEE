Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point - it's above what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also confident that I can get at least $120 from John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $100. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price of $120. It's time to move on and secure the best possible outcome."
