Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This initial offer provides room for me to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring I get a good price.
* **John as leverage:** Knowing I have John willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's willing to negotiate, indicating a potential for a better price.
* **Leveraging John:**  I can leverage John's offer of $15,000 as a bargaining chip to push Bob towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still well above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a good starting point for a compromise, being a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's perceived value, giving me leverage to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is still too low for me.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely take more time, and I'm not confident of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a better outcome than continuing with a potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
