"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for his maximum price of $10,000. This counteroffer establishes his limit, and leaves room for some potential negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer of $12,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his limit. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price. It's worth noting that if Bob rejects this offer, he can always buy from John for $10,000, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already established his maximum price of $10,000, but Alice seems willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a better price.  It's a compromise that might be more attractive to Alice than his previous offer."
