"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows for a significant profit for you.  Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $875,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
