{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to the value you placed on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a good deal for me.  It's better to secure a sale than risk losing Bob and having to settle with John for $80."
