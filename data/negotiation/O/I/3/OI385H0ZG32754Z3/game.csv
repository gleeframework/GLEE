"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $155? This would be a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $150, which is a fair price for both of us and would allow me to finalize the purchase.  What do you think?",150.0,Bob,4,
