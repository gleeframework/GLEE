"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. My initial offer is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $850,000 to make it work. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price if we keep talking."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. He's likely to be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm very serious about buying this product, but I need to be closer to $900,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down closer to Bob's desired price, $920,000 is still more than he wants to pay. Bob has 5 more rounds to negotiate and can likely still get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is my final offer for now. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $920,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which would normally cost $20,000. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some added value. I'm sticking with my price of $920,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the extras are tempting, Bob is still focused on getting the best possible price. The warranty and maintenance package are valuable, but they don't make up for the difference between $920,000 and his ideal price. He still has 3 rounds to negotiate, and he might be able to get a lower price or a more significant package of extras."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added extras, and they are definitely valuable. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000. If you can come down to $905,000, I'd be happy to accept. This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 905000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already given you a lot of value with the added extras. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $905,000 and $920,000, which is $912,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that's just slightly above Bob's desired range. He only has one round left to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice won't budge further. Buying from John would cost significantly more. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
