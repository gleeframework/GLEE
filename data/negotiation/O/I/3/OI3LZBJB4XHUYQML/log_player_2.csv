I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to my maximum budget of $100. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer and highlighting the compromise I'm making.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale."
