"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $120? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $95, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a price that feels more comfortable for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $95, which is $107.50. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my absolute limit for this product.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
