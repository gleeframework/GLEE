"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,200. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
