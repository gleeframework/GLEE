"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $85 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $82.50?  I'm sure we can finalize this quickly.",82.5,Bob,4,
