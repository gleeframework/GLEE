"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This is a bold opening strategy that sets a strong starting point for the negotiation. It's likely Bob will reject this offer, giving me the opportunity to see if he's truly interested and where his counteroffer falls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, aiming for a higher price. There's still potential to reach a deal that's more profitable for me, and selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong stance on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while it's tempting to take the $1,100,000, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push him closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains my fallback option, but I'm not giving up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a further concession, but I believe it's still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable price and the potential for John to offer me $1,500,000. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet me in the middle.  I've reached the point where my time and effort are better spent elsewhere.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to accept an offer far below my minimum.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further negotiation headaches."
