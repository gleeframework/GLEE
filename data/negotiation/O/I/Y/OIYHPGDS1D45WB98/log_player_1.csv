Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price might result in a faster sale and still net a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $90 is a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving me room to negotiate if needed. It also allows me to potentially secure a higher profit margin than selling to John. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 
 
Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
