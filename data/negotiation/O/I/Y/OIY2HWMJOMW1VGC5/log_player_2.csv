"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially leading to a compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Bob should continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price. He has plenty of rounds left and can always choose to buy from John if he's not satisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still a good deal for Bob and could potentially be accepted by Alice, especially if she is willing to make concessions to close the deal. This offer also keeps Bob's maximum price in mind, ensuring he doesn't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,900 is closer to Bob's ideal price, Bob can still aim for a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get the product for even less.  He has several rounds left, and the risk of buying from John for $8,000 is still an option if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now within $100 of his ideal price from John. He's showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his maximum. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and might lead to a final agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  While it would be ideal to get the product for $8,000, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for the same price is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product and only pays $800 more than his absolute limit.  The remaining rounds offer little chance for significant price reduction, and Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate."
