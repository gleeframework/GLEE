Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for Value:** The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message directly asks Bob for a decision, prompting a response.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he might not be willing to pay the full price. He might try to negotiate or walk away if the price is too high.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
