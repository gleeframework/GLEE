"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, you can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  You know John is willing to sell for $10,000, so you have a benchmark to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above John's price of $10,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while still keeping my goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $10,800 is a good deal. It's only $800 more than John's price, and it saves me the hassle of further negotiation.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might become stubborn and refuse to budge, forcing me to buy from John anyway. Accepting this offer gives me a slight saving and avoids that risk."
