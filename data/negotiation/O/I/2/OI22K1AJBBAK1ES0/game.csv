"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you and gives me a fair return.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still not at a point where I can make the sale.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise and will ensure we both get a good deal.  Let's work together to close this.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,100, which is a fair compromise.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal.",9100.0,Alice,7,
