I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals that I'm willing to negotiate."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm going to reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility while still remaining within my budget. I've also made it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and although she's claimed it's her final offer, I'm unsure if I can get her to go lower.  At this point, I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget and a better deal than what Alice is offering."
