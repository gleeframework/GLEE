"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
