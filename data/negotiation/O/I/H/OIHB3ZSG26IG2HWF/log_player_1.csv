"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe it would benefit both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can push for a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However, $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.
