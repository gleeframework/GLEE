"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It shows I'm interested but also signals that I'm looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to your price range, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try countering again to see if you can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?"",
""product_price"": 107.50
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to meet Alice halfway while still securing a significant discount. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $110 represents a good compromise. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the opportunity."
