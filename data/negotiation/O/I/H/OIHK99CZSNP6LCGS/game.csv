"Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
