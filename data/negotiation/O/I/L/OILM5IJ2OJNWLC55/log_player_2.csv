# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still above his budget. He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for it. This is my best offer, considering my budget constraints. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already indicated he's willing to pay $9,000, and Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. There's still room for them to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm closer to your price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to accept, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to pay $9,500, and Alice has lowered her price from $10,500.  There's still room for them to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go above $9,500. It's a significant amount for me, and I'm not sure I can justify going higher.  Perhaps we can split the difference?  I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,875. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He has already shown a willingness to pay $9,750, and Alice has only moved down to $9,875.  This suggests they may not be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and Bob could end up paying more than he wants.  It's better to go with John, who is offering the product for his maximum budget of $8,000."
