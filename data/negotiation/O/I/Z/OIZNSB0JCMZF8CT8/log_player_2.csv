# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe could be a valuable asset to you.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, but I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant savings for you compared to what you would otherwise need to invest to develop a similar product.  I believe this offer is fair and mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
