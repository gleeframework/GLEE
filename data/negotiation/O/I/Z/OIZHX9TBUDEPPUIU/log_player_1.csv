{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is close to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I make it clear I'm open to discussion and counteroffers.

This strategy aims to:

* Secure a good price while leaving space for Bob to negotiate.
*  Avoid a quick rejection by John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000, but not more.

Remember, this is just a starting point. I'll analyze Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), it's significantly lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **No immediate pressure:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm not in a rush. I'll continue the negotiation with Bob to see if I can achieve a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer ($1,400,000) while considering Bob's willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  I propose a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000).
* **Reinforcing value:**  I remind Bob that this is still a great deal for him, highlighting the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that satisfies both of us. By showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, I hope to reach an agreement that's beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my ideal outcome, it's still not high enough. I believe I can push for a better price.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Room for a counteroffer:**  There's still space to negotiate, and I can counteroffer with a slightly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $1,250,000. My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, but closer to my initial desired outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we settle at $1,275,000?  This is only a small increase from your offer and it would allow me to get a better deal for my product.  I'm confident this price is still very fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $25,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a more favorable outcome.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that the price is still fair for Bob, even with a slight increase.
* **Reaching a compromise:**  This offer demonstrates a willingness to find a middle ground, but it's not giving in completely.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to find a price that is just within Bob's acceptable range, but closer to my desired outcome. By being persistent but reasonable, I hope to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1275000. I'm willing to pay $1225000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is getting tough:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous counteroffer, and the negotiation is becoming more challenging.
* **Reaching a decision point:**  I need to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Close to desired outcome:** While not ideal, $1,225,000 is still a good price, and it's within a reasonable range of my desired outcome. 

**Risks and Considerations:**

* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I continue to counteroffer, there's a chance that Bob will become frustrated and decide to stop negotiating.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Further negotiation could take time, and I might be missing out on other potential buyers.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice.  While not my ideal price, it's a solid deal that secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation complications."
