"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $1250000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about we settle at $1275000?  This is only a small increase from your offer and it would allow me to get a better deal for my product.  I'm confident this price is still very fair for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
