Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Alice wants to see if she can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product for slightly less than John's price ($950,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can still potentially secure a price higher than $1,000,000 or accept his counter if it's close enough. 
* **Confidence:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value,"" Alice reinforces the perception that the product is worth a premium price."
