I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, and I'm willing to risk a bit to see if I can get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than what I can get from John.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer but shows my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than what John is offering. I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation with Bob to see if I can get a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $15,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer and closer to what I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $15,000, it seems like Bob is not willing to go higher. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I will sell the product to John."
