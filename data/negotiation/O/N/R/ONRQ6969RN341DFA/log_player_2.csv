"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a price from which we can both benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you open up the possibility of:

* **Alice making a counter-offer:** She might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale, especially knowing you have an alternative option.
* **Sticking with John:**  While John's price is your absolute maximum, it acts as a safety net. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from him."
