Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a price from which we can both benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, Bob's higher valuation ($1,500,000) presents an opportunity to earn significantly more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. This price point also offers Bob a potential $100,000 gain, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Confident Approach:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as mutually beneficial, increasing the likelihood of Bob's acceptance."
