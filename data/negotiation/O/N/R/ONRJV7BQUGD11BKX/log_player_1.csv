{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price to give Bob some room to negotiate. I'm also expressing confidence in the value of the product to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
