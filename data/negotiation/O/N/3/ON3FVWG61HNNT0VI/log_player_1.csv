Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John.

**Strategy**

You have leverage because you know Bob values the product more than your minimum. Your goal is to find a price that earns you the most profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit ($150,000 above your minimum) and still saves Bob $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Confidence:** The message exudes confidence, implying that this is a fair and well-considered offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $1,175,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer could be beneficial in the long run.
