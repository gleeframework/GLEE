"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
