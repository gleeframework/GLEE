Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
