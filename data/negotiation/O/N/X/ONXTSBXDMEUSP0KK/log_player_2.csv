{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $7,000 is a decent price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my target price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $6,900. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's likely close to her bottom line.  $6,900 is a good price, and continuing to push might make her less willing to negotiate.  I'll accept the offer."
