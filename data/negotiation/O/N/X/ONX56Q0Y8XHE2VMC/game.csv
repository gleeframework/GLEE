"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $9,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not able to meet at $9,000. Could we possibly agree on $8,800? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal on the product.",8800.0,Bob,4,
