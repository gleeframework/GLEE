"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than the $1,000,000 John is willing to sell it for. Your goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves the best price."
