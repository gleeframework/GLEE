"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit, so starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) is strategic.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value, setting a confident tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I can go up to $920,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is significantly higher than our fallback option ($800,000 from John), it's still substantially below Bob's perceived value and our initial offer.  We have room to negotiate and are aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,010,000? This recognizes the value it holds for you while being fair to my position."", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise by moving closer to Bob's last offer while still staying significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  We're justifying the price by highlighting the shared benefit of the deal (meeting in the middle).
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We're continuing to use positive language and focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that price. I can go up to $980,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 is still below our target.  We'll continue negotiating strategically to see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal.  It seems we're getting close. How about we land at $1,000,000 even?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the significant value this product brings you."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We're getting closer to a potentially agreeable price point, and Bob's incremental increases show he's willing to pay a significant amount.
* **Clean Number:** Offering an even $1,000,000 creates a psychological anchor and may make the deal feel more appealing.
* **Finality:**  The language suggests this is a final offer to encourage Bob to accept and bring the negotiation to a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I can go up to $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's increases are getting smaller.  While we could likely negotiate him up a bit more, it might not be a significant increase.
* **Time Value:** We've spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures a very good price ($960,000) and avoids the risk of Bob stalling or the negotiation failing. 
* **Strong Profit:**  $960,000 is significantly higher than our fallback option ($800,000 from John). 

It's a good business decision to accept a strong offer on the table rather than risk losing the deal by pushing for an incrementally better outcome."
