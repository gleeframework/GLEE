"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something that's truly valuable to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its worth to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're looking for.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I can see that you're willing to negotiate, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
