"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $150? That's the maximum I can afford, and I'm hoping you can work with me on this.",150.0,Bob,4,
