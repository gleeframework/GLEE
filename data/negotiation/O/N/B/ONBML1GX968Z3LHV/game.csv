"I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a good profit while still offering you a competitive price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,375? I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. ",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I'm willing to make one more offer: $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Bob,6,
