"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within budget, Bob, but I have to consider my costs as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we settle on $12,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still just a bit over my comfort zone. Let's try $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures we both walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,4,
