"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $145, which is closer to my limit and a fairer price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",145.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $152. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",152.0,Alice,5,
