Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and see if we can find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop my price that much. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. How about that?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $140. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. Is that a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still below my minimum, it's close enough to my goal of maximizing profit.  It's also likely that Bob won't go any higher, and if I reject, I might have to settle for selling to John at $150.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
