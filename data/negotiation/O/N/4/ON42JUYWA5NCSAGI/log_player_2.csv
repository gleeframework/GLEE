"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing.  $500,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get a better deal.  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, aiming to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to budge. By offering a price considerably lower than her initial offer, Bob aims to encourage further negotiation while still showing he is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite far from the $300,000 counteroffer. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his last offer. Rejecting and making another counteroffer will further test Alice's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise while still maintaining his negotiation stance.  This middle ground counteroffer  might be more appealing to Alice, increasing the chance of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it seems Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  $450,000 is a good deal for Bob, saving him $550,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might result in further price reductions, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob missing out on a good deal is high.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase while maximizing savings."
