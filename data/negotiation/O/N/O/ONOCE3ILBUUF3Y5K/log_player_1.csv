Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. It's in great condition and I believe it's a steal at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept the offer outright if he's particularly interested.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we want to maximize profit, pricing it too high ($200 or more) might make Bob immediately reject the offer. By offering it at $175, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, or accept the price to avoid missing out.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's less risk in aiming a bit higher with Bob."
