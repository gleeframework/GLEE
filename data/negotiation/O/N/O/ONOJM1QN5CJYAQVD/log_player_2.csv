"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  $1,000,000 is still above Alice's value of $800,000, so there is room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,050,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob wants to pay. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,025,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than the $1,200,000 he would pay John. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away and he'll be forced to buy from John."
