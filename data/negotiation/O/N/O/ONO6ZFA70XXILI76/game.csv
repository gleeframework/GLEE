"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort towards a compromise. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000.
