"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we discuss a price closer to $900,000? I'm looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This allows you to get a great product at a competitive price, and it gives me a better return on my investment.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm always open to finding common ground. However, $850,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $925,000. This still provides you with a great product at a competitive price, while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
