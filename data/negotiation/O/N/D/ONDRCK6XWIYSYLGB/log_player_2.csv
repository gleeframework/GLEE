Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I need you to understand that this product holds significant value, and I have other interested buyers. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I need a decision from you on this.

}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her price is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  She's also applied pressure with the ""final offer"" tactic. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're willing to pay within the remaining rounds.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
