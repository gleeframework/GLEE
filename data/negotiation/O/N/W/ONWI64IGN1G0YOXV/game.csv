"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and our shared desire to reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,575,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this now.",1575000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I see your offer as a step in the right direction, $1,575,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,525,000 for the product, which is very close to my limit. I'm confident that with a bit more flexibility, we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
