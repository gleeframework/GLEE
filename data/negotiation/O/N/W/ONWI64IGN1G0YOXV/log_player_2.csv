"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and our shared desire to reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower Starting Point:**  Bob is starting his counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, creating a clear negotiation space.
* **Fairness Argument:** Bob emphasizes the value of the product to him and uses ""fair price"" language to make his counteroffer feel reasonable.
* **Shared Desire:**  Bob subtly hints at wanting a deal, hoping to encourage Alice to see a negotiation as beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,575,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a lower price by continuing to counteroffer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be a guaranteed deal. However, Bob might still be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  

**Next Steps:** Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to bring the price down to $1,500,000 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I see your offer as a step in the right direction, $1,575,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,525,000 for the product, which is very close to my limit. I'm confident that with a bit more flexibility, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Change:**  Bob is making a smaller counteroffer than before, suggesting he's getting closer to his limit while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence in Agreement:** Bob expresses confidence that they can reach an agreement, hoping to encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Emphasis on Limit:** Bob reinforces his budget constraints, subtly pressuring Alice to lower her price."
