# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, given its value to me.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,525,000 is a good price, and it's close enough to my minimum that it's worth closing the deal now.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
