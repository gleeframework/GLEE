"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to buy the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12,500.  Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by acknowledging Alice's offer, but emphasizes his desire for a lower price. He uses $12,500 as a starting point, which is halfway between Alice's minimum and Bob's maximum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob is still in a good position to negotiate further, as he has a clear budget and Alice is demonstrating flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,250 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about we settle at $13,000? This would allow us both to come away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again acknowledging Alice's offer and her willingness to negotiate, but he's still aiming for a lower price. He's suggesting a price that's just a bit lower than Alice's offer, showing that he's willing to meet her halfway while still pursuing a more favorable price.  This also signals to Alice that he's serious about closing the deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
