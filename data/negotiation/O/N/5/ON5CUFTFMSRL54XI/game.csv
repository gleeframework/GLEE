"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $18,000 is lower than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $19,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $19,000, so I'm offering $18,500. I think that's a fair price for the product.",18500.0,Bob,4,
