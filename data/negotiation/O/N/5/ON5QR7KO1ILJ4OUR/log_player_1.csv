Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures you're making a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters, while still exceeding your minimum. 

By offering $130, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he counters, you can decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $100 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $115?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount of money by selling it to Bob at that price. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is much more in line with my desired profit. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
