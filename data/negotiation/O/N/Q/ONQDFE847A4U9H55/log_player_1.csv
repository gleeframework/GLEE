"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is far too low.  While selling to John is an option, it's best to continue negotiating with Bob for now as he's clearly interested and willing to pay a significant sum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While closer, $1,100,000 is still cutting it close to John's offer.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate towards a higher price, so it's worth one more counter-offer before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
