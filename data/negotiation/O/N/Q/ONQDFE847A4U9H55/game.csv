"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
