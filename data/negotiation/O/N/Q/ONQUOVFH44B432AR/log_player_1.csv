Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  You've set a minimum of $1,200,000, so this offer is still profitable for you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You haven't gone all-in with your maximum asking price, leaving space to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  By offering a price that's still attractive to Bob, you demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but also value your product. 

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You've already established a baseline with your initial offer of $1,400,000. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range. 

You have a few options for your counteroffer in the next round:

* **Counter with a price slightly lower than your initial offer:**  For example, $1,350,000. This demonstrates you're willing to compromise but still hold value in your product.
* **Counter with a price closer to your initial offer:** This is riskier, but if you believe Bob is genuinely interested, you could counter with $1,375,000 or $1,380,000. 

Remember, the key is to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a price that is both acceptable to him and profitable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise from your initial asking price. It's a reasonable middle ground that might be attractive to Bob.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,350,000 is still a significant amount of money and reflects the value of the product. This demonstrates you're not simply giving in to Bob's lowball offer.
* **Open Dialogue:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, keeping the negotiation open and amicable.

This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged while still pushing for a price that is closer to your ideal.  Keep in mind, the success of this counteroffer depends on Bob's willingness to negotiate and his perceived value of the product."
