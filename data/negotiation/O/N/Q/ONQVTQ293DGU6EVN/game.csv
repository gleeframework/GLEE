"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",107.0,Alice,3,
