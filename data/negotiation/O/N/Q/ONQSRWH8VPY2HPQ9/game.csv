"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? It's a significant saving for me and still a decent profit for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This still allows for a fair profit for me and a substantial saving for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $7,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $8,250. This is a small compromise for me, and it gives you a great price for a valuable product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
