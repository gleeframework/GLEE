"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $15,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. ",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we meet at $14,250? It's a fair price that's closer to my value.  Let's get this done!",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference again - I'm offering $14,125.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this round.",14125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, and that's my final offer. I really need to make a decision on this product, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",13750.0,Bob,8,
