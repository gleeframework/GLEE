"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has room to negotiate. He values the product at $1,000,000 and Alice is willing to sell for less than that. There's a range where both parties can benefit.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,000,000 gives Bob a strong bargaining position. He can use this information to try and get a lower price from Alice.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better price, potentially saving himself money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm hoping to secure a better price. Given its value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'd like to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach a beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob could continue negotiating, Alice has moved closer to his desired price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. 

* **Value vs. Risk:**  The difference between Alice's offer ($875,000) and Bob's ideal price ($850,000) is relatively small.  He's likely to save more by accepting than by risking Alice walking away or going to John for the full $1,000,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiation can be time-consuming and potentially stressful. Accepting at this point saves Bob both.

It's a calculated decision. While he could try to squeeze out another $25,000, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice given the information available."
