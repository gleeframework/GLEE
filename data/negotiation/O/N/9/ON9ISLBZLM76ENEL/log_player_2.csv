You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's closer than before, Bob still has the option to get the product from John for a lower price.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially lead to a better deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. Bob can save $250,000 by buying from John.  There's a chance that Alice might get closer to Bob's desired price with another counteroffer, but the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and while it's closer than before, Bob is now on his fifth round of counteroffers. It's likely Alice won't budge much further, and the risk of additional rounds is high.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price, which is a safer and more certain outcome."
