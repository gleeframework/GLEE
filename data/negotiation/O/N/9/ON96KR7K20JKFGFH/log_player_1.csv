Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price is still above what I could get from another seller, so it reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the unique advantages it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  To show my continued interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while remaining within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear his maximum price is unlikely to reach a point where it's significantly more beneficial than selling to John. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the most logical choice at this stage."
