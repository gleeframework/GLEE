"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,000,000 to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,3,
