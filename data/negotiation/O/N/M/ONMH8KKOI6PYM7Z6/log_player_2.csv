"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.
* Alice's offer is $900,000, which is within your budget.
* However, since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm offering $850,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $900,000.
* This price is still higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000, giving her some incentive to accept.
* This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation while still keeping the price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good price for me. 
* It is within my budget and still leaves some room for profit. 
* Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers and I will have to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
