"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very generous, however it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to me is significantly higher than that.  I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I acknowledge its worth, $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
