"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Bob,4,
