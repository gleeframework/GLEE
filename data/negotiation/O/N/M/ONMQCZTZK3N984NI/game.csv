"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000 for the product. This price still reflects its high value but provides a middle ground between our initial positions. I hope this proposal will be more in line with your budget while still allowing us to reach a satisfactory agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This offer demonstrates my commitment to working with you, while staying within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
