"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't agree to $115. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? That would be more within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  That would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet you halfway at $105. Could you consider lowering the price further to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
