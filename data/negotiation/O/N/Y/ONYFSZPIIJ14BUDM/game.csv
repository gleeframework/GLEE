"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500, which would be $10,000. This is a fair price for the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
