Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get more. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a decent compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $2,000,000, accepting his offer at $1,750,000 is a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000. The risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
