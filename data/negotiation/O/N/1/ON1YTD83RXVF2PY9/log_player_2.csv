"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than John's price,  it's still above the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum value. This should incentivize her to consider it, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference at $8,750. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,875.  This feels like a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is close to my desired price range and is significantly better than John's offer.  While I could potentially negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a price much lower, and risking further rounds might lead to Alice getting impatient and withdrawing the deal.  It's time to secure a good deal."
