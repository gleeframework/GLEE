"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
