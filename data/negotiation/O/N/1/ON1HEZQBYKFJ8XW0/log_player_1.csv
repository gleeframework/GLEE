Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase [product name] for [price]. It's a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss it further. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. I'm also leaving the door open for further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while ensuring that Bob doesn't simply reject the offer outright. By starting with a slightly higher price, I allow for potential negotiation and potentially earn more than my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I have a backup buyer in John, guaranteeing I won't lose out."
