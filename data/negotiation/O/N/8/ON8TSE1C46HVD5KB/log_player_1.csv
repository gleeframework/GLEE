Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
     
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential"" I am framing the product as an investment opportunity, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping John ($1,000,000 guaranteed) in my back pocket. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and take the sure thing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** His counter-offer suggests he's interested, but trying to secure a bargain. There's a large gap between our positions, leaving ample room for negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  While I haven't revealed John, he serves as my safety net. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he doesn't move closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's on offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Firm:**  I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm holding firm above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's ""potential"" to keep Bob focused on long-term benefits and justify the high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to guide Bob towards a more reasonable range. It keeps the negotiation active while signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I could meet you halfway at $1,000,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Expectations:** Bob has now met both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value of the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a sure profit.
* **John is No Longer a Factor:** Since Bob's offer matches John's, there's no longer a benefit to walking away from the negotiation. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,000,000 is the most logical choice at this point."
