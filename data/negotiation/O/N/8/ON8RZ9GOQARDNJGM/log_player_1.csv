Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500. There are still rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $9,200? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $9,000 is a decent price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
