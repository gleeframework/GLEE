"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer acknowledges that negotiation is expected, showing a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is tempting, we're still in early rounds. Rejecting now signals that we're serious about a higher price and willing to negotiate further. We have room to come down while still aiming for a significantly better outcome than John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but that price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,120,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We want to keep the negotiation moving positively, so we acknowledge Bob's counteroffer.
* **Firm but Fair:** We're coming down in price, but not drastically. A $30,000 decrease shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the product's value to subtly anchor Bob's perception above his offer. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The tone suggests a willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,100,000 to make this deal happen today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,100,000 is a strong profit margin, significantly exceeding John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now eliminates the risk of prolonged negotiation or Bob walking away. 
* **""Bird in Hand"":** Securing a good deal now outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in later rounds."
