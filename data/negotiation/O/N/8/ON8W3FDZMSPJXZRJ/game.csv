"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love, and I think this price is a fair reflection of its value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $1,200,000. However, I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting the best possible price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for it. Can we discuss further to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get the best price for the product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
