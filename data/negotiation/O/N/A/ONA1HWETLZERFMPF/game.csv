"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm prepared to offer you $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,650,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
