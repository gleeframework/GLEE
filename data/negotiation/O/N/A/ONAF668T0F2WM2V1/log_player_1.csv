Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to appeal to Bob's desire for a valuable asset.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can potentially settle somewhere above your minimum while still securing a significant profit.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while considering your fallback option of selling to John."
