"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and you to get the product at a competitive price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $92.50. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $92.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $94. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal. ",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $94 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $92 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer you the product for $93. This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let's finalize this deal!",93.0,Alice,7,
