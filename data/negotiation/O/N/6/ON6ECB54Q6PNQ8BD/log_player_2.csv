"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is within his budget, he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $1,250,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer to his original counteroffer, there's still potential for further negotiation.  Bob should continue trying to get a better price by rejecting and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both parties.  His previous offer of $1,250,000 was rejected, so he is raising his offer slightly to $1,300,000. This is still within his budget and could be a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is now above Bob's maximum budget.  There is no further room for negotiation that would be beneficial to Bob. At this point, it is more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within his budget and the most cost-effective option."
