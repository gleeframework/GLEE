"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,200. I believe this price is more in line with its worth, but I'm still open to negotiations.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,100. I believe this price is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business.",8100.0,Alice,5,
