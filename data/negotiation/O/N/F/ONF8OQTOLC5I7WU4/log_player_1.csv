"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** By not going for the full $120 immediately, I create an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a deal closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **Time Remaining:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I have enough time to try to close a deal closer to my desired price. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still refuses, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time for Leverage:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have the opportunity to push for a higher price. I believe that rejecting his offer and making another counteroffer will ultimately lead to a better deal.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  I am willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm trying to be fair. I'm willing to go down to $98. That's a good price for both of us, and it's just a couple of dollars away from your last offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm getting closer to my limit but still have room to bargain. 
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the small difference between my offer and Bob's, making it seem like a minor hurdle to overcome.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm again appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by highlighting that $98 is a ""good price for both of us.""
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to start getting closer to a deal while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Continues:** With 4 rounds left, I have time to try to push for a higher price and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired value.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  I am willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us.

I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $92 is just a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to compromise, though. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This offer is a clear compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that $95 is ""fair"" and gets us closer to a deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging acceptance. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to close this deal if possible. This offer gives Bob a reasonable price while still allowing me to earn more than his initial offer.
* **Last Stand:** If Bob rejects this offer, I may have to consider selling to John, as I am running out of time and the remaining rounds may not be enough to significantly increase the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, I've already offered $92, and I'm not willing to go above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $93? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the last two rounds, and there's a very high chance that we won't be able to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Value Gap:** Even with Bob's latest offer, the price is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a certain profit. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a high risk of not reaching a deal at all.

While it's disappointing to not close a deal with Bob,  it's crucial to prioritize maximizing my profit, and selling to John offers the most secure outcome in this situation."
