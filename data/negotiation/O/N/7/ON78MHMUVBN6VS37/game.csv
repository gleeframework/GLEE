"Alice,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum price, considering my own value for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that still acknowledges the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
