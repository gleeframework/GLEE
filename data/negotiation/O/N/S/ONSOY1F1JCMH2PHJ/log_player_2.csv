"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my budget and my alternative buying option. I should negotiate for a lower price."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:Starting with a significantly lower offer than my budget allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $100 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay and more than John's offer. I'll continue negotiating but be prepared to walk away."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $100 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:I'm increasing my offer slightly but staying below my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm limit."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $75 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll accept $85. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:Alice's offer of $85 is only slightly above my alternative option of buying from John for $80. It's a reasonable compromise, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better price. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."")
