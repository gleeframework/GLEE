"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $95 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90, but I'm still not quite there. How about $92? That's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen.",91.0,Bob,6,
