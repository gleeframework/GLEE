"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than his initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $95 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have time and I'm not yet convinced I can't get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90, but I'm still not quite there. How about $92? That's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $91 is still a bit lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. It's better to secure a sale now than risk going through more rounds and potentially losing both Bob and John."
