Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my valuation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
