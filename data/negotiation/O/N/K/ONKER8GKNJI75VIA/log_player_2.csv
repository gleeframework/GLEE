"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value. You have room to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

I believe this is a fair price given my valuation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1090000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value, but closer to your counteroffer.  You can likely push her a bit further, as she has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives you the chance to get closer to your desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,090,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly lower price. I'd like to offer $1,070,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a slightly lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1080000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm proposing a new price of $1080000, with a small sweetener: I'll throw in a complimentary service package worth $20000. This package will enhance the product's value to you and make it an even more attractive investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum value.  Adding the complimentary service package worth $20,000 makes it a very good deal, as you're essentially getting the product for $1,060,000.  It's unlikely you'll be able to push her lower, and John's price of $1,000,000 is only a $80,000 difference. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
