Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $80, which is your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $90 is below Bob's perceived value of $100, so there's room for him to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is direct and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $70 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can sell to John for $80, which is more than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is above your minimum:** $85 is above your minimum selling price of $80.
* **Counteroffer is still below Bob's perceived value:** $85 is below Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Clear and concise message:**  The message is direct and reiterates your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** $75 is still less than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** You can sell to John for $80, which is more than Bob's offer and meets your minimum.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob's counteroffers have been progressively lower, suggesting he may not be willing to meet your minimum.  

Selling to John ensures you get a guaranteed price that meets your minimum requirements."
