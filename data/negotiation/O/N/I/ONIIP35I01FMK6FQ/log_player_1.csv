"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that John's offer of $150 will be a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell the product for a loss.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum and I'm confident that I can do better than selling to John.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm ready to close the deal."
