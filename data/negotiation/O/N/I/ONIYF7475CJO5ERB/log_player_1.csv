"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, given that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better deal from Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too low, and I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for that amount just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500.  This is a significant compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob. I'm also aware that I have limited rounds left and need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John for $10,000 than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
