"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
