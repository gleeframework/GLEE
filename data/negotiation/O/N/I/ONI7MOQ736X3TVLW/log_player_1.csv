Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($100) and Bob's estimated value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm suggesting the product is something Bob would value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to prompt Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

This strategy allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a price close to my target while also being prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his estimated value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:** I believe I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, which is still a good outcome. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** My counteroffer of $95 is still above my minimum ($100) but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. This also falls within what Bob likely sees as a reasonable range since he was willing to go up to $85.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the price as a ""good deal"" for Bob, appealing to his sense of getting a bargain.
* **Open to Compromise:**  The phrase ""find common ground"" emphasizes my willingness to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a final agreement.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a longer process, potentially leading to Bob backing out or me losing interest in selling to him. 
* **Safeguard with John:** I have the option to sell to John for $100 if this deal falls through.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is close to my minimum, and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
