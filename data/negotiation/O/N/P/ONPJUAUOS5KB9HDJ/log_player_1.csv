This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for potential compromise while ensuring you still receive a profit.  It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'd be willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is still a significant sum, it falls below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value."
