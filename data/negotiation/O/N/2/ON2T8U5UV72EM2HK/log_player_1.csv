"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. To kickstart our negotiation, I propose an initial price of $1,300,000. This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to exploring possibilities together."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** I'm starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even my own minimum ($1,000,000). This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for strategic concessions.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes this is an ""initial price"" and a ""starting point."" I want Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than be immediately scared off.
* **Value-Focused:**  While not explicitly stating the product's benefits, I hint at its significance and potential value to Bob, aiming to pique his interest. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's appetite and negotiation style.  Depending on his response, I can adjust my approach in subsequent rounds.  I'm willing to negotiate down, but I want to maximize my profit beyond John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to make a more substantial investment in the product. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so there's no incentive for me to settle for less. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about the value of the product.  I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap but still keeps me above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective on the product's value.  I've considered your offer carefully. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects the true worth of this unique product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've come down from my initial offer but remain significantly above Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's ""true worth,"" subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher value.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a ""solution that works for both of us,"" encouraging Bob to collaborate and potentially move closer to my price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to close the deal with Bob above John's offer.  I'm willing to make further concessions, but I want to gauge his reaction to this counteroffer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,150,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly staying below my minimum.  His offer to ""meet halfway"" is a negotiation tactic, but it doesn't align with the actual value of the product or my bottom line.  I need to show him I'm serious about my price.

**Strategy:**

It's time to leverage my alternative option. By rejecting this offer, I'm subtly signaling to Bob that I have other potential buyers. This might make him more willing to move closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but your current offer doesn't reflect the product's real value or the significant benefits it offers.  I've had other interested parties, but I believe this product is a perfect fit for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,050,000. This is a firm price, as I have alternative options available."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stand:** I'm making it clear that $1,050,000 is my final offer. This shows I'm serious about the price and won't go lower.
* **Limited Flexibility:** By mentioning ""a final offer"" and ""alternative options,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and subtly suggesting that John's offer is on the table.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've come down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum.

**Strategy:** 

This offer is designed to be my last move. It gives Bob a chance to secure the product at a price slightly above my minimum while clearly communicating my boundaries.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant benefits, but I've done my research and I believe $850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product at this price. I'd like to move forward with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is anchored to his $850,000 offer and doesn't seem willing to budge. It's clear he's unlikely to meet my ""final offer"" from the previous round. I've been firm, signaled my alternatives, and it's time to act in my best interest. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which exceeds any potential gains from further haggling with Bob. It's a good deal, and I'm confident in my decision."
