Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 gives me some room to negotiate down. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider a deal.
* **Flexibility:** The message indicates I'm open to offers, which shows I'm willing to work with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to either negotiate further with Bob or move on to John if his counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer meets my minimum value of $8,000. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the quickest and most efficient way to secure the sale and avoid further negotiations.

While I might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of a prolonged negotiation or losing the deal altogether isn't worth it."
