"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  While $1,200,000 is appealing, it's a significant way off from what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I could consider $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
