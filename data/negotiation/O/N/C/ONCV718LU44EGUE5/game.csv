"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the opportunity cost of going elsewhere. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value to me while staying within my budget. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $980,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings for you compared to selling it to John.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980,000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
