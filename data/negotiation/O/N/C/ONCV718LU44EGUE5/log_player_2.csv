# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is way above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still significantly higher than his budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still over $250,000 more than he's willing to pay.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further.  If not, Bob can always buy from John."

Bob has been persistent in his negotiations, but Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,020,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's budget and his desired price.  At this point, it's more financially sensible for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
