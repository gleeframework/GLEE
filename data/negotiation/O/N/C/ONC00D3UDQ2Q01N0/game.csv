"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $95.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle on $75?  That's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to go to $75, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $82.50? It's a compromise, but it's closer to what I'm looking for.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  To meet you halfway, how about $78?  That's my final offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $78 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about $82? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",82.0,Alice,7,
