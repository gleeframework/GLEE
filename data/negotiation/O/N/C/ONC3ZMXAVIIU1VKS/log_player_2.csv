"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Alice's offer is better, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's below the $1,000,000 you could pay John, but above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still less than the $1,000,000 you could pay John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price you're comfortable with, and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation."
