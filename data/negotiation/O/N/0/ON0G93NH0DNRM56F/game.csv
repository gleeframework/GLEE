"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and a fair reflection of its value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is quite a bit below my initial ask. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $2,000,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,850,000? It's a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,925,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while still valuing the product appropriately.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I'm sticking to my price point of $1,850,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
