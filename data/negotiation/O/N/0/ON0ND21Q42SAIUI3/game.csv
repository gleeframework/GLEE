"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still a little too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. It's a fair price for both of us. We're getting closer, and I'd really like to close this deal with you. However, with limited time remaining, I'll need to seriously consider other options if we can't reach an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that I might need to explore other options if we can't agree on a price.",990000.0,Bob,8,
