"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to potentially earn closer to my target of $1,000,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us. This aims to make Bob more receptive to the offer and less likely to immediately reject it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the door open for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adapt my strategy. If he rejects, I'll need to consider whether to lower my offer or sell to John. If he accepts, I've achieved a great outcome!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $900,000 is still below my minimum goal of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Strategic advantage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially push him closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3. My goal will be to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while still ensuring I get as close to my $1,000,000 goal as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm reducing my price by $100,000 from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the ""unique value"" of the product to emphasize its worth. 
* **Motivating action:** I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to take action and accept my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my counteroffer and accept it. If he rejects again, I'll need to carefully assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing further. The goal is to maximize my profit while still securing a sale within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum goal of $1,000,000. 
* **The pressure tactic:** While Bob claims it's his ""final offer,""  I'm not convinced. He's likely using this as a pressure tactic to get me to accept. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I still have 6 rounds left. It's possible that Bob is willing to go higher if he feels the pressure to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5. My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, but I'm not going to accept anything lower than $1,000,000 unless I'm running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and pressure:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $1,050,000, but I'm also subtly applying pressure by mentioning the possibility of selling to another buyer. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still ensuring that I'm above my minimum goal of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, we've successfully closed the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess the situation carefully. I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or continue to negotiate and try to push Bob closer to my desired price.  If I'm running out of rounds, I may have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $980,000 is still below my minimum goal of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, time is becoming a factor.
* **Potential for higher offer:** While Bob claims his offer is final, I'm not convinced. There's still room to push for a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not in a rush to accept a sub-optimal deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob in Round 7. I'll aim to close the deal as close to $1,000,000 as possible, but I'm prepared to sell to John if I can't secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still a little too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. It's a fair price for both of us. We're getting closer, and I'd really like to close this deal with you. However, with limited time remaining, I'll need to seriously consider other options if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,020,000 is still above my minimum goal, but it's a significant compromise from my previous offer.
* **Time pressure:** I'm reminding Bob that we have limited rounds remaining, adding pressure for a quick decision.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Compromise and finality:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise while subtly hinting that this might be my final offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal! If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round. The risk of losing a substantial amount of money is higher with fewer rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that I might need to explore other options if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** $990,000 is only $10,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my target of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the chances of closing a deal with Bob at a higher price are slim.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Risk of no deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to no deal at all, leaving me with no profit.

**Next Steps:**

Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. I'm maximizing my potential earnings while minimizing the risk of losing out on any profit."
