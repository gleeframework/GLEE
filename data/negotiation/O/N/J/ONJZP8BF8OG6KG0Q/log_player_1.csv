Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving you some profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), so he has room to negotiate if he wants to. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation without immediately jumping to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? This would still leave you a good value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. How about $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
