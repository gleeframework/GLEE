Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it also shows him that I believe the product is valuable.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than what John is offering, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's also a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for that amount, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair offer that shows my willingness to work with Bob, while still ensuring that I get a reasonable price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, it seems like we're at an impasse.  He's not willing to go higher than $1,150,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it makes more sense to sell to him and secure the $1,200,000."
