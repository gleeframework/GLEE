"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in buying it for $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $105 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $98. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",98.0,Alice,5,
