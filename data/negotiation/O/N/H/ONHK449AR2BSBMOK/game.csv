"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $90 is closer but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
