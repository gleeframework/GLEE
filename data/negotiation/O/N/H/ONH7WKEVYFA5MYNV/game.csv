"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 seems a bit steep for me, would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $140 is closer, but still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $125 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - $132.50. I'm willing to go lower than my initial asking price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out.  I'm happy to meet in the middle, but  $132.50 still feels high. How about a flat $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
