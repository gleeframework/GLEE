{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is significantly above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable price considering the product's value to Bob. I'm confident this will start a productive conversation with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $80, it's still lower than my desired selling price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it gives me a fair price as well."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay and it's close to my desired price. Accepting this offer is the best option for maximizing my profit."
