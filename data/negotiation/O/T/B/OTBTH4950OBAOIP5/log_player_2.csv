{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is only worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $120.

* It's too early to buy from John as I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above my maximum willingness to pay. 
* This is a strong opening move to signal my seriousness about negotiating, while leaving room for further discussion. 
* I'm hoping Alice will be willing to compromise and meet me somewhere in the middle."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Offering $95 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to move up from my previous offer while leaving room for further negotiation.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $102, which is only $2 more than what the product is worth to me. 
* Given that I'm approaching the halfway point of negotiations, I'm not confident I can negotiate a much lower price. 
* Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise, as I'm still saving some money compared to buying from John."
