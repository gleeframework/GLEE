"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $800000? I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is significantly below my minimum price point.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, while offering you a significant opportunity.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we set the price at $950000? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects your needs and keeps my budget in mind.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we settle on $1050000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's try to get closer to my budget. How about we set the price at $1025000? I think this would be a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
