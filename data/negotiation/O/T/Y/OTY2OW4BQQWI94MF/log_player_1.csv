Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for my valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $50,000 difference between your offer and Bob's potential value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher offer might scare Bob off, while a lower offer might make you miss out on potential profits.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he counters, you can then decide to accept, counter with a new offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below your ideal target. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, you show Bob that you're not desperate and willing to settle.
* **Potentially increase the price:** A counteroffer from you might push the price closer to your desired $950,000.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:** His initial rejection and counteroffer show he's interested but hesitant. A second counteroffer from you could gauge his commitment.

**Next steps:**

You'll now need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price point that is a bit higher than his offer but still lower than your initial offer. This will give him a chance to negotiate while showing that you're willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $900,000.  This would allow me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  I'm open to discussing further compromises to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. It's a good midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reminding Bob that the product is valuable allows you to justify a slightly higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  By mentioning ""further compromises"", you show flexibility and a willingness to work with Bob.

This counteroffer should help you inch closer to your desired price while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is still lower than your ideal price, it's a good deal considering:

* **It's close to your minimum:**  $875,000 is only $75,000 away from your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Bob is likely firm:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but also a firm stance on his budget. Pushing for a higher price might lead to a stalemate.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might drag out the process and potentially jeopardize the deal.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and brings you closer to your desired price.  It's a wise choice considering the potential risks and rewards involved."
