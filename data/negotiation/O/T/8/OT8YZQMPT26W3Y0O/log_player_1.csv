Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum but leaves Bob with some perceived value. Offering it at $1,300,000 gives Bob a $200,000 discount from his perceived value while netting you a $500,000 profit over your fallback option.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential gain while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
