"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit steep at $2000000, and I'd like to discuss the price further to see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1400000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1600000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
