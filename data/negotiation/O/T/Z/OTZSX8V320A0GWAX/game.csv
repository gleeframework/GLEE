"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the middle ground offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $1,000,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's get this deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $980,000? I think we can both be happy with this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $980,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're still trying to get to your target price, but I'm not willing to go above $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",990000.0,Bob,8,
