"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1300000.  This price reflects a significant discount and represents a great opportunity for you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet a price higher than $1200000. I propose we aim for $1225000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
