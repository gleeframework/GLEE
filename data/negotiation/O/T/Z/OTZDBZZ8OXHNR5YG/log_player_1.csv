I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm happy to receive an offer at my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum value of $1,000,000 and represents a reasonable compromise.  It's not ideal, but it's a solid deal and worth accepting."
