"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $16,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $14,000. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
