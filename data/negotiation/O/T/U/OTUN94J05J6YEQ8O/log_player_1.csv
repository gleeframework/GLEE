Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know is valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you and me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $16,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $14,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $14,000 is a good compromise and a solid deal.  It's better than waiting for more rounds and potentially risking selling to John for less, and I can still make a profit."
