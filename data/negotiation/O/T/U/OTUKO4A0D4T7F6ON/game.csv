"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, if I do say so myself!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $108. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",108.0,Alice,5,
