"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows us both to save some money.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to put pressure on her to negotiate.  Bob is starting strong, but still within a range that makes sense for both parties.  The message is friendly yet firm, emphasizing the benefit for both sides of the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still only two rounds away from his best option with John. There's still room to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his $950,000 offer.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm sticking with my offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal.  Let's find a way to make it work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer, demonstrating his commitment to securing the product for a lower price. The message reinforces the mutual benefit of the deal, keeping the negotiation positive while reiterating his stance. This strategy aims to push Alice further towards his desired price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still only $75,000 away from his best option with John, and with five rounds remaining, there is still room for Alice to come down further.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me.  However, I'm still hoping to close this deal at a lower price.  I'm offering $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to save money, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is only $12,500 away from his best option with John. With four rounds left, there's still potential for Alice to come down further, especially since she's already stated she's close to her minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm offering $987,500.  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. Let's close this deal and get this product in my hands!"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now only $25,000 away from his best alternative. This counteroffer shows he is serious about closing the deal but is also willing to meet Alice halfway. The message is positive and emphasizes the urgency of closing the deal, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,007,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,007,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,007,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice. He's only $7,500 away from his best alternative with John.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's risky to continue negotiating.  With only one round left, there's not enough time to potentially get a better price.  Therefore, Bob should go with the guaranteed price from John and close the deal."
