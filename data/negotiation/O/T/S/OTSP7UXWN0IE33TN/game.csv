"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd love to offer you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given you value it at $10000. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for something a little higher.  Let's split the difference. How about $12500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12500 is still outside of my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I can only go as high as $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's halfway between our last offers.",11000.0,Bob,4,
