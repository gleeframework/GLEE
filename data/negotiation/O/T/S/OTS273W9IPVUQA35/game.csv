"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $80, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $81.50. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",81.5,Alice,5,
