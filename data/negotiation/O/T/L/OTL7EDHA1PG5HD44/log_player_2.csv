"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this counter-offer:

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message conveys that I'm interested in the product while also being clear about my budget limitations.
* **Significant Difference:** The $40 difference from Alice's offer might seem large, but it allows for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $100 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're making progress! Alice is coming down, which means there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Steady Progress:** We're moving closer to a price that's good for me, while still giving Alice room to negotiate further.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm still aware that I can buy from John for $150, so I won't go above that."
