"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1000000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value to me.
