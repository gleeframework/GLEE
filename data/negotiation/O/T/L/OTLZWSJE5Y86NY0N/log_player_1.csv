Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My initial offer is $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm trying to build some rapport and pique Bob's interest.  I'm not revealing too much information about the product's value to me yet. 
* **John as a backup:**  Remember, I have John as a safety net, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $100. Since I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130:**  This is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining my stance that it's too low.  I'm also framing $130 as a fair price, not just an arbitrary number. 
* **Flexibility:**  By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating a willingness to work with Bob, which could increase the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $120. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is acceptable:** While it's still below my initial target, it's above my minimum desired price of $100. 
* **Risk of losing John:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Bob walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting $120, I can secure a sale and move on to other opportunities.  Further negotiation may not be worth the time and effort.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision."
