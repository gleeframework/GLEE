"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
