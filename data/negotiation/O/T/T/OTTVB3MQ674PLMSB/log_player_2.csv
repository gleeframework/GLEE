"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,750? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $13,750 is lower than John's $15,000 price.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's likely Alice is now firm on her price, and further negotiations might risk losing the deal. 
* **Meeting halfway:** Alice has already moved significantly from her original price.  Accepting this offer represents a good compromise."
