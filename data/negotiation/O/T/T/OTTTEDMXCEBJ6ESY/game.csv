"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not at a number that works for me. I can offer you $11,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer before I start considering other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $10,000. That's a fair price considering your initial offer and my desired budget.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,
