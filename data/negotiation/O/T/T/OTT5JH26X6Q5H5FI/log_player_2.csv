# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:

This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
