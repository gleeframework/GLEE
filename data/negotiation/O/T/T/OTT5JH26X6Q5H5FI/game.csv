"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $850,000 for the product. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while also keeping my budget in mind.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $900,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
