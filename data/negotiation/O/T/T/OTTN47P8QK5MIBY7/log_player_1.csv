Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **A friendly message:** It's important to keep the tone positive and establish a good relationship.
* **Mentioning Bob's perceived value:**  This subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefit he'll get by buying the product.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and will ultimately decide whether to accept his counteroffer or sell to John if the price isn't right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $14000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I believe I can still get a better price.  

* **Reason for rejection:**  While $13,000 is tempting, I want to try to maximize my profit and see if I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Next steps:** I'll counteroffer to try and close the gap, but I'm aware that I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a price significantly higher than $13,000. I also need to keep in mind that John is willing to pay $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet halfway, while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll receive.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to maintain a positive negotiating environment.

**Strategy:**

* I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to go slightly higher. 
* If he rejects this offer, I'll consider accepting his previous offer or moving on to John depending on how much time I'm willing to invest in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13200 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000, Bob's offer of $13,200 is getting too close to the $13,000 price I rejected before.  I'm worried that further negotiations will be time-consuming and ultimately not result in a significantly better price. 

Given that John is willing to pay $15,000, selling to him is the most logical choice. It guarantees me my desired profit and saves me the effort of further negotiations."
