Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob the chance to buy at a price that's still a good deal for him, and it allows me to get the full value I'm looking for.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I will reject Bob's offer of $10,000. While it's tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a compromise price of $11,000. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's initial offer, and a fair middle ground.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reconsider selling to John, as $11,000 is still a decent price for me."
