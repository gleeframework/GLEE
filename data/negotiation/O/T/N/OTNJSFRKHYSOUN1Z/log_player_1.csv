Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $80 but leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I believe this is a reasonable price point that will allow us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum price of $80 and higher than what John is offering.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
