"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $9,500.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. If you decline, I will have to sell it to another buyer for $8,000.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you're taking a calculated risk. There's a chance Alice might lower her price to avoid selling it for less to someone else. Even if she doesn't, you're still within your budget with John."
