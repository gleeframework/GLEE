Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it presents a significant value at this price, and I'm eager to see it put to good use."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.  It's unlikely he'll accept a price too close to $15,000 since it's only worth $12,000 to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, leading to a mutually beneficial agreement within your acceptable range.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while maintaining a professional and encouraging tone."
