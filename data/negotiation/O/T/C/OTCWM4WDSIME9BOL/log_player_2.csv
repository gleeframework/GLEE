# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to you, there's room for negotiation. It's more advantageous to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue to negotiate and try to push her down towards my price point of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a premium. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I've already negotiated as much as I can and I don't want to risk further negotiation leading to a stalemate or a price I'm not comfortable with.  At this point, it's more prudent to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
