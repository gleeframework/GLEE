Round 2
Bob's offer:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,570,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We're still well above my minimum price and securing a healthy profit.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations further risks losing Bob without a guarantee of a better offer. 
* **Bird in Hand:** Accepting a solid offer now is generally better than risking the uncertainty of future rounds."
