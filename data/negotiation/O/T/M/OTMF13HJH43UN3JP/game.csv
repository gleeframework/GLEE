"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work. How about $1,400,000?  This is a significant compromise from my side, and I'm confident this price would still represent a strong value for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too far off for me. I've thought carefully about our negotiations, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
