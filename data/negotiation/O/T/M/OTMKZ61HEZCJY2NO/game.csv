"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $850,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still committed to getting you the best possible price. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's fair to both of us and allows me to continue working with you.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, so how about $775,000? That's the best I can do.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $775,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. How about we settle on $790,000? That's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $790,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to go up to $785,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",785000.0,Bob,6,
