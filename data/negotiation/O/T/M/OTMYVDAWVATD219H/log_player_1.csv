"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:**  This establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. It shows that I value the product highly and am confident in its worth.
* **Room for compromise:** By starting high, I create space for potential compromises and ultimately a deal that is beneficial for both parties. 
* **Assessing Bob's interest:**  This first offer will help me understand how much value Bob places on the product. If he accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, we can move on to counter-offers.

**Important Note:** 

This is just the beginning. The strategy will evolve based on Bob's responses. If he doesn't engage, I'll need to adjust my approach, potentially lowering the price or even considering John's offer if the rounds are getting close to the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting my minimum value:**  My minimum value is $1,000,000, and Bob's offer is far below that. Accepting would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's low offer shows that he's willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can set a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. 
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 2. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm not in a rush to sell at a price I'm not comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to consider his offer carefully and attempt to bridge the gap while ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sending a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still reflects my minimum value and allows for further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and progress:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price. This demonstrates that I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This allows for a potential middle ground. 
* **Assessing Bob's commitment:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's true interest. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have more information to guide my next move. 

**Important Note:**

I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a safety net and a clear benchmark for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price with further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** My goal is to maximize my profit, and I'm confident that I can get closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Time and leverage:**  We are only in round 4. I have 6 rounds left, giving me ample time to negotiate further.
* **Assessing Bob's commitment:**  Bob's incremental offer shows that he's willing to move closer to my price point. This strengthens my position.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round.  I'll aim to bridge the gap further and  hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired price.  I will also be keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and will need to consider John's offer if the time is running out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sending a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This represents another step towards meeting Bob halfway while still protecting my minimum value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental progress:** This offer is a smaller increase from my previous offer, showing a commitment to finding common ground.
* **Strategic positioning:** I'm trying to create a sense of urgency for Bob. He's clearly interested, but I'm demonstrating that I'm not willing to budge too much.
* **Balancing options:**  While I'd prefer to close with Bob, I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh my options more carefully as the rounds progress.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, I'll need to analyze the remaining rounds and potentially adjust my strategy to secure a deal before the time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value,  I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target and it's worth risking a few more rounds of negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and I believe I can get closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Time and leverage:** We are in round 6 with 4 rounds remaining. I have enough time to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to come closer.
* **Assessing Bob's commitment:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, but he's still not meeting my minimum. This suggests there is still room for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll aim to bridge the gap further and hopefully secure a deal that's closer to my desired price. However, I'll be carefully considering John's offer as the rounds progress.  If time is running out, I may need to accept a price closer to my minimum value rather than risk losing the deal entirely."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sending a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value and demonstrates a commitment to finding a middle ground. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, and I want to ensure I don't lose the deal. This offer is a compromise that keeps me above my minimum value while showing Bob I'm serious about closing.
* **Building Urgency:**  With only three rounds left, I want to create a sense of urgency for Bob. If he rejects, I'll have fewer chances to reach a deal.
* **Assessing Bob's Commitment:**  Bob's increasing offers indicate he's serious about buying. This counteroffer will help me gauge his final willingness to pay.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider John's offer more seriously and potentially adjust my strategy in the final rounds.  I'm still aiming for the best possible price, but I'm also aware of the risks of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  This is my minimum value, and with only two rounds remaining, it's the best outcome I can reasonably expect.  While I'd love to get more, it's not worth risking the deal and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John for the same amount.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** This offer meets my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds for negotiation. It's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers and continue negotiating.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Accepting the offer secures a deal and avoids the possibility of losing out entirely if I continue to reject offers.

**Next Steps:**

The deal is closed, and I've successfully sold the product for my minimum value.  I'll be sure to consider strategies for future negotiations and to try to maximize profits in subsequent deals."
