"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I'm still not willing to go as low as $160, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $170. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",170.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate after my final offer. I'm not willing to budge from $170, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus worth $5 to sweeten the deal. I'll offer you the product for $170 and the bonus. This is my last offer.",170.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the bonus, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $167 for the product without the bonus.",167.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to give up on this deal yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not willing to sacrifice the bonus. I'll offer you the product for $172, which is $3 more than your latest offer, and I'll still throw in the $5 bonus. This is my last offer.",172.0,Alice,9,
