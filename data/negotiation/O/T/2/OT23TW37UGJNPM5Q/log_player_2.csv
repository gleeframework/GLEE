You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget and hopefully enticing enough for her to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John.  I'll accept it to avoid further negotiation."
