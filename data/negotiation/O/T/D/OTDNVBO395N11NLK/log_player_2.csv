"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price and Alice's offer is still above his target price of $800,000.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer. However, I still believe this product is worth more than $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob can continue negotiating, aiming to push Alice towards his desired price point. There are still rounds available to work out a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $840,000.  This is a good middle ground, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe this product is worth more than $840,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $860,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made significant concessions and is now offering a price that's very close to Bob's target price.  Accepting the offer at $860,000 is a good deal for Bob, saving him $140,000 compared to buying from John.  While there is a chance he might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely to another seller, or to Alice changing her mind, is high.  It's wiser to secure the product at a favorable price than to risk getting nothing."
