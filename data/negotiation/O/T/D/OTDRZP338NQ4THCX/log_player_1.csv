Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I would get from John. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($150).  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm going to counter with $160.  This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my initial price, and hopefully entices him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could potentially try to get a bit more, it's unlikely he'll go higher. I'm happy to accept his offer and move on."
