Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still leaving me with a profit above my minimum value. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, so I can always walk away from Bob if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and even below my starting offer of $14,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob has shown interest, his low offer indicates he's trying to push for a big discount. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the luxury of not having to settle for Bob's low offer. I can reject his offer and try to push for a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $12,500 is a significant move towards Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm aiming for a price that is fair to both of us, considering the product's worth and Bob's budget constraints.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $11500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but it's still significantly lower. 
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially with John's offer as a safety net.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, which suggests there's a possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $12,000 is a smaller move towards Bob's offer, but it keeps me above my minimum value. 
* **Last Stand:**  This might be my last offer before I seriously consider John's offer.  I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to close the deal.
* **Positive and Firm:**  The message is positive and firm, emphasizing my willingness to compromise while also highlighting the product's value."
