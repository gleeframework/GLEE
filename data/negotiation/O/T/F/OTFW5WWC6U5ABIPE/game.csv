This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more.
