"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
