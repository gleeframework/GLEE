Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,100,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations falling through."
