"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential for you, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,100,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
