It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $1,200,000."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $1,000,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, but it also gives her room to bargain."

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to move, but still trying to get a better price than her last offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

Alice has come up a bit, and we're getting closer to a reasonable price. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with nothing or having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential benefit of getting a slightly better price.  It's time to accept the offer."
