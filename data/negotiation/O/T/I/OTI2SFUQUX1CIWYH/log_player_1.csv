"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe the product is worth it to me, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and try $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,750, so I'm thinking $8,000 is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I would prefer to get more, accepting his offer secures a sale and guarantees my minimum desired profit.  I've already rejected two of his offers and don't want to risk further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. Selling to John for the same price is a viable option, but I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob if possible."
