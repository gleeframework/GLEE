"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and try $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us. ",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,750, so I'm thinking $8,000 is a fair price. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,
