"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? That would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $102. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
