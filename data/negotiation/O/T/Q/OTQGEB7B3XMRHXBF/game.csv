"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to stay within your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $9,000 for the product?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $9,000 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we try $11,000? That's a significant compromise on my part, and it still allows you to stay within a reasonable range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This still falls within my desired price range, while also allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this suggestion will lead us to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
