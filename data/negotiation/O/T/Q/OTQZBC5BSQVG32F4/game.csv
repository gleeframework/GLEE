"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
