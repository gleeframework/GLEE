Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price for both of us: it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it still leaves some room for negotiation for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit, while also being more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
