"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is cheaper than buying from John, there's still room to negotiate. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's product is worth $80 to her, and Bob is willing to pay up to $150. Offering $100 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it splits the difference between their valuations. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still providing Bob with a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, offering $110. This is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $150. Accepting the offer saves Bob $40 compared to John, while still getting the product at a price below his maximum willingness to pay."
