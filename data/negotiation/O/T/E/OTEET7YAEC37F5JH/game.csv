"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that be acceptable?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's the best we can do at this point.",8000.0,Alice,5,
