"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best possible deal while also allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's worth. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $80 from John, which is significantly cheaper than Alice's $120 offer."
