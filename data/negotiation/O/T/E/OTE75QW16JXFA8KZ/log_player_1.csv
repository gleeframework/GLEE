Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers without hitting my absolute minimum. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter or move on to John, ensuring a good outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. It's a bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $820,000 is a decent amount, it's still far below my minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Room for counteroffers:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and continue negotiating.  There's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup option provides security. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John and ensure I receive at least my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $820,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which reflects the value this product offers you. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move on to other buyers if it's not acceptable."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  The counteroffer is a significant move from my initial $900,000, but it still keeps me above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the benefits of this product, justifying the price.
* **Final offer:**  I'm setting a clear deadline, putting pressure on Bob to decide.  This increases the chances he'll accept. 
* **Backup plan:**  I'm reiterating the possibility of selling to John, making it clear that I'm not desperate. 

This approach aims to push the negotiation towards a conclusion while still maintaining my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers that might never lead to a satisfactory price. 
* **John guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price of $1,000,000, which is a much safer and more profitable outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob. 

This decision prioritizes a guaranteed high profit over the potential for a slightly higher price with a much greater risk of a lower outcome."
