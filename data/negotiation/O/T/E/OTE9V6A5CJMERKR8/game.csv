"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a sizable profit.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for my business. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product, which is closer to the original price I was thinking of. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $920000 is still too low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we settle at $935000?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,5,
