"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $14,000 is already a competitive offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still not able to meet at $13,000. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $12,500. This would allow me to stay within my budget while also acknowledging the value of what you're offering.",12500.0,Bob,4,
