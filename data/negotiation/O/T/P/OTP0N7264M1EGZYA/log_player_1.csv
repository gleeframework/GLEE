``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  $600,000 is a long way from my minimum of $1,500,000, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and will push us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again. I'm hoping to close the gap further and secure a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be persuasive enough for Bob to accept,  as we're nearing my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price point, Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a fair price and secures a sale."
