Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I think that's a fair price for both of us.

I've reached the point where I'm willing to sell to John for $150. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already made several concessions.  I'm not going to risk losing the deal with John for a few dollars more with Bob."
