{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so a price of $100 is still within a reasonable range for him to consider.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  You are willing to sell for at least $150, so $100 gives you a buffer in case Bob rejects.

By offering a slightly lower price, you increase the chance of Bob accepting, while still ensuring you make a profit."
