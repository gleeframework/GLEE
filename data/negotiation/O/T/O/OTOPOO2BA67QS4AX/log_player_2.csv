 Alice is willing to sell the product for less than its value to her, indicating room for negotiation. I should try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price that works for me. I'll try again to get it lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of negotiation, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more. How about $98? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and a $2 difference isn't worth the risk of her backing out of the deal. Accepting at $98 secures a good price."
