"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is my bottom line.  I'm willing to let it go for that price, but I can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $20,000, which is outside of Bob's budget. Buying from John at $15,000 is the best option to stay within his budget."
