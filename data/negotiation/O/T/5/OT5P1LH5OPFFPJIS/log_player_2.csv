Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he's still trying to save as much as possible.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at 13500, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is a good price, he's still trying to save as much as possible. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He might also want to see if he can get John to lower his price slightly, which would allow him to close the deal sooner."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to make this deal work, but $13,500 is still a bit above what I can afford. Would you consider coming down to $13,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make this deal work, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to meet you at 13250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  He's already been negotiating with Alice for several rounds and they're not getting closer.  John offers a price that fits Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee that Bob can get a better deal with Alice in the remaining rounds."
