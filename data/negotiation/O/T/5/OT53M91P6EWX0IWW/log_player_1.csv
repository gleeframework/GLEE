Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would bring you significant value.  I'm willing to make a one-time offer at $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) is ideal for maximizing profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** The offer of $1,300,000 aims to find a sweet spot:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, potentially yielding a substantial profit.
    * It leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still keeping the price above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
