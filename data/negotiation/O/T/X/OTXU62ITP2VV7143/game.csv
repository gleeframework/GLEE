"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within this range.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
