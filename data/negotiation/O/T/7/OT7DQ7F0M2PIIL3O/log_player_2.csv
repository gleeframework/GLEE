{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's significantly lower than John's price, so there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}

Let's start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give us some room to negotiate and see how much Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still asking for more than half of what John would charge. We can likely get a better price with further negotiation.  Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

We'll increase our offer slightly to show good faith, but we still want to stay significantly below Alice's last price.  This should encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but Alice's offer is still too high. There's likely more room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

We'll raise our offer again, but by a smaller amount this time. This shows Alice we're serious about buying the product, but we're still looking for a better price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer to a good price, but there's still room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

Let's make one final push. We'll raise our offer slightly again to show that we're still interested, but we want to get as close to $650,000 as possible. This will give Alice an incentive to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is close enough to our desired price point.  It's better to secure the product for $690,000 than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price, or having to buy from John for $1,500,000."
