"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. It's worth $100 to you, but you're aiming for a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a decent deal for you, considering it's worth $100 to you.  While you could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might not budge further, and you'd end up paying the full $100 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price."
