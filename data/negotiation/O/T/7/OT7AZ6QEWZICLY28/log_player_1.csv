Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, but I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $900,000 is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, while also acknowledging the price difference.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts, I'll make a profit of $100,000.
* **Guarantee minimum value:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price of $1,000,000."
