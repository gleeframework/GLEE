Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, though unlikely. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

While Bob might reject the offer, this strategy gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit without losing the guaranteed sale to John."
