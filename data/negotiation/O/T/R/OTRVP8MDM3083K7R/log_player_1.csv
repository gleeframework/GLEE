Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a decent profit margin while leaving room for negotiation. I'll see what Bob's reaction is and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is far below my minimum price of $150, so I absolutely cannot accept that.  I'll counter with a higher offer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm countering with $125.  This is still above my minimum price of $150, but a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will prompt Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and counter again.  I'm hoping that a few more rounds will get Bob to come up to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 118}
```

I'm going to counter with $118. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, showing I'm still willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $115 is closer to my desired price, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure Bob is going to budge much further. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $150.  It's not as much as I hoped, but it's still above my minimum and I'm done with the negotiation."
