,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This gives us both a good price. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $9,800 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's get this done! ",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,150 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about $10,000? This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal right now.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,7,
