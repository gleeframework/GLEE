"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to you. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. I believe this price still represents a fair value for both of us, considering the product's worth to you and its value to me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However,  $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, allowing you to make a profit while remaining within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. Let's meet at $1,150,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
