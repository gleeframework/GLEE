"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price that's within both our budgets.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting close. I value your interest and to show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
