I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum and I'm getting a bit nervous about John's offer. I'll accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting stuck with the lower price from John."
