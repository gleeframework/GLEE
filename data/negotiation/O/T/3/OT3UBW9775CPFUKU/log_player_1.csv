Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't directly influence our starting point. Our goal is to maximize profit.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John. This sets a strong floor for our negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  We start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value but below John's offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" to frame the offer positively. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  We achieve a $350,000 profit, surpassing our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  We have room to negotiate down towards $1,000,000 while still aiming to stay above John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** We accept John's offer, securing our minimum profit of $0."
