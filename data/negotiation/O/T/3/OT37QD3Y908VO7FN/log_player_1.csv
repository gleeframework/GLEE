Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm starting to get worried about the time. I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob. If he doesn't come up, I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this deal work.  I can go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident you'll find the product's value worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum price.  Even though I'd prefer to close with Bob, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my desired amount."
