"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a much fairer starting point. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?  I'm not willing to go any lower than this, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'll meet you at $11,000, but that's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
