Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique product that you won't find elsewhere, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly while still staying well above our minimum price.
* **Justify the Price:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uniqueness to justify the high price tag.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still offering Bob a price he might find acceptable."
