"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a good value for the product.

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, Bob should still try to negotiate further. He can likely get a better price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $837,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500.

At this point, Bob has a good deal from Alice. It's only $12,500 more than his last offer and significantly less than what John is selling it for. It's worth accepting to save a considerable amount of money."
