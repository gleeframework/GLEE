"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $135 is closer to my budget than Alice's starting price, I have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $120 maximum.  It's a starting point to see how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate the offer, $100 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has matched John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as I won't find a better deal elsewhere."
