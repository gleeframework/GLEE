"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately sell to John for the minimum."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,250. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a fair compromise considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation.
