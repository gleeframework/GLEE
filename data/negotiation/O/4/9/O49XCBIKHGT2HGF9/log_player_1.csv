Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.

This reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. But $1,150,000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm still not quite comfortable at $1,250,000.  How about $1,225,000? This is a fair compromise that keeps us both within our target ranges.  Let's seal the deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
