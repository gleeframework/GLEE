,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,300,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. But $1,150,000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm still not quite comfortable at $1,250,000.  How about $1,225,000? This is a fair compromise that keeps us both within our target ranges.  Let's seal the deal!",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close now!  I'm willing to come down to $1,240,000. This is a good deal for both of us. I know you want a great price, and I want to make this sale. Let's shake hands on this!",1240000.0,Alice,7,
