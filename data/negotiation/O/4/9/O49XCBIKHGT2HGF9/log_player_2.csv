"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  As Bob, I'm trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,300,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. But $1,150,000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget. However, it's getting close, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push her down further to my target price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm still not quite comfortable at $1,250,000.  How about $1,225,000? This is a fair compromise that keeps us both within our target ranges.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're very close now!  I'm willing to come down to $1,240,000. This is a good deal for both of us. I know you want a great price, and I want to make this sale. Let's shake hands on this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,240,000 is still above my budget.  While we're close, I've only got a few rounds left.  To ensure I get the product within my budget, it's safer to buy from John at $1,200,000. This guarantees I get the product and saves me $40,000 compared to Alice's offer."
