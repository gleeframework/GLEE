"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high initially to establish a strong bargaining position. Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will inform our strategy for subsequent rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the safety net of John's offer ($800,000). This allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). While his counter-offer indicates interest, accepting it would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and will aim for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $850,000 keeps us above our minimum acceptable price and provides room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Time Consideration:** We are still in the early rounds of negotiation. This offer attempts to find a middle ground quickly but with room to adjust in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle on $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below our minimum acceptable price. While $775,000 is a tempting offer, we have the leverage to push for a better deal. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about our valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $825,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** We are making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) to signal that we are nearing our bottom line.  
* **Justification:** Framing the price in terms of ""true value"" reinforces our position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we approach the halfway point in the negotiation, applying subtle time pressure by highlighting our desire for a mutually beneficial solution can be advantageous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to move a little higher to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees us a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
