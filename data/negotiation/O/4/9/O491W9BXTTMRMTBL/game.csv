"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a fair price considering my needs. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
