"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a fair price considering my needs. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer of $11,500 is still significantly below John's standing offer of $12,000.  At this point, it's more profitable to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
