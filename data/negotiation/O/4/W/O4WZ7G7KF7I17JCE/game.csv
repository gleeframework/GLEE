"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. I understand that you think it's worth $1400000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than $1600000. How about we meet at $1680000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1680000 again, but I'm not budging any further. I think that's the best we can do without going below my minimum price. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1680000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $1700000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, so think carefully before responding.",1700000.0,Alice,9,
