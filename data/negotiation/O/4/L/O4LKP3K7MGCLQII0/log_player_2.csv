"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7500. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $7,500 is a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept your counteroffer, but it's worth a shot."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm looking to pay closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could potentially negotiate further, accepting the offer at $7,250 saves you $750 compared to buying from John. This is a good compromise considering the limited rounds and the risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate further."
