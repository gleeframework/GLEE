"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,3,
