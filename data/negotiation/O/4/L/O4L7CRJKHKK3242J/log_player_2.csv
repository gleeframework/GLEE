(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget. This will immediately show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. If she rejects this, it's a signal that she's aiming for a much higher price, and I might as well go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my budget. It's a middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice, especially considering her previous offer of $17,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. It's only round 5, and there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $13,000. This shows Alice that I'm still interested and willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a fair compromise, especially considering her previous offer of $14,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has lowered her price again, I'm still hoping to get it lower. It's only round 7, and I have a few more rounds to try and get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get Alice to come down further. I'm also keeping in mind that John is always an option if I can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $13,000 and Alice's latest offer of $14,000. It's a reasonable middle ground, and I'm hoping that Alice will see it as a fair price. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to find a price that both of us can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 9th round and it's clear that Alice is not going to budge much further. It's likely that this is her final offer, and accepting it will still save me $625 compared to buying from John. I'm willing to accept a slightly higher price than my ideal, but this is still a good deal and secures me the product."
