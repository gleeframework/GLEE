"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  It's a fair price that considers its value to both of us."",

}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still a significant amount above John's price. Let's counteroffer again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to split the difference between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to drop to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's the best I can offer at this point.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now only $50,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees the best price and ends the negotiation process."
