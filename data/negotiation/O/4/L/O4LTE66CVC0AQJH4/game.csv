"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do see value in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1200000. I understand that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering $1300000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly.",1300000.0,Bob,4,,
