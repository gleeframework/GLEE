Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While continued negotiation might yield a slightly higher price from Bob, his offers are decreasing significantly each round. It's unlikely he'll meet a price point that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer provides a sure profit and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations falling through."
