"Hello Alice, I appreciate the uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given it some thought and am willing to increase my offer to $750000. I hope this is within the range you're considering.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. While $750000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1050000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I respect your final offer, Alice, but I'm unable to meet it. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is my last offer before considering an alternative seller.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your reluctance to meet my previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm unable to meet it. Given the time constraints and the fact that I'm close to reaching my maximum budget, I will proceed to purchase the product from John for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
