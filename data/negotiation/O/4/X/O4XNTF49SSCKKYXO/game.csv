"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value of similar products, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique features and benefits of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that takes into account the market value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, considering the market value and the unique features you mentioned. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns about the budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
