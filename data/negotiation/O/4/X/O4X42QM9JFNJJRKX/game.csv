"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $800,000 is significantly below what I consider to be a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm compensated for its true value.  I propose a price of $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
