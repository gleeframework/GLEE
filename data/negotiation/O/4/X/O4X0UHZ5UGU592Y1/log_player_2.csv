Alice's offer:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:**  $83 is significantly less than your $100 maximum and a reasonable compromise from your initial offers.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. If you counter again and she rejects it, you'll have to buy from John for $100."
