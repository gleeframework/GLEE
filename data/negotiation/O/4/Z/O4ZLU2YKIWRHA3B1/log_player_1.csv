Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $100 leaves no money on the table if Bob accepts.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While Bob's perceived value is $80, he might be willing to pay more due to factors like convenience, perceived scarcity, or a strong desire for the product.  It's always worth testing the higher price point first."
