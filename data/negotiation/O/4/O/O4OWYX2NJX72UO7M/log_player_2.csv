Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $170 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110? I think that's a fair offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about $140? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go below $140.  At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $120, your maximum budget."
