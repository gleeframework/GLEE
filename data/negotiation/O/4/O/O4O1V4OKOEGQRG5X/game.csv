"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves you a good margin for profit. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
