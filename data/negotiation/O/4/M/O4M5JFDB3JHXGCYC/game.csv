"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is quite high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be completely transparent, my absolute upper limit is $1,200,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
