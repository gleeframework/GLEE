Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I believe you'll find this to be a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd be happy selling to John at $120, there's an opportunity to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing you to potentially earn even closer to your maximum.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning a ""limited time,"" you add a touch of urgency that might nudge Bob towards accepting.

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
