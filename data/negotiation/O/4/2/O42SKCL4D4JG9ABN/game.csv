,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $115. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you at $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in making this deal happen.",105.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $112. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to meet you at $108. That's the last offer I can make, and I hope we can make a deal at this price.",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $108 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer you the product for $110. It's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've reached my limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm still interested in buying the product, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $100. That's the final offer I can make.",100.0,Bob,10,
