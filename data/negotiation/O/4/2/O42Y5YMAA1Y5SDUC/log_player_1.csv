Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $13,500, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher number. While Bob knows his value is lower, this starting point might make him more amenable to a price closer to $12,000 than if you started at, say, $12,500.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussing the price (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $12,000, securing a deal with Bob above that price means maximizing your profit. This offer aims to find that balance between aspiration and realism."
