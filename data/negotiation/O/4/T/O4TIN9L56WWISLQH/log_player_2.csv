"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, there's room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$110 is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $150. It's a reasonable compromise from Alice's previous offer and Bob is likely to save more money by accepting than by continuing to negotiate."
