Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price but still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while also showing I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, I can likely get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
