"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal work for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which I believe still reflects the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
