"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm using a high starting point to gauge his interest.  If he's seriously interested, he'll likely counter with a lower offer, giving us a chance to negotiate.  If he rejects outright, I can always fall back to John's guaranteed $15,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a good profit.  $18,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm dropping my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that's more than John's offer. $16,000 feels like a fair compromise considering Bob's last offer. This shows I'm flexible but still want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to go that far down from my minimum price.  I'm also running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
