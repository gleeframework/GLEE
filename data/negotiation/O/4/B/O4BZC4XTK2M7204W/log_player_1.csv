Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offers, and I would like to propose $132 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $132 is still slightly below my minimum, I've been negotiating for a while now and it seems like Bob won't go any higher. I'm also running out of rounds, and selling to John for $150 is a safer option. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing both buyers."
