"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $115 is close, but I can't go that low.  My final offer is $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's time to make a decision.",120.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $120. How about $117.50?,117.5,Bob,6,
