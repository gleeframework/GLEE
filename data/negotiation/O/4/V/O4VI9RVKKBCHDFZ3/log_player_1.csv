Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is a high starting point, it allows a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John without losing money."
