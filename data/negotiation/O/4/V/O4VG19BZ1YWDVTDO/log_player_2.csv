{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  There are many rounds left, so you have time to see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $50,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, and hopefully motivates her to come down a bit more in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to my target price, I still have time to negotiate and see if I can get her to come down further.  There's a chance I can get a better price than $725,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $710,000.  This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  Hopefully, she'll accept this offer, but if not, I'm still in a good position to continue negotiating."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $720,000. This is a good price, and I'm starting to run out of time. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  I'm going to accept Alice's offer."
