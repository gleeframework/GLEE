Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price. Since I have a backup buyer in John, I'm not willing to go lower. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my absolute minimum price right now. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my minimum than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't give in easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too far below my minimum, even considering the potential for future counteroffers. At this point, the risk of further negotiation and potential for a lower price isn't worth it. Selling to John guarantees my minimum and minimizes risk."
