"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for this. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
