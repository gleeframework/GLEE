"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation before reaching John's price. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be significantly lower than Alice's initial offer:**  This shows we're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Still be above Alice's value of the product:**  Offering $10,500 ensures Alice would still make a profit if she accepts. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** We're still a ways away from our $15,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more to me than that. Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved down a bit, $13,000 is still too close to our fallback option of buying from John.  We should counter again, but be prepared to potentially walk away soon if she doesn't budge enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I could go up to $11,000, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** We're increasing our offer, but making it clear we're also reaching our upper limit.
* **Still below John's price:** We're still negotiating for a price that's a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Sets a firm tone:** By stating ""$11,000 is really my limit"", we're signaling that Alice needs to move closer to our price if she wants to make a deal."
