"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer means paying $14,000, which is less than the $15,000 you would pay John.  Even though you value the product at $15,000,  it's still a good deal to save $1,000."
