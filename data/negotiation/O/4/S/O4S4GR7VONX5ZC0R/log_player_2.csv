"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While its market value is significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Please let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
