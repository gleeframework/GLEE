"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  Alice's starting price is closer to your limit than her value, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to establish a lower starting point for the negotiation. By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for compromise, I'm hoping to reach a price closer to her $8,000 value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $8,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to her actual value, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can get a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm still very interested, how about we meet in the middle at $8,250?"",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

This counter-offer aims to split the difference between her latest offer and my previous one.  It shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $8,500 is out of the question, but I can do $8,375. That's my final offer, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting this offer gets you the product for significantly less than John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
