,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $5,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can agree on this.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $7,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about we split the difference at $7,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,
