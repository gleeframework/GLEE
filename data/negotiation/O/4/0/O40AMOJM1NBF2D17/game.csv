"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential value, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1000000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the significant value this product can bring you, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
