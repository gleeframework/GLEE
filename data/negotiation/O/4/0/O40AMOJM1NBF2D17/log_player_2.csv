"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $1200000. I believe its value to you could be substantial, and I'm confident this price reflects its potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. There's a chance Alice is willing to negotiate, especially since she mentioned the product's potential value to you. By rejecting the offer, you can start a negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.  This shows you're serious about negotiating and signals that you're not simply trying to haggle a few dollars.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This leaves room for potential negotiation.  Alice may counter with a price closer to $1,100,000, allowing for a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Avoiding Immediate ""John"" Decision:**  By making a counteroffer, you avoid automatically buying from John. This allows you to explore if a better deal can be made with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1000000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the significant value this product can bring you, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  While $1,100,000 is still higher than your initial counteroffer, it's within a reasonable range and represents a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price.  

Accepting the offer ensures you acquire the product without further negotiation and saves you $100,000 compared to John."
