{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, it's getting very close to the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal. John's offer is a safe and reliable option, and I can't afford to keep negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
