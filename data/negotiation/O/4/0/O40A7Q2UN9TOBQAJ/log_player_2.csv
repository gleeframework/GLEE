"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Given its value, I'm willing to offer you $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my maximum budget but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room:** By offering $1,300,000, I'm giving Alice some wiggle room while also showing that I'm serious about buying the product.
* **Negotiation message:** My message acknowledges her offer and explains my reasoning for the counteroffer, setting a positive tone for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand its value, $1300000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1400000 is the lowest I can go. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $1,400,000 is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again and try to narrow the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,400,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current one. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing the importance of finding a compromise and reaching an agreement. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to move closer to her price, but still pushing for a lower number."
