"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
