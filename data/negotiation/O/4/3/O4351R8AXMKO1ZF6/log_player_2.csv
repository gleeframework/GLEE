It is better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.

It's worth trying to negotiate a bit lower with Alice. $9,000 is still above your desired price point, and you could potentially get it for less with a bit more haggling."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $8,750? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference at $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $8,875 is closer to your desired price, it's still slightly higher than your maximum budget. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's more advantageous to go with that option and save yourself $875."
