I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. While I could accept and be done with it, I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,350,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer.  If he still rejects, I'll need to reconsider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $50,000 more than what John would pay, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd like to keep negotiating, I'm going to accept this offer.  I can't guarantee that Bob will continue to raise his price, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal entirely."
