"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $7,500, it's a good deal. However, Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $7,000?  I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's less than the $8,000 value to Bob, and getting closer to his counteroffer of $7,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
