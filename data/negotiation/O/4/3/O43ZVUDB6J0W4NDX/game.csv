"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to consider that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go as low as $85, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $90.  Let's meet at $92.50 and call it a deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you at $91.25, but that's as low as I can go. Can you do that?",91.25,Bob,6,
