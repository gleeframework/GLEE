"Alice, your product is enticing, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
