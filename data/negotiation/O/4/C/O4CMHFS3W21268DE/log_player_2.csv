"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. We should aim for a lower price, especially since we have 9 more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're aiming to get the price down significantly.  A counteroffer of $10,000 is a bold move, but it demonstrates our commitment to getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
