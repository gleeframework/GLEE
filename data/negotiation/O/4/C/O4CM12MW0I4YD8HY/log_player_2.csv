# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you a great product that I believe you will find valuable. I'm asking for $119.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay a maximum of $120.
* Alice is offering the product for $119.
* While this is slightly better than John's price, it's still above your maximum. 
* You can get the product for $120 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to minimize your spending."
