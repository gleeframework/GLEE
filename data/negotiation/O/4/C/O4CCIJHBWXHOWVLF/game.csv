"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $10500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $9500 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the higher end of the price range. How about we try $11000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $10000, and I've already offered $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000, so I'll offer $9500 again. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can do $10250 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not ready to give up on the higher end of the price range. I can do $10500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made several counteroffers, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll pay $9750 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,10,
