Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting would mean a substantial loss. While there's a gap between our valuations, I think there's room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $15,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $14,000?
