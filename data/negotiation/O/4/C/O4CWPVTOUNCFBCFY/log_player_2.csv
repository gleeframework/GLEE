Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true worth and is a fair offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and call it $14,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500, and it's getting risky to push further. You can get the product for a guaranteed $12,000 from John, which is a better outcome than potentially overpaying in later rounds."
