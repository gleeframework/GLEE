Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows for maximizing profit. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 positions it attractively:
    * Bob gets it for $150,000 less than his valuation.
    * I secure a $350,000 profit above my minimum.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** The initial offer leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate if he desires, without immediately dropping to John's price.

This approach balances risk and reward by aiming high but remaining realistic within the established value framework."
