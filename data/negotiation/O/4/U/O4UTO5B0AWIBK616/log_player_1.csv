Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $100, and still higher than my minimum of $100. It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
