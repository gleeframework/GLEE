"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm starting with a price of $120, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $102.50 is slightly above my minimum value of $100.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the limited time and the possibility of John buying the product.  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and guarantees a profit."
