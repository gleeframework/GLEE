"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is a decent price, there's a chance to get it for less. Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price, getting you closer to your $8,000 target.  You can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer if needed."
