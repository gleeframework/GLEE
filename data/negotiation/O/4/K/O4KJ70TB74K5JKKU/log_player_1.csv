"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be happy with the deal."

I'm going to counter with $9,750. It's a smaller step than before, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my ideal price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob,  he's not budging on his price.  It's getting too close to my minimum, and the risk of reaching a stalemate is high. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell to John."
