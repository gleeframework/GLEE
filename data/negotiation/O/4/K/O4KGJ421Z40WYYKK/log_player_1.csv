Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $150, we don't want to scare him away with a price that's too far above that.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing we have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives us leverage. If Bob rejects this offer, we don't lose out.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer reasonable enough to accept."
