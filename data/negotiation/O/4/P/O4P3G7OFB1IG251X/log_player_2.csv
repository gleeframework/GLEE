"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You know you can buy the product from John for the same price, so there's no immediate benefit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a strong opening move. This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating and hopefully encourages her to consider a lower price.  It also gives you room to compromise in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and gives you a chance to make a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice lowered her price by $100,000, it's reasonable to increase your offer by a similar amount. This shows you are willing to compromise and are getting closer to a mutually acceptable price. The new offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial price, giving her room to negotiate while also being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, there's still potential for further negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to try and get a better deal.  It's possible to still get a price lower than $1,075,000 and save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! Alice has come down $25,000 from her last offer.  I'm increasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount, $10,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but also that I'm still aiming to save as much money as possible. The hope is that Alice will accept this offer and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer by $5,000, showing she is willing to compromise.  While it is still not your ideal price,  this is a fair compromise, saving you $130,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly better price, and continuing to reject offers risks losing the deal altogether.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
