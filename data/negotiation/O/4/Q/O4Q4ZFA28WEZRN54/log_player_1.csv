Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now in round 8, and Bob is still not willing to meet my price. I am running out of time and negotiations are not progressing quickly.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell to him for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking losing the deal altogether with Bob and ending up with nothing."
