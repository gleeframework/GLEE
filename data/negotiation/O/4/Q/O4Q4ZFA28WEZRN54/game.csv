"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your initial offer was $1,200,000 and you're now offering $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. Considering your initial offer was $1,200,000 and you're now offering $1,075,000, I'd like to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,025,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, again, with a final offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close this deal.  If we don't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to move forward with another potential buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
