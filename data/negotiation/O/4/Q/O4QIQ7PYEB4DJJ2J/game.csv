"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is appealing, I'm aiming for a figure closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe that's a fair compromise, considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm eager to finalize the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
