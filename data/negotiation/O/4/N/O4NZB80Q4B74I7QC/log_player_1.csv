"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate down while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer will help me gauge Bob's interest level and negotiation style.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price without revealing the exact worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). I believe there's room for negotiation to secure a higher price. I'm willing to risk rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, considering its potential return on investment.  I could consider parting with it for $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 920000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price ($950,000 to $920,000) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's inherent value and potential, subtly reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial offer.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $920,000, I'm aiming to set a new anchor point for the negotiation, moving closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving towards my desired price point, but his offer of $880,000 is still below my target. It seems he's willing to negotiate further.  I'll continue the negotiation in hopes of securing a better deal, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and prompt Bob to make a decision. 
* **Small Concession:**  I'm only reducing my price by $20,000 to signal that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This price point represents a near-perfect compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's current offer and my previous counteroffer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I want to leave some room for potential final adjustments if Bob rejects this offer. However, I also want to avoid getting too close to my fallback option of $800,000 with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $890,000 is very close to my last offer and significantly higher than my fallback option of $800,000 from John. 
* **Finality:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob altogether and having to settle for the lower price from John. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
