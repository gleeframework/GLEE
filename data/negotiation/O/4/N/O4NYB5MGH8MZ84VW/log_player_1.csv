Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to go up to $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the earlier discussions.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are now at a respectable $1,350,000. Accepting ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer by pushing too hard."
