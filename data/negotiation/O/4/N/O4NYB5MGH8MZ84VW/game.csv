"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. ",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your offer, the inherent value of this product goes beyond $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,500,000? It's a win-win situation for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm happy to go up to $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the earlier discussions.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
