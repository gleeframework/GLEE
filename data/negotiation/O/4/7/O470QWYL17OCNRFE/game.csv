"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little more than I can spend right now. I'm willing to go to $8,250. It's a fair price that's close to your last offer, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
