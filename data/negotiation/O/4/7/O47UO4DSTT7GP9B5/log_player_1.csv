Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value, which might make Bob more amenable to the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, suggesting Alice is willing to negotiate if Bob finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing a sale with Bob."
