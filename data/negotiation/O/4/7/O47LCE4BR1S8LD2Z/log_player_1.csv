``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still securing a profit for you.  It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the value for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, you can still potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to inch closer to your target price.  Selling to John right now would secure a higher price, but it's worth exploring whether you can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial situation, I can't commit to $1,075,000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,060,000. This amount allows me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a fair return for your product. I hope we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of further rejection and losing the deal entirely is high.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids potential delays and uncertainties."
