Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential benefit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, there is still room to negotiate a higher price within his range.

This strategy allows you to potentially maximize your profits while keeping the negotiation open."
