"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,000 is still a bit out of my range though.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $16,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $17,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",17500.0,Alice,5,
