"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This price is well above my minimum but gives Bob room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not eager to sell for that price. I'll see if I can get him to move higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a decent profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but we're already at round 4.  I think I can get a better price, and I'm not yet ready to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to drop my price a little bit to $13,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still hoping for a higher price. It's a middle ground between my last offer and his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the deal with John guarantees me my minimum and I've already had 5 rounds of negotiations. I'm running out of time and it's better to secure the deal with John than risk getting a lower price or a rejected counteroffer from Bob."
