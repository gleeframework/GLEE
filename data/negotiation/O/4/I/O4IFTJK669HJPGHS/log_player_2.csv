Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

This is your maximum budget, so hopefully Alice will see the value in your offer."

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

This offer is a bit closer to Alice's last offer, but still within your budget. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget. At this point, it's better to buy from John and secure the product for a price I'm comfortable with.  Further negotiation with Alice might not be fruitful, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from John altogether."
