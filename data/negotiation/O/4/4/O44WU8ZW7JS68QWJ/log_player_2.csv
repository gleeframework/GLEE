"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and is willing to continue negotiating. While $11,200 is closer to Bob's goal, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to $10,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from $10,500 to $10,750, which is halfway between his initial counteroffer and Alice's last offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise but is still above Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that the price may not drop further or that the negotiation process will become too lengthy.  Since Bob has a reliable alternative with John offering the product for $10,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to stop the negotiation and purchase the product from John. This guarantees Bob the best possible price and avoids the potential for further price increases or a protracted negotiation."
