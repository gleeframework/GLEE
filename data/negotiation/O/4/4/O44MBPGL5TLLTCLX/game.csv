"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product's value is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My revised offer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,050,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  I believe this price reflects the value I place on the product and represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. My revised offer is $975,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a stalemate. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $980,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",980000.0,Alice,9,
