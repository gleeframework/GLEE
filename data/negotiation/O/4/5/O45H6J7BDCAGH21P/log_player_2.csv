"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a product that's worth $1000000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice."
