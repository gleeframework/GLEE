"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a steal for a product this good!",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still a little more than I'm willing to spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $140.  That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
