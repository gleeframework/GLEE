{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets the stage for further discussion, keeping the door open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and am interested in purchasing it, however, my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me and the price John is offering. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's much closer to my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely. It's a good compromise that allows me to get a fair deal while still closing the sale."
