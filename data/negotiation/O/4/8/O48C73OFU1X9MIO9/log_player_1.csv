Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a good business decision for my company. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
