"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to me than that, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a good business decision for my company. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal for your company, and I respect that. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,050,000. This gives us both a significant opportunity to benefit from this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above our initial midpoint. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to make one final offer before I consider other options. How about $1,000,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's close this deal and move on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Can we meet at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I understand you're working within your budget, but $980,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is a very fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to explore other options.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $990,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $990,000, so I'll offer $985,000. Can we agree on this price?",985000.0,Bob,8,
