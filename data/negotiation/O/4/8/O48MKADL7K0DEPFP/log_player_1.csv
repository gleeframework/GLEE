"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable.  I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to build rapport with Bob.
* **Reasonable Offer:** While $9,500 is higher than Bob's valuation, it's not so high that it seems unrealistic or unreasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and well below my initial offer of $9,500. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **Time to counter:** I'm not ready to give up yet. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This product is really valuable, and I believe it will be worth the investment for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It's also higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm still holding out for a good price.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to persuade him to pay a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiations, using language like ""find a middle ground."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time to counter again:**  I'm not ready to sell at such a low price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiating space:** I believe there's still some room for negotiation to find a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,125? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise further.
* **Fair compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it sound appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm still highlighting the value of the product, hoping to reinforce the idea that it's worth a slightly higher price.
* **Direct and clear:**  I'm using direct language and asking for a clear answer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $8,125 is still a touch high for me. Would you consider $7,900?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiating space:** While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time to counter again:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push for a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **Limited rounds left:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to make sure I'm not settling for a price that's too low, but I also need to be mindful of the possibility that we might not reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $7,900 is a good offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This is a really great product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm again offering to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing continued willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to convince him it's worth a slightly higher price.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting ""let's close this deal!"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Final offer?** This could potentially be my final offer before considering John's offer, but I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
