"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. It's already a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Alice,5,
