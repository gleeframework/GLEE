Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. It's already a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and it's a better deal than buying from John.  $132 is a reasonable compromise."
