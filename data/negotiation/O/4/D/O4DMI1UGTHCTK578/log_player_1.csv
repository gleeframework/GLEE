Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Bob is definitely getting closer to a reasonable price, but I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. I need to hold firm and see if I can nudge him a bit higher in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to compromise further, but I still think $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is clearly committed to staying around the $1,300,000 mark. Accepting his offer of $1,350,000 is a solid win. It's a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially stalling."
