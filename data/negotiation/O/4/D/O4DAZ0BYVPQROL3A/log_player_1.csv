Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $900,000 price point allows for a reasonable compromise without forcing me to accept a price drastically lower than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product, not just the price. This can help keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Waiting for Bob's Response:**  This allows me to see how Bob reacts and whether he's willing to engage in a back-and-forth. If he immediately rejects, I can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining My Ground:**  I'm not giving in completely. $875,000 is still closer to my desired price range, ensuring I don't sell too far below my minimum.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented Tone:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties. This can help maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere and potentially encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too far below my desired price point. 
* **Risk of Further Lower Offers:**  Continuing to negotiate risks lowering the price even further, potentially forcing me to accept an offer I'm not comfortable with. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John provides me with a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's latest offer and meets my minimum requirements. 

**Final Decision:**

* The potential for further downward pressure on the price and the certainty of a higher offer from John make it more beneficial to sell to John."
