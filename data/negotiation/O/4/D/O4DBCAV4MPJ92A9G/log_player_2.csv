"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's valued at $1500000 to you, and I'm sure it would be a great asset for your business. My initial offer is $1400000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to discussing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to you ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You have room to negotiate a lower price and save money. 
* **Counteroffering allows for potential savings:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,250,000 on this product.  It's a significant investment for me and this price would be a good starting point for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1250000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1350000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,350,000 is significantly lower than John's price and still within your acceptable range.
* **Negotiation has yielded savings:** You've successfully negotiated a lower price from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting the offer minimizes negotiation time and effort."
