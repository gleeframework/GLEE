Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly a substantial sum, this product's value is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth while acknowledging your eagerness to acquire it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,350,000 is a good offer, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price from Bob. We're not in a desperate situation to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's find a middle ground: How about $1,380,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,380,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is a strong price, and we're getting into the later rounds. While we could push for more, there's a risk Bob's offers will start to decrease, and we'd lose the opportunity to make a good profit. Accepting now secures a substantial gain."
