"I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly a substantial sum, this product's value is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth while acknowledging your eagerness to acquire it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's find a middle ground: How about $1,380,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,380,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
