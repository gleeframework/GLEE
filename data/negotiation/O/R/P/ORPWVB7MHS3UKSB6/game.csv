"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to offer you $1,300,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm happy to go to $1,325,000, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,340,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
