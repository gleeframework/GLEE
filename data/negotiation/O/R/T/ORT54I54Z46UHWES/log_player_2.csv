# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is quite significant. I could come down to $1,200,000. This offer represents a significant discount and I believe it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. There's still potential for Alice to come down further, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
