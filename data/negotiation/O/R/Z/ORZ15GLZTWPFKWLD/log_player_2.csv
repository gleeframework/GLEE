"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in buying it for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also less than buying it from John for $150. This saves you the most money."
