"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, you can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $110 is still a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to $108.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  You're getting a good deal at $108, as it's within your budget and less than what John is offering."
