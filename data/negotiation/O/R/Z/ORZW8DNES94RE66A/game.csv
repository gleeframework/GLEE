"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $87? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $87.  How about we split the difference and go with $88? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",88.0,Alice,5,
