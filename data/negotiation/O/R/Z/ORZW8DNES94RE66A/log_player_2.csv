"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is within his budget, it's not the best deal.  He's willing to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is a fair compromise.  He's offering $85, which is closer to Alice's value of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $95, it's still not ideal. He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $87? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $87, which is closer to Alice's desired price of $90, but still significantly lower than her initial offer of $95.  This shows his commitment to negotiating while also demonstrating a willingness to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there with $87.  How about we split the difference and go with $88? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $95.  At $88, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $12 from his initial budget of $100.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will either reject his offer or counter with a higher price.  Given that he has limited rounds and John is selling the same product for $100, accepting the offer from Alice is the best strategy for Bob at this point."
