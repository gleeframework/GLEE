Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible while ensuring a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $925,000 offer leaves some room for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer).
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a strong alternative buyer (John) at $800,000, providing a good fallback position.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while mitigating the risk of losing the sale entirely."
