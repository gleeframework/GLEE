"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price, especially since we have plenty of rounds and the option to buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to a more reasonable price, $975,000 is still significantly higher than her value. We have time to negotiate further and try to get closer to the $850,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $975,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still a bit under my initial target, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to our desired price, but we still have room to negotiate. We're getting into the later rounds, so we should start inching our offer upwards, but we can still try for a better deal than $925,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is getting closer to what I had in mind, Alice. How about we settle at $910,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 910000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $910,000. I can meet you at $920,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $920,000 is a reasonable price. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and we're running out of rounds to negotiate further.  Accepting now secures a good deal for us."
