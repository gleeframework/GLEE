"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $95, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is $95.
* I want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm sure we can reach a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves some room for profit, but also reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. 
* While $90 is better than $95, I can still try to get a lower price by counteroffering. 
* I'm not yet at a point where buying from John for $100 is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
