"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $95, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm sure we can reach a fair price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves some room for profit, but also reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
