Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into coming down in price. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $960,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is close to my minimum acceptable amount and it's better than the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
