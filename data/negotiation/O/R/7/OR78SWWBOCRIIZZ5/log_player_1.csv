Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to make sure he understands the value of this product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$500,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for such a drastic reduction.  I need to see if Bob is willing to come up closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident this product is worth $900,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if he doesn't come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm coming down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe this product is worth it.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm not willing to go lower than $800,000. It's time to sell to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
