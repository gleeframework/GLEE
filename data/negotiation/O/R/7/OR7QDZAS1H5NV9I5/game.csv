"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? This gives you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair return.  Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1100000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's bridge the gap at $1250000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll be happy with the product's value at that price. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
