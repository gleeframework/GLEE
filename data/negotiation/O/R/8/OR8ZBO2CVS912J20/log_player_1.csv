I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, he'll see the value in this price and accept it."

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, as it's the best option available to me."
