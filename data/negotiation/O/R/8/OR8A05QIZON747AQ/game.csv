"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000. Let's make this happen, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and still represents a good value for you. Let's close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I think this is the lowest price I can offer and still make it worth my while to sell the product to you. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. I'm willing to make one last concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,
