"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. The product seems like a great value, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This reflects the product's worth while still giving you a fair price.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my target price. I'd like to try to get closer to my initial target of $9,500. How about we meet at $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
