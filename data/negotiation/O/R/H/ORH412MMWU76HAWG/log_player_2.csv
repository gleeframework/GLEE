"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the most logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 
 
This is a significant counteroffer, but it's still within your budget and might encourage Alice to negotiate.  We'll see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a good price, we're still within the negotiation phase and can try for a lower price. Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows you're serious about buying but still willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, and we've already used 4 rounds of negotiation.  It's a good price, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate might just lead to more rejections and waste valuable time.  It's time to secure the deal at a reasonable price."
