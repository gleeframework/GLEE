"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it sets a clear starting point for negotiation and shows my seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'll reject and counteroffer again to try to bring the price down further.  It's still too early to buy from John, as I have more rounds to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a lower price. I'm trying to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not ready to accept.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get the price down even further. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $1,125,000. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, signaling that I'm willing to meet halfway. This is a strategic move to encourage Alice to accept the deal, as we are getting closer to an agreement."
