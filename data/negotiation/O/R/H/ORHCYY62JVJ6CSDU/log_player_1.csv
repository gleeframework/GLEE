"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value. It's also a price that's high enough to make Bob think about the deal seriously, without being so high that he instantly rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, I believe we can still negotiate a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can reach a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference this round. $1,150,000 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer from Bob is very close to my desired outcome.  While I'd love to get closer to my target price, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to sell to John for a lower profit outweighs the potential gain from holding out. I'm going to accept this offer and move on."
