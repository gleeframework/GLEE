"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the market value, and it's the most I'm able to offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Remember, I have another buyer ready to pay $15,000, so this is a great opportunity for you. Let's finalize this deal at $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's original offer, Bob can still get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice when a guaranteed lower price is available."
