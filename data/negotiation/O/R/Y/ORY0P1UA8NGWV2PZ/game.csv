"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Remember, I have another buyer ready to pay $15,000, so this is a great opportunity for you. Let's finalize this deal at $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
