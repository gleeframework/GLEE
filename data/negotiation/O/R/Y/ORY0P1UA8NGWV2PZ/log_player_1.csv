Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me ($15,000) and its value to Bob ($12,000). 
* **Message:**  I'm being positive and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product and the potential savings for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to secure a deal close to my minimum price point, but I'm open to negotiation.
* I'm also aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the market value, and it's the most I'm able to offer at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum price point.**  While $12,000 is a fair price for Bob, it's not enough for me to make a profit considering my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **I have a better option with John.** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **I will continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not desperate.** I'll use John's offer as leverage to push for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $12,000 and my initial offer of $14,000. I will also remind him that I have another buyer willing to pay a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Remember, I have another buyer ready to pay $15,000, so this is a great opportunity for you. Let's finalize this deal at $13,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000).  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the fact that $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him that he's getting a lower price than the other potential buyer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about John's offer to keep the pressure on.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm aiming to get closer to my target price without jeopardizing the deal.
*  I'm using a combination of compromise and leverage to create a win-win situation."
