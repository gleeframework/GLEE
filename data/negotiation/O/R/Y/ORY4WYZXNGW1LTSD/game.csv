"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
