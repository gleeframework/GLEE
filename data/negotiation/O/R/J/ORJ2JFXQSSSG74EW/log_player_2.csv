Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also have to make sure I get a fair price for something that's worth significantly more to me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,112,500? This price gives us both a solid return on our investment and allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,093,750 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.
