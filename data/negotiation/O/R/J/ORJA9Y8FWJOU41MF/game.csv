"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway. However, $9,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a significant concession on my end, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  I want to be fair to you, but I also have to consider my own value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 was my previous best offer, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
