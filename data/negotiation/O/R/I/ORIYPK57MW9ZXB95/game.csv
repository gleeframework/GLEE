Thanks for the offer Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $70?,70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $70 might be pushing it a little. How about $78? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me. $78 is still a bit low.  How about $82? It's only $4 more than your last offer, and I think we can both be happy with that.",82.0,Alice,5,
