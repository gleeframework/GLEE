Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer of $70. While it's better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $78. It's getting closer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me. $78 is still a bit low.  How about $82? It's only $4 more than your last offer, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 82}
