"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than $120 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. That's my maximum budget.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway? I'll propose a price of $140 for the product. I hope this works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $120. It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous discussions, I think a fair price for the product would be $135. This is a reasonable increase from your last offer and still below my initial asking price. I hope this proposal works for you, Bob.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $135 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference - $130. It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal.",130.0,Bob,6,
