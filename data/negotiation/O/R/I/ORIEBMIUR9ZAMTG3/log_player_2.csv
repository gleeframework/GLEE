"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be extremely valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $20,000 is significantly above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob should attempt to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $10,000 provides leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating his serious intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $12,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget but leaves room for potential compromises and is a fair price considering Alice values the product at $15,000.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone while clearly stating Bob's position and the reasons behind the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Alice moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for compromise. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Bob should keep this offer in mind as leverage for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $10,000 while still acknowledging the value of the product for Alice.  He could try something like:

* **""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my reach. How about we settle at $14,000? This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit while staying within my budget.""**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still beyond what I can afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? This allows you a good profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** Bob continues to push for a lower price, showing his determination to reach an agreement.
* **Compromise:**  The offer of $14,000 is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and Bob's previous counteroffer.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes that the proposed price benefits both parties, highlighting the fair profit for Alice and the affordability for Bob."
