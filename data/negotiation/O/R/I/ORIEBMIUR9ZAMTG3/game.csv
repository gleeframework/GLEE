"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $17,000 is still beyond what I can afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? This allows you a good profit while staying within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
