"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it is more than my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation and  still allows me to potentially get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95?  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer $95,  $92 is a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could result in a lower price or even a deal falling through."
