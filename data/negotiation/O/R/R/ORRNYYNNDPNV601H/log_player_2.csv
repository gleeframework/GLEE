"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your maximum:** You're willing to pay $10,000.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500. 
* **John's price:** $10,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, you can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to potentially lower her price or risk losing the sale altogether. It's a strategic move to try and get a better deal."
