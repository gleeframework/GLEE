"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! As we've discussed, it's a high-quality item worth $15,000 to me. I'm willing to make a fair offer to you, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
