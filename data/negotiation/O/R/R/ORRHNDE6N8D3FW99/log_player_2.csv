"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! As we've discussed, it's a high-quality item worth $15,000 to me. I'm willing to make a fair offer to you, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000, but it's closer to his maximum budget than his previous offer.  By accepting the offer, Bob saves $500 compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering the product's value to Alice."
