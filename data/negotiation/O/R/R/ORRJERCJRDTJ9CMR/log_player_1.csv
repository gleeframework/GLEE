Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it feel more palatable.  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies it might be gone soon, adding a bit of pressure.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and asks ""What do you think?"", subtly inviting Bob to counter-offer if he's not immediately sold. 

While there's a chance Bob will reject $175 outright, it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit. You can always negotiate down to $150 if needed, ensuring you don't lose out on the sale entirely."
