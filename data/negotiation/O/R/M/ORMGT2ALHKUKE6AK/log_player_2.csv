"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can likely get a better price from Alice. It's worth trying a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000 for this product. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $12,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise, and it's still within your budget. There's a chance you could get her to lower the price further, but it's not worth the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John for a higher price."
