Considering its unique features and the benefits it can bring to you, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this item at an exceptional price. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $950,000. This offer allows you to save $250,000 compared to its perceived value, making it a highly attractive deal. I am confident that you will find this investment worthwhile. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's price, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I'm looking for a better deal and increase the chances of her coming down further in price."
