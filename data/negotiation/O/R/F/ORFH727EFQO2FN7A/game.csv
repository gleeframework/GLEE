"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. ",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high.  How about we agree on $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
