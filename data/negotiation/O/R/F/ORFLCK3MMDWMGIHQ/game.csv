"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500? This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I believe this price reflects its worth.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,500 is still above my budget.  I'm serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's make this simpler: $13,000, and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
