Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly pressures Bob to act quickly.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While aiming high, $1,150,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower, more ""fair"" price could be strategic."
