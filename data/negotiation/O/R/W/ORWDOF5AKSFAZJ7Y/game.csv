"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a million dollars to you for a slight premium. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value it holds for you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $1,000,000. Would you consider selling it for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. I'm prepared to sell for $980,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you place on this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",980000.0,Alice,3,
