"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth exactly that to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at the exact same price, there's no incentive to buy from Alice.  Bob can get the product for the same price from John."
