"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Could you do $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is below my minimum, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $13,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13000 is still above my budget. As I mentioned before, I'm comfortable at $10000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm really interested in getting it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $10,000, which is below my minimum.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe and secure option that meets my minimum price requirement."
