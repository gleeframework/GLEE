"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's a [briefly describe the product's main benefit] and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. We don't know enough about the product yet. Rejecting the offer allows us to explore potential discounts or make a counteroffer that's more in line with our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Could you do $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $13000? It's still a great deal for a product with [reiterate the product's main benefit], and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still too high. We've already established that we're willing to pay $10,000, so we should stick with that counteroffer. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further price drops."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still above my budget. As I mentioned before, I'm comfortable at $10,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm really interested in getting it, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
