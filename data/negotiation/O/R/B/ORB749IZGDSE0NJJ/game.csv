"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $90. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $90 is closer, but still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $85. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings.",85.0,Alice,5,
