Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to Bob's perceived value of the product.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000, so there's no risk in asking for a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair price and is willing to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll have to decide if I'm willing to keep negotiating or if I'm better off taking the $10,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value, and I'm confident that he's unlikely to offer much more. It's time to accept his offer and secure a sale for $12,500."
