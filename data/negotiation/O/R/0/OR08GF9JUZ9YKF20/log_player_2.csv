"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a competitive price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price, and it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's a compromise we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $10,500 is a good deal for him, as it's lower than what he'd pay John and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. There's no guarantee he can get a lower price in the next round, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further."
