"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than what John is offering. It's a good deal considering the potential to save time and effort."
