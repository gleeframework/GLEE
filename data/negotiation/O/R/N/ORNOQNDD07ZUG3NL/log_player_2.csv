"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product from John for $120, so you can do better than $110.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

You are still better off buying from John for $120 if Alice won't go lower than $105. You can try to get her lower in the next round."
