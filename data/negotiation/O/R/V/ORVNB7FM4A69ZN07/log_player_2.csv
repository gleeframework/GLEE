"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  Unfortunately, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Justification:** While we don't need to give a specific reason, mentioning the price is ""a little too high"" implies we're open to a deal but need it to be more budget-friendly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still above John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** By suggesting $95, we're signaling a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Simple and Direct:**  Keeping the negotiation straightforward can be effective.
* **Maintaining Friendliness:**  We continue the positive tone to encourage a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:** While not ideal, $105 is only $5 more than the midpoint between our initial offer and her initial price.
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the rounds. While we could push further, there's a risk Alice won't budge much more. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and potential to lose the deal.  $15 saved may not be worth the risk, especially as we have a guarantee at $120."
