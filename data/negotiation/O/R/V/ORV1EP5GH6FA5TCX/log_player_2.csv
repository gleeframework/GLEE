"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll be impressed once you learn more about it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  It's unlikely he'll get a better deal than $1,500,000 from John, so buying from John is not a good option yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, recognizing its value and your willingness to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to be flexible. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've already invested in our conversation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to go lower. It's unlikely that he can get a better deal from John than $1,500,000, so buying from John is still not a good option at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. Considering our previous discussions and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $812,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, $812,500 is still too high. He has some negotiating room left and should continue trying to get a better deal.  It's still unlikely that he can get a better deal from John, so buying from John is not a good option yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $812,500 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $780,000, which reflects the value of the product and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 780000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $795,000 is a good price for him, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get a better deal. He has already made several counteroffers, and it's possible Alice will not be willing to go lower.  Also, considering the number of rounds remaining, he should accept the offer to secure the purchase."
