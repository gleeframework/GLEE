Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,000,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, suggesting I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob shows interest.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
