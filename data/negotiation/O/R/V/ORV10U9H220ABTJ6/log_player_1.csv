"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that establishes a high baseline.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're getting close to my minimum, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000. It's a good deal for both of us."
