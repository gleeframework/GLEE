{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price point, it's still $10 cheaper than buying from John. 
* **You value the product:** You're willing to spend up to $150, so paying $140 is a reasonable compromise."
