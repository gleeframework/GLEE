"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my starting point.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price, you can potentially get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $11,000. Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully, we can close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to your desired price. However, you can still potentially get a better deal.  You are only $500 away from your target price of $10,500, so it is worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get Alice to drop a little further."
