"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $725,000, which is closer to your offer. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $662,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",662500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $662,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $700,000. How about we split the difference again and settle at $681,250? This is a fair price that balances our needs, and lets us move forward with the deal.",681250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $681,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $685,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",685000.0,Alice,7,
