"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
