Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a somewhat reasonable deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a significant return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting closer to your minimum but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** You're highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence can make Bob more likely to agree.

**Important Note:** Bob might try to negotiate the price down. Be prepared to consider a counter-offer, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
