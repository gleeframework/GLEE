"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a significant return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above your limit.  While it might be a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
