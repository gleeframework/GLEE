"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for $12,000, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $11,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go at this point.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is now at $11,000 which is better than John's offer of $12,000. It's a good deal for you, so accepting is the best option."
