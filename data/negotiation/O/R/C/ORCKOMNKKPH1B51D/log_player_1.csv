Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a price significantly above my minimum ($100). 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my asking price and his perceived value of the product.  While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would leave a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between his offer ($90) and my previous offer ($115). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Above Minimum, Below Bob's Value:**  This price point ensures I make a profit above my minimum ($100) and is still an attractive deal for Bob, as it's below his perceived value ($120). 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that John is still an option, but I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is a bit low. How about $100?  That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 now matches my minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting the $100 ensures a sure profit and avoids the potential of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
