"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice, as her initial offer of $115 is still above my ideal price and what I know John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. I'm aiming to stay well below her initial offer and closer to her product's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  I'll reject this offer, but my next counter will be closer to her price to signal I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 is a bit low. How about $100?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm coming up to her product's known value. This offer is a good balance between trying to save and potentially closing the deal quickly."
