"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but this product is worth significantly more. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
