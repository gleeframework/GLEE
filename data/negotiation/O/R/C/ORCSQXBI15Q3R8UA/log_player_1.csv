{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving me room to negotiate. The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the discussion.  It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I won't accept a price that's significantly below its worth. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but this product is worth significantly more. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better offer and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
