"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider it?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it a great value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1600000. Can you consider it?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a great value. If not, I'm happy to consider other offers.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
