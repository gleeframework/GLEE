"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to move forward with the sale.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750? That's a significant step towards your price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making a real effort to find common ground.  While $9,750 is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers?  Would you be willing to sell for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
