"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $135. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit.  I hope this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
