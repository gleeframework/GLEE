"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $1,100,000 as a fair price for the product, given its value to you and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward towards a satisfactory agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a significant step towards meeting your needs while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I understand the financial constraints you're working under. Considering your latest offer, I'm prepared to accept $1,087,500 as the final price for the product. This amount reflects the value it holds for you while allowing us to close the deal. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and we can finalize the transaction.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,087,500 is getting close, but I'm still a bit over my target.  I'm confident that we can finalize this transaction if we agree on $1,080,000. This price would be a good compromise for both of us and help us avoid any further negotiations. ",1080000.0,Bob,6,
