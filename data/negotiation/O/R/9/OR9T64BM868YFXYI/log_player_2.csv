"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a price that reflects both its worth and your investment. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for Bob. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider $1,100,000 as a fair price for the product, given its value to you and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal allows us to move forward towards a satisfactory agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price to see if he can get closer to his goal of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of getting a better deal."

Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price again. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop a little further to secure the deal.  If she rejects again, Bob can consider buying from John as the difference in price is not significant."
