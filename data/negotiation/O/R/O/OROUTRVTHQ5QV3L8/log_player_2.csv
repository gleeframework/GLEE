Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the best I can do at this point. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $1,400,000. I'm confident the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to hold firm on this price. What's your next move?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm sensing some resistance on your end.  While I value the product, $1,400,000 is pushing my absolute limit. To be completely transparent, I can get this for $1,500,000 from another seller.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you've got other options, but I'm not willing to let this deal slip away. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, which is still below the product's true value to you. I'm confident we can make this work. What's your next move? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,400,000. She keeps emphasizing the ""true value"" even though you've been clear about your budget. It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking getting stuck with a worse deal. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is the safer option at this point."
