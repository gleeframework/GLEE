"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my initial budget.  To show my seriousness, I'm willing to offer $800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I must consider the value I've attached to it, and I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
