"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $150,000 difference between my asking price and Bob's perceived value allows for a potential compromise we can both be happy with.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate, accepting this would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by countering and leveraging the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the value you're getting while still being a fair deal for me."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:** I'm holding my ground by rejecting Bob's low offer and reiterating my product's value.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting $1,050,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also signaling that I won't settle for significantly less than my initial offer.  
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, the firm but fair tone implies I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is increasing in very small increments. At this pace, we're unlikely to reach a price that works for me within a reasonable number of rounds.  I need to signal that I'm serious about my price floor and that John is a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your counteroffer doesn't reflect the significant value this product offers.  I have other interested buyers, but I believe in being straightforward and giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,025,000.  This is a firm price, and I need a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm serious about walking away if he doesn't meet my price.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've lowered my price slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm still well above his current offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm explicitly mentioning other buyers to increase the perceived value and opportunity cost for Bob.
* **Clear Deadline:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a quick decision to keep the pressure on and avoid drawn-out negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he won't budge beyond $990,000. This is still considerably below my minimum, and further negotiation seems unlikely to close that gap. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll significantly increase his offer, and I risk missing out on John's guaranteed purchase."
