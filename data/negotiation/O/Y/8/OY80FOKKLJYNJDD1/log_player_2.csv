{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  $120, which is too high for your budget.
* **John's Offer:** $150, which is your maximum limit, but not ideal.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $120 is still too high.
* **John's Offer:**  $150 is your maximum limit, but you want to avoid it if possible.
* **Strategy:**  Start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $105 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation. This shows you are serious about buying but also willing to bargain."

* **John's Offer:**  $150 is your maximum limit, but you want to avoid it if possible.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $125 is still above your desired price point.
* **John's Offer:**  $150 is still your maximum limit, but you want to avoid it if possible.
* **Strategy:**  Increase your counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  $115 is a good compromise, showing you're willing to move closer to her price but still holding firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible, but you also want to buy the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $130 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your limit. 
* **John's Offer:** $150 is your absolute maximum, and Alice's offer is significantly lower.
* **Strategy:**  Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate. Accepting her offer will save you $20 compared to buying from John. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers and risk ending up with John's higher price."
