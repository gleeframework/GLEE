"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we've discussed, this product is worth $12,000 to you, but I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. Considering the value of this product and what I'm willing to pay, I'd be comfortable with a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I can go up to $11,000.  This offer represents a significant value for you while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
