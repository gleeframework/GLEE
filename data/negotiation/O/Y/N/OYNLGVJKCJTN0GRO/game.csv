"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be open to considering a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $8000, which would be $10000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
