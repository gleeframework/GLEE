"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm aiming to gauge his willingness to negotiate and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a substantial profit. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that's higher than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum and closer to what I'm hoping to get. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he'll counter with something lower.  Accepting his offer ensures a solid profit and avoids risking a deal falling through."
