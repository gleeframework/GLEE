"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for your business.",8500.0,Alice,5,
