"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,250? This reflects the value it holds for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $9,500, which I think is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
