"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which is $10,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I need to make a bit more than $9,750 to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
