Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price. Are you interested in purchasing it for $95?"", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($100) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures you get significantly more than your minimum ($80). 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about this alternative."
