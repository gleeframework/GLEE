Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a high offer, just below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

The negotiations with Bob have not resulted in a satisfactory price for me. Given that I have only a few rounds left, and John is willing to pay my minimum price, I will sell the product to John. This ensures I get the best possible value for my product."
