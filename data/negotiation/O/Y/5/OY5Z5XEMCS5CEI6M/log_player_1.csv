Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've seen its potential, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to earn as much as possible, and she knows John will pay the full $1,200,000.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than this for Bob to even consider it.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By calling it a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice aims to encourage Bob to accept quickly rather than overthink or try to lowball her. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is confident in John's guaranteed purchase at $1,200,000. If there's any risk that John might back out, Alice might need to adjust her offer to Bob to be more competitive."
