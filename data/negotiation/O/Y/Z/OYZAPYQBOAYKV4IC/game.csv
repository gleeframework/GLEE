"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,200. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,
