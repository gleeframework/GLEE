# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
