Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **The message:** This is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. It also subtly highlights the product's value without revealing too much.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Sets a high bar:** Starting high gives you more leverage throughout the negotiation.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** You can lower your price if Bob counteroffers, without immediately going down to your minimum.
* **Encourages engagement:** A positive, engaging message is more likely to get Bob to respond.

**Important note:**  This is just a starting point. Remember, your goal is to maximize your earnings, but you also need to consider the risk of losing the deal. If Bob is unlikely to pay anything near $15,000, it might be better to start with a slightly lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value. I want to try and get closer to my goal of maximizing profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is showing interest, so there's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  There's a risk that Bob might walk away if I reject his offer. However, the potential reward of a higher price outweighs this risk at this stage.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer, but potentially lower than my initial offer, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. $12,000 is definitely closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Price:** I've lowered my price from $15,000 to $13,500, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to a potential middle ground.
* **The Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my appreciation. I reiterate the product's value and offer a reasonable compromise, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Show Flexibility:** Lowering the price demonstrates willingness to negotiate and increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain Leverage:** $13,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum price, ensuring I don't sell myself short.
* **Keep Bob Engaged:** A positive and accommodating message encourages Bob to continue negotiating.

**Important Note:**  The success of this counteroffer depends on Bob's willingness to compromise. If he's firm on his $12,000 offer, I might need to adjust my strategy and consider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a bit more, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but considering the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Closing in on the minimum:** $12,800 is very close to my minimum price of $10,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** It's possible I could get a higher price if I keep negotiating, but there's also a chance Bob could walk away entirely.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and he walks away, I'm left with only John's offer of $10,000.  

**In summary:** It's better to secure a deal with Bob at $12,800 than to risk losing him and settling for John's lower offer."
