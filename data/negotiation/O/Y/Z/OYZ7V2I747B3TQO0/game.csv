"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. $12000 is definitely closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $13500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a bit more, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal.",12800.0,Bob,4,
