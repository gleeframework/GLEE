Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers, and I think $110 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll try to push for a bit more in the next round before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I really want to keep the price at or below $110. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to go above $105, which is still below my minimum value.  Rather than risk going through more rounds with a potential for even lower offers, I'm going to sell to John for $150, ensuring I get my desired value for the product."
