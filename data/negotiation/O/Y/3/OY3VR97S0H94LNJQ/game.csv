"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $120 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",115.0,Alice,5,
