"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1150000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1050000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to get closer to my minimum acceptable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1075000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1075000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1090000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This would allow me to get closer to my desired price, and you would still get a great deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
