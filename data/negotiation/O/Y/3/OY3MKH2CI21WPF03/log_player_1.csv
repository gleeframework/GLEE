"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,150,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if we can reach a compromise. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's mutually beneficial. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a last resort, as I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to get closer to my minimum acceptable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1075000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price below my minimum acceptable price yet. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more suitable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  This would allow me to get closer to my desired price, and you would still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
