Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me.  I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to create some negotiating room. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $9,000 is a decent starting point that allows for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my minimum desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone could help Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, or potentially reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000.  I will be prepared to accept a price in the $8,000-$9,000 range, but I'm not willing to go lower than $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to sell the product, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $9,000 to $8,500, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $8,500 is a fair price.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by using a phrase like ""find common ground.""

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal that's closer to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John at a slightly lower price.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a worse outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $8,000. This secures a good price and avoids further negotiation."
