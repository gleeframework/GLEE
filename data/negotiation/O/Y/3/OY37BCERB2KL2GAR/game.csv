"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to sell the product, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,000.
