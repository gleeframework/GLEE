"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a valuable product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part, but I do see the value in your product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This offer is closer to your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  It's a win-win situation!  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $775,000. That's a very strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",775000.0,Bob,6,
