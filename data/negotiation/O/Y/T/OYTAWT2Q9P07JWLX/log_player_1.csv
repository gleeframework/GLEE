"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can find a compromise, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part, but I do see the value in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This offer is closer to your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  It's a win-win situation!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $775,000. That's a very strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I've only got 4 rounds left. I don't want to risk being stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
