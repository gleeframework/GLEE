{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $110, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm using positive language to create a good impression and make Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm justifying the price by highlighting the product's value. 

I'm confident I can get a good price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your kind words. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  While $95 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm aiming to get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  While John is offering a guaranteed $100, I believe there's a chance I can get more from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $105. It's a fantastic product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Close to My Target:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my target of $100, but still slightly higher. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using open-ended language like ""What do you say?"" to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a compromise. 

I believe this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob while still allowing me to achieve a price close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my previous offer of $95. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on his $95 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $100.  We've reached a stalemate.
* **Guarantee:** John offers a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time & Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and might not result in a higher price.  

By selling to John, I'm ensuring that I get a fair price for the product without further delays or potential disagreements. It's a safe and efficient choice."
