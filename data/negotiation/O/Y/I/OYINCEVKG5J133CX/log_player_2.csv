"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good price but not the absolute best. Since you know John will sell it to you for $100, you can reject Alice's offer and still get the product for your maximum price."
