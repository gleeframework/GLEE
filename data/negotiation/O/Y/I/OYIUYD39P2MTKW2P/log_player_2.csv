"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's room for negotiation. I should counter-offer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. It's still a profitable price for Alice, and it would leave me with a good saving."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

Alice is negotiating, but I think there's still room to go lower. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to my initial counter-offer."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $9,750? That's a fair offer, and it would let me buy it from you today."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Alice's price, but still leaving some space for potential further negotiation. This keeps the pressure on Alice while demonstrating I am serious about the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

Alice has reached her minimum price, which is a good deal for me. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a better price, and going to John would mean paying more."
