Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to try and get closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose $1,400,000 as a compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting very close. It's important to keep the deal moving forward, and this price is still above my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard."
