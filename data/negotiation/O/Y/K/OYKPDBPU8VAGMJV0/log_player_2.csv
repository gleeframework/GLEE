"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd get great value out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable product at a good price, and me to earn a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **John's offer:** $10,000

Alice's offer is lower than John's, meaning you'll save $500 by accepting it.  Even though you might be able to negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer guarantees a saving compared to buying from John."
