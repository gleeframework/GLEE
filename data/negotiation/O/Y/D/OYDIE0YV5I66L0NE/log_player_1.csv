Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $95 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($100), giving him incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This gives you flexibility to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still try to push for a higher price. You have a good chance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is still a bit below what I initially hoped for, it's a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer of $80, and it avoids further negotiation.  It's likely that Bob won't go any higher, so accepting his offer is the best option."
