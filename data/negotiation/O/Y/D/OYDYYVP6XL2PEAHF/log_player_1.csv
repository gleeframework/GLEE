Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob ($850,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation with my message.
* **Reasonable justification:** I'm not just throwing out a random price. I'm trying to justify it by mentioning the product's value to Bob.

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to consider:

* **How strongly he wants the product:** Is he willing to pay a lot for it, or is he just testing the waters?
* **My time constraint:** Do I need to sell the product quickly, or can I afford to wait for a better offer? 
* **John's offer:** If I'm running out of time or I'm not getting a good price from Bob, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is clearly interested, he's starting low. I believe there's room to negotiate a price closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price between $700,000 and my initial offer of $850,000. I'll try to gauge how strongly Bob wants the product and adjust my offer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $750,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not shutting down the negotiation. I'm proposing a compromise price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing that it's still a good deal for Bob and it gets me closer to my goal.
* **Focus on win-win:** I'm framing the negotiation as finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind my minimum price and the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $750,000. How about we meet at $725,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe there is still room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target.  I'll continue to be flexible and try to understand Bob's motivations for not wanting to go higher.  If I sense we're nearing an impasse, I will consider selling to John, but I'm not ready to do so yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Would you be willing to go up to $740,000? It's just a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 740000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm only asking for a small increase to show flexibility and demonstrate a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Solution:**  I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach by saying ""Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.""
* **Motivational Language:** I'm using phrases like ""get us closer to a deal"" to keep the conversation positive and focused on reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects again, I'll likely move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $740,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $725,000, so how about we try $732,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $732,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $732,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob has remained firm in his price, and while his latest offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.
* **Time Constraint:**  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and I'm concerned that further negotiations might drag on without a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $800,000 is now more appealing as it guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirements.

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the negotiation has become unproductive.  Selling to John ensures a quick and secure transaction that meets my financial goals."
