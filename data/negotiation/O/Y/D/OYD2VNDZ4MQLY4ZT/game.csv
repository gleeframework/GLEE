"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  This would be a good starting point for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation.  To be frank, $975,000 is quite close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your flexibility.  However,  I'm still hoping to reach an agreement closer to $975,000. Would you be willing to consider $985,000? This is the very best I can do, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",985000.0,Bob,6,
