,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $90? It's still a fair deal for both of us and gives me a bit more room to make this sale work.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  $87.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",88.5,Alice,5,
