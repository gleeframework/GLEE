You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  $120 is still above your target price of $150."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as 105. How about we meet in the middle at 115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.

You are still able to get a better deal than $115. Keep negotiating!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as 110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at 112? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:

While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the price is now at $112. This is a decent deal for you, as you can save $38 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the most logical decision at this point."
