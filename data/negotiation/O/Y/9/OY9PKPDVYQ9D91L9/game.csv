"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as 105. How about we meet in the middle at 115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as 110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at 112? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",112.0,Alice,5,
