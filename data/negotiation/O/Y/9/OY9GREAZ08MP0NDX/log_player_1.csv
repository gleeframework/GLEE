{""product_price"": 140}

This offer is a compromise between your minimum acceptable price of $150 and Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $100. It gives you a good chance of selling the product to Bob, while still earning a decent profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
