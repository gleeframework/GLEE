"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I believe it will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something amazing.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe the product has some great features, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $820000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $820000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good investment. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $790000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's potential. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $790000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $760000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value and the market conditions.",760000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $780000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's potential. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $780000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780000 and $765000. I'm counteroffering at $772500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",772500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $772500 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $760000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value and the market conditions. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000.",760000.0,Bob,10,
