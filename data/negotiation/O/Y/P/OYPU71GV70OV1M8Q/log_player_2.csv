"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $500,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with an offer that heavily favors me (Bob). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Justification:**  The message provides a brief reason for the low counteroffer without revealing my absolute maximum budget.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains polite and open to further discussion, indicating I'm serious about purchasing the product if a suitable price can be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,900,000 is considerably more than my $800,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice reducing her price suggests she's willing to negotiate. I need to keep pushing towards a more reasonable price. 
* **John is an Option:** I'm still willing to walk away and buy from John if needed. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,900,000 is still quite far from what I had in mind. I could go up to $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** By increasing the offer to $700,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to move closer to Alice's price range. 
* **Nearing the Limit:**  This counteroffer is getting close to my $800,000 maximum. It signals that I'm serious but also reaching my upper limit.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Highlighting ""fairness"" aims to nudge Alice towards a more agreeable position, suggesting this price is a win-win situation. 
* **Deadline Implied:** While not explicitly stated,  the tone suggests a sense of urgency.  Alice might be more inclined to accept knowing I have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is closer to a fair price, there's still a significant gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer - I have another buyer ready at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has presented this as her best price, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Over Budget:**  $1,500,000 is significantly above my $800,000 maximum.
* **John is Reliable:** I have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with.

While Alice's product might be slightly more desirable, the price difference is too substantial. It's more advantageous for me to secure the product from John at a price that aligns with my budget."
