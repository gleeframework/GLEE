"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,900,000 is still quite far from what I had in mind. I could go up to $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is closer to a fair price, there's still a significant gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer - I have another buyer ready at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
