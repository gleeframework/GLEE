"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me, and $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  It's closer to your offer, and we'd both be getting a good deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
