Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing you closer to your $150 goal.
* **Balancing Profit and Likelihood of Sale:** While you could aim for a price closer to $150, a slightly lower price increases the chance Bob finds it acceptable, avoiding the need to sell to John."
