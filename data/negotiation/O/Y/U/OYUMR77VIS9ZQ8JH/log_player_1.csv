Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth at least $100.  Would you be interested in buying it for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also includes a statement about the product's value, which may make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but how about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $80. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to Bob and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  I'm sure you'll find this a good deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $86.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price, $86 is a good deal and above my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the sale to Bob and having to settle for John's lower offer."
