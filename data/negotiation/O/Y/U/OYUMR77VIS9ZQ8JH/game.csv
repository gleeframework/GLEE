"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but how about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  I'm sure you'll find this a good deal.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $86.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,
