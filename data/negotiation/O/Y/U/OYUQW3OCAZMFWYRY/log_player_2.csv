"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal range. There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is closer to his target, there's still some room for negotiation. He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?  That would be a significant savings for me, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to get the product. Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $13,250 is a good deal for Bob, as it's still within his budget and below the price John is selling for. There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up paying more, or even losing the opportunity to buy from Alice.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most rational choice in this situation."
