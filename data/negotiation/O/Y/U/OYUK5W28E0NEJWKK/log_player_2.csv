""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $120 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  Let me know what you think."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go down to $70, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $80, but I'll throw in some extras that will make it worth your while. Let me know if this is a deal you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for you! Alice is offering the product for your maximum price and even throwing in extras. There's no guarantee you'd be able to get a better price from her, and John offers no extras."
