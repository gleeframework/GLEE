Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $100 is higher than your minimum, but lower than Bob's maximum, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** It's not a take-it-or-leave-it price, opening the door for Bob to counter.
* **Provides context:**  ""I think would be very valuable to you""  hints at the product's worth to Bob, subtly increasing his desire to purchase. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $80, and it's likely that Bob will not come down further. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
