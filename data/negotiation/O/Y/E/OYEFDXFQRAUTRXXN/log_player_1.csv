""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a significant discount from my initial offer, which might make Bob perceive it as a good deal. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from potentially reconsidering or finding alternatives. 

This offer balances securing a sale with trying to get the highest possible price from Bob."
