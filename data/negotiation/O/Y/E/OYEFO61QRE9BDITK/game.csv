"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $140 is getting closer, but I need to get at least $160 for it to be worth my while.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,5,
