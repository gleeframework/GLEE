The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That would give us a good deal and allow us to finalize this transaction. Let me know what you think.

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $9,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $8,000."
