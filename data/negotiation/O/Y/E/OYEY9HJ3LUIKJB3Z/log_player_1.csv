Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation. While there's a chance Bob might reject it outright, there's also a chance he'll counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as reflecting the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the higher cost.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation involves understanding the other party and adjusting your approach accordingly.  You could also consider a more aggressive opening offer if you believe Bob is highly motivated to buy."
