"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for you and your business. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $1,300,000 for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,150,000. This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above $1,050,000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
