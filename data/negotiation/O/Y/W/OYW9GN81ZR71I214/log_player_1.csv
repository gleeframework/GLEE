"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. My asking price is $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation, as this will make Bob more likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $80?  This would still give you a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
