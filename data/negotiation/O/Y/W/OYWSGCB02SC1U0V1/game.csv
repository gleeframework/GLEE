,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,250 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go down to $9,750.  Let's close this deal!",9750.0,Alice,5,
