{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $160 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll offer $150, which is my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum threshold, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's better to sell to Bob for $150 than to sell to John for the same price, as I prefer to maintain the possibility of future business with Bob."
