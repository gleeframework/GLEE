"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The price of $175 is not too far from Bob's perceived value of $100, making it a realistic starting point for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate:** I'm not ready to give up on a better price.  I'm prepared to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While John's offer of $150 is attractive, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I need to sell for. Let's split the difference. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that $125 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation polite and encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $95? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Time for a firm counteroffer:**  I've shown flexibility, but I need to be firm to ensure I get a fair price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John, giving me confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer waiting."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm using the ""final offer"" tactic and mentioning another buyer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining politeness:**  I'm still being polite and respectful, even though I'm taking a firmer stance."
