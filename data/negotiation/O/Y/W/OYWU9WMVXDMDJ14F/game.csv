,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I need to sell for. Let's split the difference. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $95? That's a reasonable compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer waiting.",110.0,Alice,5,
