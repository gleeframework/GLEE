Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I want to maximize my profits. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a good return for me.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the true market value (implied to be higher) adds pressure on Bob and makes the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate within reason. 
* **Backup plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $1050000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), it's still not a satisfactory deal. I can likely do better. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the luxury of rejecting this offer and trying to push for a higher price. 
* **Room for counteroffers:** I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,080,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate while staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I highlight the value of the product and that the price is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm remaining friendly and encouraging a deal to be made, while showing I'm not desperate. 
* **Still above minimum:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's, but still gives me a decent profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for further negotiation if Bob still wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet your asking price. I am willing to pay $1070000 for your product. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not good enough:**  While Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might lower his offer further, making a deal even less profitable. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, providing a secure and substantial profit.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could prolong the process and potentially lead to a less desirable outcome.

It's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed profit with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
