Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  I've had other interested parties and I need to see a price that reflects the true potential here. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This would still be a great deal for you in the long run.

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,100,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, but we're still a bit apart. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.
