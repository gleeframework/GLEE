"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer ($1,150,000) that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than our minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite but firm, gauging Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** We are aware of John's standing offer ($1,000,000), giving us a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is above our minimum, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate, and with 8 rounds remaining, there's no immediate need to settle for an offer that's $75,000 below our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm confident this product offers even greater value. How about we settle at $1,120,000? This represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of this unique opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a concession by decreasing our price, but not drastically. We moved down $30,000, signaling we're willing to negotiate but still aiming high.
* **Justification:** We're justifying the price by re-emphasizing the product's value and positioning the offer as a ""fair compromise."" 
* **Continued Negotiation:**  We are encouraging continued dialogue, hoping Bob will move closer to our desired range.  We'll re-evaluate our position if he remains firm in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating more aggressively now, but we still have leverage.  

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's concessions are getting smaller.  He only moved $25,000 this round. 
* **Above Minimum:** We're still comfortably above our absolute minimum ($1,000,000) and have time to negotiate.
* **Strategic Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're serious about getting a price closer to our target. 

We will need to adjust our counteroffer strategy in the next round to keep Bob engaged while aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,100,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the product's inherent value."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Tone:** We're adopting a more collaborative and understanding tone to keep the negotiation positive and avoid a stalemate.
* **Significant Concession:**  We're making a larger concession this round ($20,000) to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong psychological price point. It's a round number and a significant step towards Bob's latest offer.
* **Time Consideration:** With half the rounds remaining, we need to start moving towards a close. This offer balances our desired profit with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob is sticking to his pattern of halving the difference, and his offer is getting dangerously close to our absolute minimum.

* **Unacceptable Offer:** $1,025,000 is only $25,000 above our fallback option with John.  
* **Limited Time:**  We have 4 rounds left, and Bob is unlikely to drastically change his negotiating style. 
* **Calculated Risk:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Bob walking away, but it also sends a strong message that we're not desperate.

We need to change the dynamic in the next round to either close the deal quickly or walk away to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but it seems we're at an impasse. I need you to be serious about this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not ready to move forward at that price, I need to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimatum Time:** We're laying down the line. Bob needs to understand this is his last chance. 
* **Justification:** We're reminding him that we've been compromising, but we won't go below our limit.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,075,000 is our previous offer minus Bob's typical counter. This gives him a small win if he accepts but ensures we're above our absolute minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** We're explicitly mentioning ""other options"" (John) as leverage.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  We get a decent deal.
* **Bob Counters:** We likely walk away and sell to John, as his counter is unlikely to be acceptable.
* **Bob Walks:** We sell to John, getting our minimum but avoiding further time investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,025,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he won't budge beyond $1,025,000. 

* **Not Worth the Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob offers minimal upside ($25,000). There's a real chance he walks away in the next round, leaving us with nothing.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging this out further costs us time we could be using to pursue other opportunities.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's the smart business decision at this point.

While not ideal, accepting John's offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential for a worse outcome with Bob."
