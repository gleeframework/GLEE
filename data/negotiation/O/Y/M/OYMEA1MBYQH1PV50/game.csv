"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering Alice, but that's still a bit too much for my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer it to you for $140, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",140.0,Alice,5,
