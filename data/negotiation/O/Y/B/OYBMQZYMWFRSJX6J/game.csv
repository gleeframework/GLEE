"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, recognizing its value to me.  This offer reflects my budget while still providing a healthy profit for you.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
