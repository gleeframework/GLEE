**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal.  You know John is willing to sell for your target price, so you have a fallback option."

Alice has come down a bit, but the price is still above my target of $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my target price before I commit.  John is waiting in the wings with a good price, so I have the flexibility to walk away if this doesn't work out."
