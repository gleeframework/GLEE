Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10750.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. I'm prepared to offer $10,600 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate further, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to your target. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $10,700 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and her price is getting closer to Bob's desired range.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price.

Accepting the offer secures a good deal without risking the deal falling through."
