"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A high initial offer sets the bar for the negotiation and allows for more room to bargain.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value for Bob, aiming to pique his interest.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, while still maintaining a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of Product:** My product is worth at least $800,000 to me. Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Space:** Bob's offer is well below my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for negotiation. There's room to find a middle ground.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have several rounds left to negotiate.  It's worthwhile to explore a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $500,000 is a bit low for the value this product offers, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still maintaining a substantial profit.
* **Justification:** I'm explaining my counteroffer by tying it to the value the product provides for Bob.
* **Call to Action:** I'm prompting Bob to consider my offer and suggesting the possibility of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose $600000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** We are getting closer to a potential deal, and I still have rounds left to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $800,000 is tempting, I want to maximize my profit if possible. There's still potential for a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints.  $600,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit low for the value this product holds. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm continuing to lower my price, demonstrating flexibility. This keeps Bob engaged and shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my offer. This emphasizes the potential benefit he'll gain.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  I'm using language that suggests a finality to my offer. This can create pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose $650000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's getting closer, it's not enough to justify selling at this point.
* **Rounds Remaining:** I have several rounds left to negotiate.  I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to reach a higher price with Bob.  However, his offer provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $675,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget. I'm confident that you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  
* **Finality and Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""meet you halfway"" and ""let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and positioning the price as a worthwhile investment for Bob."
