Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to secure the sale with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a win-win situation if Bob understands the true value. He saves $500, and Alice makes a quicker sale at a price higher than her guaranteed offer from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interest, Alice subtly encourages Bob to act quickly without seeming pushy."
