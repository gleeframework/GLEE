# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. I propose to sell the product to you for $9,500. This price not only ensures a fair profit for me but also represents a significant saving for you compared to its market value. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You should reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or try to find another seller."
