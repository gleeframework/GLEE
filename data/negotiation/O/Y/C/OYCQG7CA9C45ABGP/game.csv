"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see value in the product, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  It reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $1,200,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
