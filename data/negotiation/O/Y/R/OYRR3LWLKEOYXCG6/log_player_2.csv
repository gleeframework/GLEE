"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $130 is within your budget, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.

By rejecting the initial offer, you can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  Offering $110 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:**  The message highlights your interest in the product while making it clear you're serious about finding a price that works for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I see you're serious about the product. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from $130, $120 is still a bit more than you'd like to pay.
* **More room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left. You can try to lower the price further.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you continue to show that you're serious about negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility.  How about $115?  It's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual approach:**  Instead of jumping all the way to $110 again, a slight increase to $115 shows you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better deal.
* **Positive message:**  Reinforcing the ""fair compromise"" angle emphasizes your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for Alice to come down a few dollars more if she's willing, while still keeping you within your preferred price range."
