"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $9,500 is still a bit too high for you, so I'll meet you at $9,000. However, I'll also throw in a small bonus, a free accessory that's worth $500. So, the total value would be $9,500 to me, but you'd get it for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still unable to meet your asking price of $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm thinking $9,250 was a bit too high, so I'll meet you at $9,000, but without the bonus. I'll also throw in a 30-day warranty, which is worth a significant amount. So, the total value would be $9,000 to me, but you'd get it for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to meet us halfway. However, I'm still unable to agree on the $9,000 price point. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,10,
