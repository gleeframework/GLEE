I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but it gives me the potential to earn more. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, there's also a chance he values the product much higher and is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Profit:**  A higher price means a larger profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By starting high, I can potentially negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. 

If Bob rejects, I can still secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
