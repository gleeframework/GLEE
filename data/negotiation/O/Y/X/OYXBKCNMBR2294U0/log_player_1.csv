Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value, giving me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:**  By starting at $14,000, I have room to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still making a profit.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $15,000 provides a safety net and allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $12,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counter-offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good enough price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000.
* **Message:** I'm still being positive and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. I'm also emphasizing that this price is a ""great deal"" and that it's a fair compromise.
* **Strategy:** 
    * **Meeting in the middle:** This approach signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price point closer to my desired value.
    * **Maintaining leverage:** By refusing to accept Bob's initial offer and making a counter-offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary.

By offering $13,500, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us, while still earning a respectable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John. 

**Strategy:**

* **Avoiding further negotiation:** This offer is too close to Bob's initial perceived value, and continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price than I'm comfortable with. 
* **Secure a better deal:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's more advantageous to sell to him.
* **Time efficiency:**  Selling to John avoids further negotiations with Bob, saving time and effort.

It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize profit, and selling to John ensures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
