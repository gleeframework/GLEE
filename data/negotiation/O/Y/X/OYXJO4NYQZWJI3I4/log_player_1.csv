Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $100 is a fair starting point, considering my minimum value and Bob's potential willingness to pay something more than $80. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which allows for a more dynamic interaction and potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is below my minimum value of $120, and I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John as backup:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to sell it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not making a loss. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, as I want to maximize my profit. I'm leaving room for Bob to counter again, but making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum value of $120. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk that we'll keep going back and forth without reaching a satisfactory price.
* **John's offer is better:**  John is offering $120, which is my minimum and guarantees that I don't lose money.
* **Time is money:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take time, and I don't want to risk losing the chance to sell to John for a higher price. 

It's a tough call, but in this situation, selling to John for $120 is the most sensible choice. It guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
