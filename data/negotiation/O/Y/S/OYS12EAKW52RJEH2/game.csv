"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm happy to accept $14,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $13,500, which is a fair compromise and a step closer to where we both need to be.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $13,750 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",13750.0,Alice,7,
