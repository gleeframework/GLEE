"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $13,500, which is a fair compromise and a step closer to where we both need to be."", ""product_price"": 13500}
