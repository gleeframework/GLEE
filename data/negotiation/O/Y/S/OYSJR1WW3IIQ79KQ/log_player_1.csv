Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than the $12,000 Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $14,000 is below your minimum of $15,000, so you are still making a profit.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:** It shows that you're willing to negotiate, but also that you value your product. 

By leaving some room for negotiation, you open the possibility for a successful transaction while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum price of $15,000. Selling to John for $15,000 is a better option at this point. 

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This keeps the negotiation open. There's a chance Bob will increase his offer, and you might be able to get closer to your target price.
* **Counteroffering:** You'll likely want to counter with a price closer to your target, leaving less room for further negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you retain the option to secure a better price or sell to John, maximizing your earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price reflects the product's true value and still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer slightly higher:** This shows you are willing to negotiate but also not willing to accept a price significantly lower than your minimum.
* **Reasoning provided:**  Explaining your rationale helps Bob understand why you are asking for this price. 
* **Emphasis on value:** This helps Bob see the product's worth and encourages him to accept. 

This counteroffer is a good middle ground that still leaves room for negotiation, while potentially securing a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,250 is closer to your minimum, it's still a considerable distance away. You're better off trying to squeeze out a bit more or selling to John. 

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Counteroffering:** You can aim for a price closer to your minimum or slightly above Bob's offer. 

You're in a strong position, knowing John is willing to pay your minimum price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and potentially get closer to your ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my minimum. Would you be willing to go up to $13,400?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13400} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer closer to your minimum:** This offer is a compromise that bridges the gap between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message focuses on a price that is ""fair"" for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're still open to further negotiation, but you're getting closer to your desired price.

This counteroffer is a strategic move that balances your desire for a higher price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to my maximum budget. I can go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is only $13,200.  While it's closer to your desired price than his previous offers, it's still significantly lower than your minimum of $15,000. 

Considering John is willing to pay your minimum price, it's in your best interest to sell to him. 

* **Selling to John:**  This guarantees you will receive your desired price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob. 

You've strategically engaged in negotiation with Bob, but ultimately, securing a higher price with John is the most beneficial outcome."
