"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price reflects the product's true value and still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my minimum. Would you be willing to go up to $13,400?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",13400.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to my maximum budget. I can go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",13200.0,Bob,6,
