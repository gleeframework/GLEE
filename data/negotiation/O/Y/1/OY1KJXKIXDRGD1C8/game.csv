"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 just doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle at $145.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Is this something you can agree to?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant at $145. I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Can you consider that?,135.0,Bob,6,
