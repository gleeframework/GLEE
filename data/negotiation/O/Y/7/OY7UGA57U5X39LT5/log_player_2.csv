"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm really interested in this product, so I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that it's within your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still potential for further negotiation.  Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm still very interested in this product.  However, $875,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $860,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is tempting, Bob is still within his negotiation range and could potentially get a better deal.  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and John is offering it for that price. There's still room to negotiate with Alice and try to get closer to that price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  I'm willing to pay $870,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to consider $885000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $885,000 is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Since John is offering the product for $800,000, it's more financially advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's not worth the risk of wasting more rounds and potentially ending up with a higher price."
