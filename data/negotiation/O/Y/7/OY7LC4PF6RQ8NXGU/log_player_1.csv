Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high and then be willing to come down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum value, and it's a better price than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer."
