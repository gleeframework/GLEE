Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit. The message is friendly and includes a reason to be interested in the product, hopefully making Bob more likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement at a lower price. How about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is close to my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price.  I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $140. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $140, and it's becoming clear that he won't budge much further. It's better to take the $140 now than risk losing him completely and having to settle with John for $100."
