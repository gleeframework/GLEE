"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still securing a good price.  I'm hoping Bob is interested and we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him up to $9,800 or so in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more. It's a risk, but I still have several rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $9,600.  I want to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price just yet. We're getting closer, and I believe this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping for a better price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not yet desperate to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $9,400.  This is a significant compromise, but it keeps me above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can finally finalize the deal. If he doesn't accept, I'll have to start considering the option of selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob. If he doesn't accept, I'll sell to John to secure at least my minimum price.  I'm willing to risk a bit more, hoping Bob will finally come around."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm dropping my price to $9,200, which is only $200 above my minimum.  I'm hoping this final offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'll have to sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept that I'm not going to get a better price from Bob. I'm only one round away from the end of the negotiation and I'm not confident Bob will increase his offer any further. While I'd like to earn more, selling to John for $8,000 is the most sensible option. I'll at least secure my minimum price and avoid risking losing any money."
