"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential room to lower the price if necessary. I'm also being positive and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $8,200, which is closer to my budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $8,200 is close to my minimum price and it's a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether, and John is always an option."
