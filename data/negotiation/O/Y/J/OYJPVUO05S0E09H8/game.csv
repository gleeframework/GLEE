"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,500. This reflects a significant discount and is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $7,250 is still below my desired price point.  How about we settle on $8,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product while still giving you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",8000.0,Alice,5,
