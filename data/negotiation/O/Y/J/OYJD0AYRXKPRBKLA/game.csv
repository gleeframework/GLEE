"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $11,000. How about $10,800? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, which is a good compromise. This way we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,600 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $10,700.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction.",10700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close, but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $10,650. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",10650.0,Bob,6,
