# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique qualities of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is still well within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $820,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering my previous offer. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $790000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your previous offers. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While I'd prefer to pay less, $790,000 is a good price considering the value of the product and my budget.  It's also significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I'd pay to John, making it a worthwhile deal. I'll accept the offer."
