"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique qualities of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $820000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a fair compromise considering my previous offer. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $790000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your previous offers.
