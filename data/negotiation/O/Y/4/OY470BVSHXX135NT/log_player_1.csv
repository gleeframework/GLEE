Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to try and find a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower and risk losing a significant amount of money. Selling to John guarantees me a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
