"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $12,500.
* This is a good deal, but you can do better. 
* You can get the product from John for $15,000, but you'd prefer to save money.  Since Alice is willing to sell it for $12,500, it's likely she will negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you are willing to pay less.  This will likely prompt her to lower her price to secure the sale."
