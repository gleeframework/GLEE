"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob while still keeping my profit margin.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.  I'm also reinforcing the value of the product to keep Bob motivated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to take the $85 offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to $100 or even $110, but I also need to be mindful that John is a guaranteed sale for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer the product for $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but I'm not willing to go too low. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to make my offer more appealing.  I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach a deal with Bob before I lose the opportunity to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above $95. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have some room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to $100. 

I'm also starting to get nervous about the time constraint. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm running the risk of losing the sale to John if I don't reach a deal soon. However, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're close to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $93. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm offering a price that's just slightly lower than Bob's last counteroffer. I'm trying to show him that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also making sure that I'm still getting a decent profit. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that we're close to a deal. I need to reach a deal soon before I lose the opportunity to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit below $93. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. 

It's getting very late in the negotiation, and I'm running out of time. Bob is not budging from his offer of $90, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm worried that I'll end up with nothing if I keep going back and forth with Bob. 

John is a guaranteed sale for $120, and that's a much better outcome than what I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.  I need to secure the sale before I lose the opportunity to sell to John."
