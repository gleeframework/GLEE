"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear less desperate to make a deal quickly.
* **Acknowledging Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing why he should be willing to pay a premium.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The language keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to engage, showing flexibility.

This offer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Acknowledgement:** While rejecting Bob's offer, the message maintains a positive tone and acknowledges his interest. 
* **Justification:**  Explaining that the offer undervalues the product emphasizes its worth.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:**  The counter-offer drops the price by a significant amount ($50,000) to show flexibility, but stays comfortably above Alice's minimum to ensure a good deal. 
* **Framing as ""Fair"":** Presenting the new price as a compromise and a fair deal encourages Bob to see it favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about $975,000?  This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the investment I'm prepared to make. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below your guaranteed sale price with John. You have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,060,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1060000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** The message starts by acknowledging progress and appreciating Bob's engagement.
* **Strategic Concession:** A drop of $40,000 is substantial and signals a willingness to make a deal.
* **Anchoring to Value:** The phrasing continues to emphasize the product's inherent value, justifying a price above Bob's offers. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, moving closer to John's offer implies that Alice has other options if a deal isn't reached soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  To meet you halfway, how about we settle at $1,020,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and our mutual desire to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Reserve Price:** Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, securing you a profit.
* **Strong Offer:**  Bob is clearly motivated and his offer is getting very close to your starting point, indicating a strong likelihood of a deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations further for a potentially small increase in price isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting now provides a good return with certainty."
