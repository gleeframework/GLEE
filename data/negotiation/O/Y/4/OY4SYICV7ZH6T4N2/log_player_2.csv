"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $170?

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."

Alice has matched John's price. There's no point in further negotiation or going to John, as you won't get a better price."
