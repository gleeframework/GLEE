Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a good starting point to see if he's truly interested. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and then decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or take John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell it for less than my floor. It seems like Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations, so it's time to cut my losses and take John's offer of $1,500,000."
