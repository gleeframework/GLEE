"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I think $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? How about $13,100?",13100.0,Bob,6,
