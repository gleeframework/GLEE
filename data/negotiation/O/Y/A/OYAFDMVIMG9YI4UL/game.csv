"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and the product's potential.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. It doesn't accurately reflect the value it brings. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the negotiations so far and the value I see in the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000.  This is my absolute final offer.  I believe it's more than fair, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. I'll meet you at $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,
