"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle from here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. Let's make a deal!",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly lower price.  Would you consider $1,060,000? It's a small step closer to my target, and I believe it's still a good price for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1060000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can do $1,070,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to consider other options. Let's make a deal!",1070000.0,Alice,9,
