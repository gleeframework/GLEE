Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. At this point, it's clear that we won't reach a price I'm comfortable with. Buying from John, even at $1,000,000, is the most sensible option to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
