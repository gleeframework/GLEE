I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable value.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still within my acceptable range and might convince Bob to close the deal."
