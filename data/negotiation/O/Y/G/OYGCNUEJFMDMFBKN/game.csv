I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's rarity and potential benefits. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price. I am willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1450000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1425000. Considering the product's unique features and benefits, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1475000. This is my final offer, and I hope it will meet your needs. If not, I'm prepared to explore other options.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
