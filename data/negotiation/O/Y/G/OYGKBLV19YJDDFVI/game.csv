"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its worth and the potential for significant return on investment. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for this product.  How about $950000? This would be a great price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $925000. Can we discuss further?",925000.0,Bob,4,
