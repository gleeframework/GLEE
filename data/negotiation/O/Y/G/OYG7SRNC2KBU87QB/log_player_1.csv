"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000. This gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, hopefully reaching a more agreeable price. 

**Important Note:** While I can sell to John for $12,000, I'm not rushing to do so. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product for you. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Staying Positive:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to reaching an agreement.

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping the option of selling to John in mind. This helps me to hold firm in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be honest, $10500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I'm still not there. 
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  I want to see how much further Bob is willing to go. I believe he might be willing to increase his offer slightly.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.

**Important Note:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is always a good fallback, but I'm optimistic that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $10,375. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm offering a price that's almost halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, highlighting the mutual benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer puts us within a relatively small price range, making it more likely Bob will agree.

**Important Note:** While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still mindful of the $12,000 option. This gives me confidence to hold firm if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $10250, but I need you to meet me at $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer again shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. It also keeps the negotiation open for me to try and get a better price.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly at his limit or if there's still room to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the best option. However, I'm still hoping for a better price from Bob, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you at $10,125. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement. Let's call it a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer. I'm making a small concession to show my willingness to close the deal, but I'm not going any lower.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement and creating a sense of urgency.
* **""Call it a deal!"":** This adds a bit of pressure and makes it more likely that Bob will accept the offer.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $12,000. I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9995, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,995. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,995
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,995 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Negotiating Power:** I've already made numerous compromises and counteroffers. It's unlikely Bob will budge further.
* **Protecting My Value:** Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I receive the minimum value I've set for my product.  

**Important Note:** While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's important to prioritize my own financial interests. Selling to John is the best way to ensure I get the price I deserve."
