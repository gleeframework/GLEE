Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Aiming slightly below this ($1,450,000) maximizes potential profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" seeks to justify the high price to Bob, even if its perceived worth to him is lower.
* **Urgency and exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique opportunity"" aim to incentivize Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more desirable. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** While this offer is a strong opening, Bob might counter-offer or reject it outright. Be prepared to negotiate or accept John's offer if needed. 
* **Relationship building:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust the offer slightly lower. This initial transaction could lead to more mutually beneficial deals in the future."
