"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is too high.  You have a clear goal of saving money, and there are still 9 rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, I'm looking to acquire it for a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate a more competitive price. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is still above your ideal price, but it's within your budget of $1,500,000 and only $50,000 more than your last offer.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better price, especially with only 7 rounds left.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product and save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
