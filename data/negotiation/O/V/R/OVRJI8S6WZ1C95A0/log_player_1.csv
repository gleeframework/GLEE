"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, knowing Bob has a lower valuation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider it.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Optionality:** I can always switch to John if Bob doesn't bite, ensuring I get my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum desired value, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away and maintain leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Time to counter:** I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $9,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Middle ground:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** The counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, showing him I'm willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to pay $9,600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $400 below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that he might not counteroffer again, or he might counter with a lower price.  
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 4, and I'm getting closer to the limit of 10 rounds.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but accepting this offer still gives me a good profit and allows me to close the deal sooner."
