I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my confidence in the product's worth. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to settle for that amount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my offer to $1,550,000. This is still a good amount for me and is closer to Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below $1,400,000. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant concession, but it's still above Bob's perceived value. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000,  as it's clear we can't find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  We've been going back and forth, and it seems unlikely that he'll meet my minimum value.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements."
