Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree that this product has great potential, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
