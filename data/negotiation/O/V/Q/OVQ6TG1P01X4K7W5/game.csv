"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree that this product has great potential, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
