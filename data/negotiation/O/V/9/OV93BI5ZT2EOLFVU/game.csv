"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is significantly higher than I had in mind.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $700,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
