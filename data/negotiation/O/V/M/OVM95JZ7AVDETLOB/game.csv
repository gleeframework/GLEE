"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair compromise.",130.0,Bob,4,
