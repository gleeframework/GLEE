"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a great starting point. However, I'm aiming to spend closer to $8,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is the best I can do for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price of $8,000.  Accepting her offer at $8,500 saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or John's price changing increases the longer you wait."
