"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a competitive price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $20000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is significantly below the value I'm placing on this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $17000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is my minimum.  This is a good price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. However, $15000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some wiggle room.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $13000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000.  This price offers us both a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of this product. Let's settle this deal and move forward.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your price and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",13500.0,Bob,8,
