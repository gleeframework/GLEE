,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $85, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested in this price, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Alice,5,
