"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer while also allowing me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to settle for Bob's offer of $85. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiations to try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $85, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested in this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 90}
