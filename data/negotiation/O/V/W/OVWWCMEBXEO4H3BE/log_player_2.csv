"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're looking for a price under $80, and $110 is too high. You have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your target, it's still above your $80 limit. You're in a better position to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $85, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested in this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $80.  Alice has indicated that $90 is her final offer, which is still above your target. You've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to more rounds of back and forth without a favorable outcome. It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid further delays."
