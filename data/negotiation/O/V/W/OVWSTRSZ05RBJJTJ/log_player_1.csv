"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. Let's compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $1,150,000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I value your persistence in negotiating. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,250,000. This price allows for both of us to find value in this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this has been a long negotiation, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. I'll accept $1,112,500.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,112,500 is still above my budget. I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $1,150,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere. I'll consider buying the product from John for $1,500,000 instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob is not willing to negotiate further. While his final offer is higher than John's, it's still below what I consider the product's worth. To avoid losing the sale completely, it's best to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
