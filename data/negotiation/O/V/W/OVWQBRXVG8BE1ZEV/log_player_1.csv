``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit. I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
