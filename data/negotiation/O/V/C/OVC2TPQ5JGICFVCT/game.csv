"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $1,050,000? This is still well below what it's worth to me, but it allows for a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
