Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still too steep for me.  I could consider a price of $950,000. That's a significant offer on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's worth seeing if I can negotiate him closer to $1,200,000.  We're not in a desperate situation to sell at his current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?  That's me coming down significantly from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to make this work."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,100,000 is a strong offer and exceeds my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profitable deal and avoids the potential loss of losing him as a buyer."
