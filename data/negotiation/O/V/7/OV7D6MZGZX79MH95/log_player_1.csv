Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming to get a higher price than $100, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on the product."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I think $110 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $110. While I would prefer a higher price, it's a good deal that surpasses my minimum price and is within my goal of maximizing profit.  There's a chance I could continue negotiating and get a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk of Bob walking away or me losing time. Accepting this offer ensures I make a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
