"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider something in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I'm working with a budget closer to $750,000. If you're able to come down to that, I think we can close this out today.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  I can tell we both see the value in this deal.  How about we split the difference and land at $775,000? That's my best offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $775,000 offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. I propose a counteroffer of $787,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,7,
