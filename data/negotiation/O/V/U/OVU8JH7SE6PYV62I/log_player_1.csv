"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a little extra to get the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,000 is below my minimum price, and while I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I believe it's a fair price that gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum price and closer to the middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum price and the same amount John is offering. While I'd prefer to get a little more, it's a fair offer and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
