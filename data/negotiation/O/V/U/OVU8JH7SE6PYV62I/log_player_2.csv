"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer,  $9,000 is a reasonable starting point,  representing a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potential better price. There are still 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but still wants a good deal. It's a compromise from his previous offer and likely to be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, it is still $500 more than what he could get from John. Since there are 5 rounds left, it's worth pushing for a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to drop her price further, especially since she rejected Bob's last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's budget is $10,000, and he is now willing to meet that limit.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't pay more than his budget.  Given that John is also selling the product for $10,000, this is a fair price for both parties, and likely the last offer Bob will make before buying from John."
