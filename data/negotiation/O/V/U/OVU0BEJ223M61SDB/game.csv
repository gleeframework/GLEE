"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $10500?  I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $9500 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9500 just isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $10000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, so how about $9800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
