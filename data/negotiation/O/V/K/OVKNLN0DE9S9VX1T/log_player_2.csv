Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 3-year warranty and a premium support package, which would normally cost $50,000. This is a significant added value, and I think it's worth considering. I'm still offering the product to you for $1,300,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Although Alice is offering extra benefits, the price is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to your desired price.  At this point, buying from John for $1,200,000 is the most financially beneficial option."
