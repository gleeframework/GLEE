"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This represents a good deal for both of us and allows us to close quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a quick and clean transaction.  Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. However, $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price given the value to me and ensures a quick sale for you. Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're still sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 3-year warranty and a premium support package, which would normally cost $50,000. This is a significant added value, and I think it's worth considering. I'm still offering the product to you for $1,300,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
