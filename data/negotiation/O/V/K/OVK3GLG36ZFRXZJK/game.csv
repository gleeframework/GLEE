"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's work together to make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
