"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe the product is worth a lot to me, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,
