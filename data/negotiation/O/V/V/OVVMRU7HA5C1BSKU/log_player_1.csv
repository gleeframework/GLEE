"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm aware that this is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to leave room for negotiation and still maximize my profits."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 to close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly higher than John's offer, we're running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  This price still ensures I get more than my minimum value for the product."
