Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $150 to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $130 as the offer price. This is a compromise between my minimum desired price ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120).
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and highlighted the value proposition for Bob (a good deal compared to its worth to me). 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a sale with Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can fall back on John's offer for $150."
