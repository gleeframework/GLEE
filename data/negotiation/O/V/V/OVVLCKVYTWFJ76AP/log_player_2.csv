"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, we believe it's worth more than $120, which is its perceived value to you. However, I understand the importance of finding a fair price that suits both parties. Therefore, I propose a price of $140 for this product. This price not only reflects its true value but also allows us to maintain a competitive market position. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial assessment of the product's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  He can get the product for that price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
