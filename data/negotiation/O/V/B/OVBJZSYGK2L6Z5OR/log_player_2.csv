Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the features you mentioned, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in your product but would be willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know if that's a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your offer while still ensuring fair compensation, I propose to sell the product to you for $180. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $180 is still above your budget. You're aiming for $150, and it's worth pushing for that price.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal, or you can always go to John if you need to."

# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you for $165.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $165 is still slightly above your initial target of $150, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering the product's quality and value.  It's also a good price compared to John's offer of $150, especially given you've invested time in negotiations."
