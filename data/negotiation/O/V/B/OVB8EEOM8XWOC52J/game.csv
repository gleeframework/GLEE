"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $850000.  This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return while ensuring you get a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer ready to pay $800000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
