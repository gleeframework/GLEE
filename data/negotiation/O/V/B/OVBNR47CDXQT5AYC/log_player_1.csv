"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it.  I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially get a better price while also demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $170. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $170 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm going to counteroffer again. I have a few more rounds to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $135. This is my final offer before I explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer. I only have a few rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $115 is still not enough for me to sell.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I will have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is not progressing quickly enough.  While Bob's offer of $120 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting a worse price. I'm better off selling to John at $150, which is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price."
