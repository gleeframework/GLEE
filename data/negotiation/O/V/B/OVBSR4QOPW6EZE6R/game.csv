"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe that's a fair price for the product based on my research.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $750000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident in the product's value and believe a price closer to $900000 is more appropriate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
