"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to acquire this product at a lower price point.  Let's start with $1200000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value this product holds.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly,  let's try $1400000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a great deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1400000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
