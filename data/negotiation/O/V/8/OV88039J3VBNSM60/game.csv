"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but based on the value we place on the product, I am unable to accept $700000. I would like to propose $750000 as a counteroffer. This still represents a significant discount from our original asking price, while also reflecting the value we see in the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not budging on $750000, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $680000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob.

"I'm glad we're discussing additional terms, Bob. Considering your interest in the product and the possibility of adding value beyond the price, I propose a compromise at $725000.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider $690000? I think it's a fair price for the product's value and the additional terms you mentioned.",690000.0,Bob,8,
