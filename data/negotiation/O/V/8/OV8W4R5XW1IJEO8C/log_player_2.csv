# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our flagship product to you. This exceptional item has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. It's not just a product; it's an investment in excellence. Given its value and uniqueness, I believe it's worth more than $1,500,000 to you. However, to facilitate a transaction and considering the current market conditions, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This is an opportunity to own something truly extraordinary at a price that reflects its worth while providing you with significant savings. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's flowery language attempts to persuade you, it's crucial to focus on the numbers.  Here's why rejecting is the right move:

* **You have a fallback:** John offers the product at your absolute maximum price ($1,500,000). This means you're guaranteed to get the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice's starting price is higher than your fallback, but there's a good chance she'll come down, especially since the product is worth significantly less to her ($1,000,000). 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, increasing your chances of getting the product for less than $1,200,000."
