"Hey Alice, that's a great product, but $120 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
