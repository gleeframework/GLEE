"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best I can do at this point.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are very close.  However, $8,500 is still pushing beyond what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to make one final offer of $7,900.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to go with another option I've been considering.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, Bob, but I still need to prioritize my own interests. I can meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",8000.0,Alice,7,
