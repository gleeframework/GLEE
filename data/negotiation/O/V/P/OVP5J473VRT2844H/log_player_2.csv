"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 just yet. I'm willing to come down to $115, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is closer to his target, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He's only had two rounds and there's still room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $110?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $115, which would be $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Time is Money:**  With only 5 rounds remaining,  Bob needs to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the potential savings.
* **Small Difference:** The difference between $112.50 and Bob's target price of $105 is relatively small. 

While Bob could try for another counteroffer, the risk is that Alice might be less willing to negotiate further, and he could end up with a worse deal or forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the safer choice to secure a reasonable price within the limited rounds."
