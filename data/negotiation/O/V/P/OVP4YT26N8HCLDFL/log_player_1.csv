"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building Relationship:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to encourage a positive interaction.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Keeping the John Option Open:**  This offer leaves me the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I can counteroffer Bob and try to reach a compromise. 
* **Keeping the John option open:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would give you a good price and allow me to recover some of the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's closer to Bob's value, increasing the chance of agreement.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **John Option Still Open:**  I'm still holding onto the possibility of selling to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. I would like to propose $11000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $11,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing John:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I might lose the chance to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, meaning we're halfway through the negotiation process. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and reduces the risk of a breakdown.

While $11,000 isn't ideal, accepting the offer offers a reasonable outcome with less risk and a faster resolution compared to continuing the negotiation."
