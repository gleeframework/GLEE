"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* It reflects the value I place on the product, which is at least $15,000.

I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or counter with a price I can still work with. If his counteroffer is too low, I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair offer and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $14,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and I'm getting closer to my initial goal. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
