"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $90?  That's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $100. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
