"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not sure if it's enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm a little confused. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but it seems like we're moving further apart. I need to be closer to $9,500 to make this work.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to accepting the offer from John for $8,000. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
