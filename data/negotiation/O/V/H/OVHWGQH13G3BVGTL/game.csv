"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to say that $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and your budget constraints.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still concerned about staying within my budget. I would like to propose a new counteroffer of $975000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but no lower. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",990000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I respect your efforts to reach a fair agreement. Given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet your latest counteroffer of $990000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $970000. I hope this proposal will allow us to close the deal while staying within my budget.",970000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $985000. I've already made a significant concession, and I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $985000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",985000.0,Alice,7,
