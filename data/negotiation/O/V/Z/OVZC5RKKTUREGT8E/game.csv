"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for considering my counter.  $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about $7,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I understand your position, but $7,500 is still significantly below its value.  I can go as low as $11,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
