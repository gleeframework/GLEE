"Thanks for the offer Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $13500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to offer you $12000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12500? It's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
