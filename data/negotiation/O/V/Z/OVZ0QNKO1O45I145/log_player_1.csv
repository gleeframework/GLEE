Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting at $119 leaves little room, it keeps the option open for Bob to counter-offer.  Even if he negotiates you down a little, you're still making more than selling to John.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give yourself more bargaining room.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a less aggressive starting price."
