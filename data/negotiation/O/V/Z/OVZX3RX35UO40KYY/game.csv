"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it would be even more valuable to your company. I'm willing to sell it for $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for you, while also allowing me a good return on my investment.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still confident the product holds more value for you than $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000.  This price recognizes the value you've outlined, but also allows me to make a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
