{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it would be even more valuable to your company. I'm willing to sell it for $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for you, while also allowing me a good return on my investment.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $950,000 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer seriously.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This offer allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a final price closer to her ideal goal of $1,000,000.  She can then decide whether to accept a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than her initial offer of $950,000.  Alice believes the product is worth more and wants to try to negotiate a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, she can make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.  She's not yet willing to sell to John for $800,000, as there's still potential to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still confident the product holds more value for you than $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000.  This price recognizes the value you've outlined, but also allows me to make a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** Alice is lowering her price to $900,000, meeting Bob halfway between her previous offer and his counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price that is above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** Alice reiterates the value the product holds for Bob while also highlighting her own need for a fair return on her investment. This creates a sense of partnership and fairness.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Alice is hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, allowing her to secure a higher price than John's offer. She's still willing to negotiate but is showing she's serious about maximizing her profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective and respect the value of the product. However, based on our previous discussions and my current budget, I believe we can find a more equitable solution. I propose a price of $875,000 for the product. I hope this suggestion will lead to a mutually satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is now very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While she'd prefer to get closer to her initial target of $1,000,000, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's also possible that Bob won't budge further, and accepting his offer now secures a profit for Alice.  Since there's a risk of losing the deal, Alice decides to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $875,000."
