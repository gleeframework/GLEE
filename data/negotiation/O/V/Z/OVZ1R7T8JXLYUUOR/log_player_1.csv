Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob a potential profit.  By starting with a higher price, I can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is close enough to my desired price of $1,350,000 that it makes sense to accept.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a sale at a price that is still favorable to me."
