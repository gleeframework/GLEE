Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer, which would be $837,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the price difference is small enough that it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the price remaining above $800,000."
