"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
