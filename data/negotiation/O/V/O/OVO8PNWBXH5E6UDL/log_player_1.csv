Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that's a bit aggressive, but still reasonable. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a premium price, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it given the value I think the product has. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $750,000 and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll aim a bit higher than Bob's offer, but not too high, to see if I can get a better deal.

Let's try:

{""product_price"": $820,000}

This is a reasonable compromise between Bob's offer and my original price. Let's see how Bob responds!"
