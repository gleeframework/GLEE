Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm going to buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. John is offering the product at my ideal price, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
