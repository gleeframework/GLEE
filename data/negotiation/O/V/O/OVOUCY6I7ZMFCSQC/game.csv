"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000.
