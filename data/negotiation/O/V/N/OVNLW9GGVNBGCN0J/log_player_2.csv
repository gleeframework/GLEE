"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still $200,000 more than I want to pay.  I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value to me, and it would give you a substantial profit as well. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $800,000 to $850,000.  While I'd prefer to pay $700,000,  $850,000 is still a good price, especially compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. I'm going to accept Alice's offer."
