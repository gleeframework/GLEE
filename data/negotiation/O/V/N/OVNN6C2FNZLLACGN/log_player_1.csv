Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high offer ($1,500,000), you set an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, you're more likely to land a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value"" and ""potential""  attempts to justify the high price without revealing your hand or giving Bob concrete reasons to counter. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't know much about Bob's negotiation style. If he's highly price-sensitive, you might scare him off.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive approach might be warranted."
