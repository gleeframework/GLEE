Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. Can we discuss further?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000. She's using classic negotiation tactics by introducing time pressure (""one-time offer"") and emphasizing her previous concessions.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, meeting your maximum budget.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
