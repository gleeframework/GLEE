"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. Can we discuss further?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I'm willing to spend on this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating.",11000.0,Alice,5,
