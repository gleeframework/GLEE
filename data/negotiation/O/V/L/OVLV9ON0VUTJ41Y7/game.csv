"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me right now. How about we settle at $9,750 and call it a deal?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,5,
