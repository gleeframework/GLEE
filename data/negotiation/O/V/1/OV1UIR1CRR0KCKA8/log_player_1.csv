Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and better than selling to John. There's always a risk of further negotiation going down, and I don't want to miss out on a decent sale."
