Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small window open in case Bob wants to negotiate slightly, potentially getting you closer to $120.
* **High Starting Point:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your minimum price."
