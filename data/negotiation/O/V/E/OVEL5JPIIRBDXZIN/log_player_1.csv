Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we settle for $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us and avoids the need to go back and forth further.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away."
