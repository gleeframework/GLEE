"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify going up to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move a bit.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $1,100,000. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,162,500?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1162500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  While I appreciate the move towards the middle, I'm still aiming a bit lower.  How about $1,100,000 even? This seems like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
