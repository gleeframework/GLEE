"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
