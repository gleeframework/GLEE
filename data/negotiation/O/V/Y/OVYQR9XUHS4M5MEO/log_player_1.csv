Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, potentially worth $1.5 million to you. I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a strong offer ($1.3 million) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($800,000). 
* **Highlight Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him can encourage him to seriously consider the offer even if it's high.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This first offer is also about understanding Bob's willingness to pay. His response will help determine your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting halfway is a positive sign, indicating he's very interested. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below his perceived value of the product. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we know its worth and encourage him to make a better counteroffer closer to his $1.5 million valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me partway. To be fair, though, this product has the potential to generate significant returns for you, potentially close to the $1.5 million mark.  How about we settle at $1,275,000? It's a fair deal considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession ($50,000) than Bob to signal we're nearing our limit but still open to negotiation. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We're reminding him of the product's high potential value, justifying the higher price. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a price well above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,225,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,225,000 is a significant profit margin above our $800,000 minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could push for more, Bob's concessions are getting smaller, and the potential gains are less certain.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer, putting our guaranteed $800,000 with John at risk. 

It's better to secure a great deal now than risk losing a substantial profit by being too aggressive."
