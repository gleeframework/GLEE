"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in it. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob's counteroffer is $150,000 lower than Alice's offer. This is a significant amount, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** While the price is still above Bob's maximum, it reflects the value he sees in the product while acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit.
* **Positive message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it also allows me to recoup a portion of my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,350,000 is still above his maximum of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate in the hopes of reaching a lower price, or he can choose to buy from John and avoid further negotiation.  Rejecting this offer leaves open the possibility of a better deal in the future."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:**  Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.

```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a lower price. He still has 5 rounds left and there's a chance Alice will come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to recoup a significant portion of your investment.  Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to reach a deal. While $1,275,000 is still a bit low, I recognize your financial limitations. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  I hope we can finalize this agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still $100,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Alice coming down to his price is low.  It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a deal within his budget and avoiding further negotiations with Alice."
