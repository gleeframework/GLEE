``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is simple, clear, and focuses on the value proposition for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, knowing that Bob will likely counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth process. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** The message subtly highlights the fact that I have other options (John), creating a sense of urgency."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in it. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept and lock in a sale, I need to prioritize maximizing my profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in subsequent rounds.  There's still room for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind. This acts as a safety net and gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to reach a compromise."

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
