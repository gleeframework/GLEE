Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the [product name] but I'm only willing to pay $125 right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $175. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the [product name]."", ""product_price"": 175}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $140 is still below my minimum value, and I think I can push for a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155. This is a fair price, considering the value of the [product name]. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 155}
