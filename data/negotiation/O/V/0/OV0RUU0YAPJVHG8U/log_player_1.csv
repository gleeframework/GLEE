Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our own $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring a significant profit for you (Alice).
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision faster.

**Important:** We don't want to offer a price too close to $1,200,000 because it might discourage Bob from negotiating at all. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
