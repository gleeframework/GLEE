"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible. Since Alice is offering $11,000 and you're willing to spend up to $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get an even better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered the price to $10,800, which is within your budget and closer to your initial counteroffer of $10,500. Accepting her offer saves you $1,200 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better price."
