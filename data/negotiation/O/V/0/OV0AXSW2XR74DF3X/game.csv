"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,
