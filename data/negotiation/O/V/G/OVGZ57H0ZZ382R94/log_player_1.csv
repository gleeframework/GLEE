"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $20,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I want to try and get more, and I have 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer but still leaving room for me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer more, this is a decent profit, and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's not worth risking a deal and potentially ending up with John's offer of $15,000."
