Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $130. I think it's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $110 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still aiming for a higher price and believe there's more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
