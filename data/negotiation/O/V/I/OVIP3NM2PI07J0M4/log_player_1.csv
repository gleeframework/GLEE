"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, inviting him to counter-offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has offered $10,500, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Rejection:** It's too early to accept his offer. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. 
* **Counter-Offering:** I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering your interest in the product. This reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $11,500, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing both my willingness to negotiate and the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Progress:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a higher price in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or his offers might decline further.  
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting this offer ensures a relatively good outcome and a quick sale, reducing the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
