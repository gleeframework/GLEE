"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down to $11500, considering your interest in the product. This reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
