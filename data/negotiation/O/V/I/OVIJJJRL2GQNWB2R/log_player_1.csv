Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  The message directly asks for Bob's decision, prompting a response.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential to pay a premium. If he rejects this initial high offer, you can then negotiate down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
