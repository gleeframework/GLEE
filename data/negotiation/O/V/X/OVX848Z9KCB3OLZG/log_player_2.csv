You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, you should aim to negotiate a lower price.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your desired price point.  By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. This allows for potential room for negotiation while still remaining within your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than your desired price of $10,000. Since you can buy the product from John for that price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer at this point.  By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate with Alice and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's still below Alice's current offer, and it's closer to your desired price point, making it more likely for Alice to accept.  This counteroffer balances the need to save money with the desire to potentially reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your budget.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll come down to your desired price.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
