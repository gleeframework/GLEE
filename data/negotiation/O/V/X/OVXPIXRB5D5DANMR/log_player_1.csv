Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Since John is willing to pay this price, I'm not losing anything by starting high.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay my asking price, and if not, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $110. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than what Bob offered.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
