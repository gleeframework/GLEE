,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to be within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm motivated to sell, $11,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at that price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
