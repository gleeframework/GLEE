Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think it would be really valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $120, getting any amount above your minimum ($120) from Bob is a win.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $120. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning you're offering it to Bob ""first"" and at a ""special price,"" you subtly create a sense of urgency, encouraging a quicker decision. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
