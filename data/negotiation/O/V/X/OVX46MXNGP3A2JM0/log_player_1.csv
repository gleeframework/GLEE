"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point, and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $8,800 is a fair price for the product. I'm really interested in buying it, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum price, I still feel like I can get a bit more. It's only round 4, and I haven't reached my limit yet. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of closing a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to come down to $9,200, but that's my final offer.  If you're truly interested in the product, I urge you to accept this. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $8,600 is a fair price for the product. I'm really interested in buying it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are now in round 6, and Bob's offer of $8,600 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've only got 4 rounds left and John is offering my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
