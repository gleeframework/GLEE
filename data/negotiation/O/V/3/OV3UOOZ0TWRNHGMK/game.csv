"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $1,250,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
