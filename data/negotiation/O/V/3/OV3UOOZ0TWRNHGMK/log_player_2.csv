Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This price still leaves room for me to gain something from the sale, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for you as well. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, $1,275,000 is a good deal. It's significantly less than John's offer and a reasonable compromise from our initial counteroffers. There's a risk that Alice might not come down much further, and we'd lose out on this price."
