Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It is also below Bob's maximum value, so there is incentive for him to accept.  

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for the best possible price, not just settling for the minimum.
* **Below Bob's value:** This gives Bob a potential benefit from accepting the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some wiggle room to come down a bit.

However, it's important to remember that:

* **There's always risk.**  Bob could reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for John's price.
* **You need to be prepared to negotiate.** If Bob counters, you'll need to decide if it's worth lowering your price further."
