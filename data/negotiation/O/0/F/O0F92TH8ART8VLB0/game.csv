"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality,  $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500. This offer represents a fair price that aligns more with my valuation.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's value and your interest, I propose a price of $12,500. This still reflects the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a win-win for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
