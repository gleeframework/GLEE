Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

``` 
This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $10,200 is a good profit over your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. John's offer provides a safety net but only at your minimum acceptable price.

 Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable deal with a lower risk of losing the sale entirely.
