Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000
* **Lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,200,000

This gives Bob a good deal, as he still gets the product for less than his estimated value, and allows me to make a significant profit. 

This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects this initial offer. However, I'm also aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I know Bob values the product higher.  

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial proposal. This will give me a better chance of securing a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a significant profit:** The price is still substantially higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  The reduced price shows I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** This counteroffer is likely to be attractive to Bob, as it's closer to his desired price.

I believe this counteroffer increases the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
