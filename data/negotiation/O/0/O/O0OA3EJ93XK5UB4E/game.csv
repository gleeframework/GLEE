"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle or consider a smaller discount?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13000. This is still a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price or consider a smaller discount?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell the product to you for $12250. This is as close to your budget as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price or consider a smaller discount?",11000.0,Bob,6,
