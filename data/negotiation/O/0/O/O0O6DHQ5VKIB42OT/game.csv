,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $10,200 is a bit too high. How about $9,500? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
