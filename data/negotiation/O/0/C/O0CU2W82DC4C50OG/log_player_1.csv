I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I am not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  I'd rather sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
