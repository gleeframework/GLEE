"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can offer you a compromise at $16,000. It's a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
