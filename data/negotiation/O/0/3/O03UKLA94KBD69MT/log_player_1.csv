Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob would receive.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a higher price if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a significant amount, but I'm willing to make a compromise to get the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates a willingness to negotiate.  There's room to counter with a higher price.
* **John is Still an Option:**  I can always choose to sell to John for $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to a deal closer to $900,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a good starting point for us to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Higher Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal but still below my minimum acceptable.
* **Highlighting Value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that even $900,000 is a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate further, leaving room for Bob to propose a price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** While John offers a higher price, I want to see if I can reach a compromise with Bob and get a better deal without involving John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's getting closer. 
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer. Further negotiation might not be productive. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a significant profit. 
* **John's Deal:**  While John's offer is higher, the added hassle and potential for a stalled negotiation with Bob doesn't justify the extra $350,000."
