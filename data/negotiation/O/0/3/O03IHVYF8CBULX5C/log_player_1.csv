Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, your message emphasizes the ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more to Bob in the long run.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level and sets the stage for further negotiation."
