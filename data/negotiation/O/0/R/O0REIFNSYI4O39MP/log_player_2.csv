"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,000 is still within Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Counter-offer is closer to Alice's value:** This offer is closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000, making it more likely she'll accept. 
* **Shows good faith:** Bob's counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $13,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price. There's still room for a compromise before Bob needs to consider buying from John."
