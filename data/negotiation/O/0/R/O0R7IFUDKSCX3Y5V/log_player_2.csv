Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,200?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

Even though Alice came down in price, we can still try to get closer to John's price. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,350? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,350

Alice is very slowly coming down in price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed $10,000 deal."
