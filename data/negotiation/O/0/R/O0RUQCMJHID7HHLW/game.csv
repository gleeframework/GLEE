"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on a better deal. I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment, bringing the price down to $10,500. This is still a great value for the product, and I think you'll find it worth the extra $500.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I can do $10,250, but that's really as high as I can go.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on a better deal just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and my original offer, which is $11,000. I'm offering it to you for $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it worth the extra $500.",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I can tell we both want to make this deal happen. My final offer is $10,400.  If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",10400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on a better deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, bringing the price down to $10,600. This is still a great value for the product, and I think you'll find it worth the extra $200.",10600.0,Alice,9,
