"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special price of $95. This is an excellent chance to acquire a valuable item at a discount. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product. While $95 is less than John's price, it's still more than you need to spend. By rejecting this offer, you stand a chance of getting a better deal from Alice or can buy it from John for $100."
