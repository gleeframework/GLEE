"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Could you consider that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $6000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $8500? I think that's a good balance between our interests.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",7200.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. How about we meet at $8000? I think that's a fair price, and it's actually the minimum I'm willing to sell it for.",8000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000, Bob. I think that's the minimum I can accept, and I'm starting to think it's getting a bit too late in the negotiation to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8000, so I'll offer $7500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,10,
