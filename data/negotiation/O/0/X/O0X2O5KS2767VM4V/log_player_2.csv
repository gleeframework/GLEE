"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my desired price range, but I'm still aiming to get it for $7,000 or less. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and while I'd ideally like to pay $7,500, getting it for $8,250 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $10,000. It's time to accept and close the deal."
