"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $135 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $165 and $145, which would be $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
