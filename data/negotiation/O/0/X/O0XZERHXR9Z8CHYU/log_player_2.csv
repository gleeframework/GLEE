You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,100,000 from Alice versus $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Even though you could save more money by negotiating further with Alice, the goal is to buy the product, not necessarily get the absolute lowest price.**  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product."
