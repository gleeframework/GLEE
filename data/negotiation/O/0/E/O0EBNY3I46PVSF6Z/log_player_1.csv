"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,700,000. I'm confident that once you see what it can do for you, you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I establish a strong anchor point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and his counter-offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial price provides ample room for me to negotiate downwards throughout the 10 rounds, making concessions that seem significant to Bob. 
* **Maintaining a Margin:**  While I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, my goal is to maximize profit. This initial offer keeps the possibility of a much higher sale price open.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate and aim higher. I started very high, so his counter-offer wasn't unexpected. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and draw him closer to my desired price point.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my fallback option, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Considering the unique advantages this product offers and its long-term value, I propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $100,000, which is a significant concession that might signal flexibility to Bob. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm not dropping too low too quickly. I'm still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial valuation and my guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a collaborative and positive tone, emphasizing the product's benefits and our shared goal of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that the product's price should be more aligned with my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000. I hope this is within the range you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically, consistently increasing his offers by a significant amount ($100,000) each round. While $1,400,000 is a good offer, I believe I can push for more, especially since we are only on round 4 out of 10.  The risk of losing him to a breakdown in negotiations is still relatively low.  I'll counter with a smaller concession to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,550,000?  This reflects the value it brings while recognizing your budgetary considerations."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000 this time, a smaller amount than Bob's consistent $100,000 increases. This signals that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between his last counter-offer ($1,400,000) and my previous offer ($1,600,000), which is often perceived as fair in negotiations.
* **Direct & Action-Oriented:**  I'm using more direct language (""Let's find a middle ground"") to encourage him to move towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price, Alice. However, I still believe that the product's value should be reflected in a price closer to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,450,000. I hope this is a step towards reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,450,000 is a significant profit margin above my $1,000,000 minimum and my guaranteed offer from John.
* **Pattern Established:** Bob has consistently increased his offer by $100,000 each round.  It's unlikely he'll deviate now.
* **Time Factor:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiations.  Continuing increases the risk of Bob walking away or my needing to concede too much in later rounds. 

While I might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting $1,450,000 is a smart business decision."
