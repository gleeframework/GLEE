""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **John as Backup:** The guaranteed $800,000 from John provides a safety net, ensuring you don't go too low with Bob.

This offer strikes a balance between ambition and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
