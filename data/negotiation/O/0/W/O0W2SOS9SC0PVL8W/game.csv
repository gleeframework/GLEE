"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire to get a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects a significant concession from my initial price, and I'm confident it still represents a great value for you. Let's get this deal done!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $887,500. This offer is closer to your target and still allows me to get a fair price. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",887500.0,Alice,5,
