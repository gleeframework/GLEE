{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to my starting point than if I had started low.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product is a bit pricey for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. 

It's clear that there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this lowball offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, potentially even closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (but still above minimum):**  I've lowered my price by $20, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still well above my absolute minimum of $80 and am aiming for a price that provides a reasonable profit.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This language suggests fairness and compromise, making it more palatable for Bob to accept a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I haven't drastically dropped the price, reinforcing the idea that the product is valuable and worth a decent investment.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active while still aiming for a price that's beneficial for me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has only increased by $10, and it's still below both my minimum acceptable price and his perceived value of the product.  It seems unlikely that further negotiation with Bob will result in a significant price jump.  

Selling to John for $80 guarantees that I won't lose money on the deal and avoids the risk of further drawn-out negotiations with Bob. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a sure sale."
