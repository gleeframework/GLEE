"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You know her product is worth significantly less to her than her asking price, and you have the option to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can likely get a better deal. We started quite low, so there's still room to negotiate upwards without getting too close to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. It seems we both have some room to move. How about $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price, but you're still aiming for a price well below her current offer."
