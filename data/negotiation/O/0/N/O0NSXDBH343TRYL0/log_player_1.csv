I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value. I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than my initial asking price, but it's closer to my ideal value. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for us both and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is close enough to my desired value that I'm willing to accept it. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's still significantly more than what John is offering, and it avoids further negotiation."
