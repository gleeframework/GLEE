Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept or make another counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum value of $1,500,000.  If things stall or I'm not satisfied with his offers, I can always go with John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for it immediately. There's a chance I can get a little more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable middle ground and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and while I could try to squeeze out a little more, I'm not sure I'd get a better offer from Bob.  I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose him as a buyer."
