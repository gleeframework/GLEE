Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially landing a higher price than $12,000.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  Starting too low might make Bob think the product isn't valuable. 
* **Set a Firm Tone:** The message implies this is a good deal without being overly aggressive. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, given the information provided, Alice seems more interested in maximizing her profit than guaranteeing a sale to Bob specifically."
