Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
