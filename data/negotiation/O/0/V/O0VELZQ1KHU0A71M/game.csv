"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a great deal for someone like you who values its potential. I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
