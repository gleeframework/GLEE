# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm starting the offer at $20000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $9000 simply doesn't reflect the worth of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.
