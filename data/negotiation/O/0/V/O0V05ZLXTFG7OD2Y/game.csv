"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras and your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
