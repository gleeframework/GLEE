"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose $1,950,000.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value and your initial asking price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,700,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  This product has a lot of potential beyond what you might be currently valuing it at. Would you consider $1,825,000?",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
