"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
