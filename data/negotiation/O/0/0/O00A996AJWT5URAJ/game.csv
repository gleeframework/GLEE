"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another option.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down so far.  I'm really interested in this product, but $10900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.
