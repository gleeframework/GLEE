"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 is more representative of its worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a number closer to this range to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, I'm getting closer to my limit and may consider buying from John if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a slightly higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hesitant. I'm not sure if I'm willing to go that high. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and the competitive landscape. However,  $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  If we can agree on this, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
