"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 is more representative of its worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a number closer to this range to make a deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your point about the value of the product, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a slightly higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and the competitive landscape. However,  $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  If we can agree on this, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
