It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $950,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $900,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good deal. It's lower than what I'd pay for the product from John, and I can save $75,000. It's time to accept the offer and get the product."
