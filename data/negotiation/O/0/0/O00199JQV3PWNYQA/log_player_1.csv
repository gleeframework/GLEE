Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get a good chunk of that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $950,000. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $900,000. Since this is still a significant amount less than the product's true value to him, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $900,000, I'll try to get closer to the true value of the product to him. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer. Here it is:

{""product_price"": $925,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $925,000. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
