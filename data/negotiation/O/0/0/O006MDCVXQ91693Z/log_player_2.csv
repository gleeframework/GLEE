"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate or head over to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting you closer to the middle ground, but you're still above your ideal price and can leverage John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while staying below your $80 limit. It's getting closer to Alice's likely minimum, so there's a chance she might accept."
