Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but also demonstrating my confidence in the value of the product.  I'm eager to see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm confident I can find a price closer to my target with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. I'm offering $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value to you. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm determined to get as close to my target as possible. I want to push for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still holding out for $1,090,000.  This would allow me to make a profit while still keeping the price fair for you.  Let's close this deal with a little more give and take, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}
