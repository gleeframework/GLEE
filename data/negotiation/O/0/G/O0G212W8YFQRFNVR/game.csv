"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $110. That's still a great price for such a valuable product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $108 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and come down to $112.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price. Let me know what you think.",112.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. While $109 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $111. This is a final offer from me, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",111.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $111. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108. Would you be willing to consider that?",108.0,Bob,8,
