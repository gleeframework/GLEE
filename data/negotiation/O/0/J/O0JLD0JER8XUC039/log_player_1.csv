{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $11,500 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for both you and Bob to negotiate and potentially find a price that works for both parties. 

By being open to negotiation and setting a price that's attractive to Bob, you increase the chances of a successful sale and maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $10,500 is still above my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting it right away. I want to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price."
