"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium. It also gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I'm holding out for $120, and I have the option of selling to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my target.  With only four rounds remaining, I don't have time to keep negotiating with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get my desired price."
