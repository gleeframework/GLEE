"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, reflecting a compromise on my initial price. I'm confident this is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits for you.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
