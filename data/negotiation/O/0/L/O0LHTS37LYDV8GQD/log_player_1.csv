"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $150 and allows room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is too low.  While I could accept it, I believe there's still potential for a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to go even higher.  If he doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155} 
```

I'm countering with $155. This is my final offer.  It's just above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to it.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging on his offer, and it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway.  While I'd prefer to get more than $150, I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure a guaranteed price."
