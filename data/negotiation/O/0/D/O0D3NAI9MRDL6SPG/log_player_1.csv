Round 2

Bob's offer is too low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop the price to $140.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $125 is still too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle at $135. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to move on."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price.  How about $130? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

I've had enough of this back-and-forth with Bob. I'm not getting any closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's acceptable to me. I'll sell to John."
