Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a quality item."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get more than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message aims to be appealing without revealing your bottom line. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If he's a tough negotiator, he might reject the offer hoping you'll lower the price. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the sale to Bob."
