Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000, given its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob."
