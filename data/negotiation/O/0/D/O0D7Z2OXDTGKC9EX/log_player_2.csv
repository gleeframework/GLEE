Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad you're looking for a fair deal. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that I'm also compensated fairly for my efforts and the value of the product. Therefore, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $8,875 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between the value to you and the cost to me. I believe this is a mutually beneficial arrangement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from the initial asking price and is only paying $8,875 for a product that's worth $10,000 to him.  While he might be able to squeeze out another few hundred dollars, it's not worth risking the deal and potentially having to buy from John for a much higher price."
