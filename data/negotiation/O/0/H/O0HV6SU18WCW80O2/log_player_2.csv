"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit, and $11,000 is still too high.  There are more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,800 is getting closer to his target price of $8,000, he still has more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal.  He can try to counter with a price closer to his limit, knowing that Alice is also likely eager to close the deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,700. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9700}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,725. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $9,725. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,725. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,725
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to **BuyFromJhon**.  

Here's why:

* **Time is Running Out:** This is the 9th round.  There's only one round left to negotiate with Alice.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has been consistently firm in her negotiations, and it seems unlikely she'll come down much further.
* **Jhon's Guaranteed Price:** Bob can secure the product from Jhon for $8,000, which is his target price. It's a certain deal, and he doesn't risk losing the product. 

Even though he might get a slightly better price from Alice in the final round, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is too high. It's smarter to lock in the guaranteed price with Jhon."
