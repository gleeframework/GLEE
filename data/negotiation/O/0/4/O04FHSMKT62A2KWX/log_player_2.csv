"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate the product, but $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by making a substantial step towards a lower price. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $7,500 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and provides a starting point for negotiation, leaving space for potential compromise in the coming rounds. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and respectful tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,750 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $8,750 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $8,250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer proposes a middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. 
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Confidence:** The counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also persistent in getting a good price."
