"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $7500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with $8500. I'm willing to go up to $8000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
