I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this amount or if he'll counter with a lower price.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further. I'm ready to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

Bob has finally come up to my minimum acceptable price. Although I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept his offer of $15,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John at the same price and potentially losing out on a better deal in the future."
