"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. I believe this will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still potentially securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I'd prefer to explore whether Bob is willing to pay more.  There's still potential for a better deal, and I have nine more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could potentially push for more, the risk of further negotiation and rejection isn't worth it with only 6 rounds left.  It's better to secure a profit of $10 rather than risk ending up with only $100 from John."
