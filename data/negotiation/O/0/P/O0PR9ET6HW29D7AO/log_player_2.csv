(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for you.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $150, which is your maximum price."
