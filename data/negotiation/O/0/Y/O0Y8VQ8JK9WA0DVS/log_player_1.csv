Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider $94?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $94 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of rounds. If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll continue to lowball me, and I might end up with less than what John is offering.  It's time to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
