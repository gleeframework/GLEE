Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $18,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $17,750.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,750

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly anchored around the $17,500-$18,000 range. Accepting his offer of $17,750 ensures a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away."
