"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get an exclusive deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* It's early in the negotiation, so there's room to try and get a better price. 
* There's no immediate urgency to accept since you have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget.
* There's still room to negotiate as you have the option to buy from John for a lower price.
* Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation open and potentially allows for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's settle this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you a deal for $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $800,000.
*  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds. It is unlikely you will be able to get Alice to drop her price significantly further.
* You have a guaranteed deal with John for a lower price.
* It's more beneficial to secure the product for your budget rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price."
