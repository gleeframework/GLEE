"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's settle this and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you a deal for $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",870000.0,Alice,5,
