"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product from you. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This price is fair, given your valuation, and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
