"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product from you. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This price is fair, given your valuation, and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"
