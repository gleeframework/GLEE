Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. It's a great deal you don't want to miss!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a bit more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a deal for Bob while still being advantageous to you if he accepts. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
