(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  $9,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Let's start by making a significant counteroffer.  $8,000 is a reasonable starting point. We can always go lower if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can push Alice a little further. $8,500 is still a good price, but we can try to get it closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
``` 

Let's try a slightly higher counteroffer. $8,200 might be a good middle ground. We're showing Alice we're serious about buying, but we're still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $8,400. This is a good price, especially considering we're only a few rounds away from having to buy from John. Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
