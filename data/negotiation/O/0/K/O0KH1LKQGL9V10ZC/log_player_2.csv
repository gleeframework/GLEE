"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your initial offer, there is still room for negotiation.  You can likely secure a better price by continuing to bargain. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price of $750,000."
