"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to make a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000, which is a good middle ground. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
