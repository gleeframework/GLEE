Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,400,000.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting high aims for the maximum potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value allows for some back-and-forth if he tries to negotiate.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net.  This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price outweighs the risk of losing out on a smaller profit from John."
