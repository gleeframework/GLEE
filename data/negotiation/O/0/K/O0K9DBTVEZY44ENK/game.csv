"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is too significant a drop. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
