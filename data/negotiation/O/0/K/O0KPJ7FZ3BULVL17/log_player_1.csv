Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, allowing Bob to counteroffer if he wants. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $90 is below my minimum of $100, so accepting it would be a loss for me. 
* **I have a better alternative:** I can sell the product to John for $100, which is a better deal than Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. How about that? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by lowering my price, showing flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is still open-ended, allowing Bob to counteroffer if he wants.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **I have a guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit, whereas continuing with Bob risks ending up with an even lower price or no sale at all.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
