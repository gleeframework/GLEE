Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below that."
