Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While selling to John guarantees $12,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a little high. 
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. However, without knowing Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to stretch his budget, it's best to start high.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes no additional information about Bob's negotiating tendencies or the nature of the product itself."
