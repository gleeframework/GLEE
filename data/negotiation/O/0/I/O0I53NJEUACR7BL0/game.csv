"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get a good price for the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
