"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **There's no reason to buy from John yet.** You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. 
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $11,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price.**  While she has come down, you're still looking to save as much as possible.
* **It's worth continuing to negotiate.** There's room for Alice to come down further.
* **Buying from John isn't the best option yet.**  You might be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
