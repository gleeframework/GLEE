Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Confidence:** The message implies the product's value, making it clear that the price isn't arbitrary. 

This approach balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob could reject $14,000, but it's a calculated risk to aim high and potentially secure a much larger profit than accepting John's guaranteed $12,000."
