"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
