Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
This initial offer is ambitious, but it leaves room for negotiation. The price is above Bob's perceived value, but it's significantly lower than my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to bite, and gauge his response. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  Selling to John would yield a much better profit, but I'm willing to explore Bob's offer further. He has shown interest, and I'm hoping to reach a compromise. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm trying to signal that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to sell for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,500,000. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm confident that selling to John is the best option to maximize my profits."
