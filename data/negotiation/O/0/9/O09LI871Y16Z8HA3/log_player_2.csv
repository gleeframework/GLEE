It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to potentially save a lot of money."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice closer to my desired price range. I'm hoping this will prompt her to consider a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $500,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice is still too high. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 510000}
```

I'm increasing my offer one last time to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my target. I'm hoping that this final counteroffer will convince Alice to accept. If she doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer."
