"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value you'll receive. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
