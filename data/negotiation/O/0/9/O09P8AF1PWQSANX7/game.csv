"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $14,000 is already a very competitive offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to accept $12,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
