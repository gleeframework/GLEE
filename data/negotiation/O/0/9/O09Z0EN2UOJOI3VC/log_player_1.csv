"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
 
This strategy aims to: 
* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price higher than your minimum allows room for negotiation while aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate his eagerness and provide insight into his valuation.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** You can always adjust your price downwards in later rounds if needed. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is starting at his maximum valuation, which means there's likely room for negotiation. We can do better than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer suggests a price halfway between your initial offer and Bob's offer, aiming for a mutually agreeable compromise. 
* **Above Minimum:** It keeps the price comfortably above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Bob's response will indicate his willingness to move from his initial offer and guide your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with a price of $12,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has met your minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate a higher price from him in the remaining rounds."
