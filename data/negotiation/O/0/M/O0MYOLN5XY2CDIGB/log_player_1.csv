This offer is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to find a price that is mutually beneficial while also maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
