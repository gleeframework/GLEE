Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) but not ridiculously high. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussion and am not setting a hard price. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer shows interest, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my counteroffer.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize that the price still represents a good deal for Bob while also demonstrating my flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 

By offering a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price point, I hope to secure a deal that's favorable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $7800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** I've already negotiated twice and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge much further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

While it's frustrating to not get closer to my ideal price, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit and a smooth transaction.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'd rather secure a deal with him than risk further haggling with Bob."
