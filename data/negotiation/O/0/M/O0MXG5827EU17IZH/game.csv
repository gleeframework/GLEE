"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8500?  This still gives you a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you on this.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $7800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",7800.0,Bob,4,
