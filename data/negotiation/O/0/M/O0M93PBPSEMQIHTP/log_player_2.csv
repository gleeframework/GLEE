"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a valuable asset for you, and this price reflects its worth while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than the product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. You have a better alternative with John, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John makes the most financial sense."
