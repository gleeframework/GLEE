Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making it appealing to Bob while still giving me a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, highlighting the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob. This aims to build a positive relationship and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a reasonable offer that is likely to be accepted by Bob. If he rejects, I have the option to negotiate further. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I am willing to negotiate, I won't accept an offer that leaves me with such a low profit margin. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can get a higher price, and I'm willing to go through a few more rounds of negotiation before accepting a lower offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the fair nature of my counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. By offering a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. However, I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'm offering $10,200. I hope that's a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,200 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on for too long is high.  

**Strategy:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer because:

* **It's a decent profit:** $10,200 is a good profit for me, considering my minimum acceptable price was $15,000.
* **It's close to my ideal price:** I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob backing out.
* **Time is valuable:**  It's more efficient to sell now than to continue negotiating, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
