,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is my best offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
