Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
