"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I recognize its value, I'm still hesitant on that price. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $950,000 is still quite below what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and justify the investment.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  To be honest, I'm only comfortable going as high as $1,000,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
