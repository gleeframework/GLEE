"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal.  You know Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, you can start a counteroffer process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $850,000, which is a significant discount from her initial offer of $900,000. This is still above her valuation of $800,000, giving her some room to profit, but it also saves me $50,000. I'm hoping she'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is higher than my initial counteroffer and closer to her original asking price. However, I'm still not willing to accept it as it's not a significant enough discount for me. I will continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  John's price is still a fallback option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $875,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me, saving me $125,000 from John's price, while also showing Alice I'm serious about getting a deal. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting increasingly closer to her initial price and further away from my desired price.  She seems unwilling to budge further, and the negotiation is becoming more time-consuming. Given the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching an even higher price, I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best option considering the current situation and my budget."
