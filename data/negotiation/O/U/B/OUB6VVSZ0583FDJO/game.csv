"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. This product is worth $12,000 to me, so I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
