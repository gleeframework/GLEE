You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $12,000.**  
* **You have room to negotiate.**  A counteroffer will allow you to potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** This means you aren't desperate and can afford to be firm in your negotiations."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price of $12,000.** While it's closer, you can still try to negotiate a better price.
* **There's room for compromise.** You've already shown you're willing to negotiate and Alice has moved closer to your price point. 
* **You have a fallback option.** If you can't get the price lower, you can still buy from John. 

A counteroffer is the best course of action to try to get closer to your target price."
