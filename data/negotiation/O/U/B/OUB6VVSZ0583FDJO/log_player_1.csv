``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $12,000 but still above my minimum of $10,000. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. This product is worth $12,000 to me, so I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I want to get closer to my initial offer of $11,500.  I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and allows me to make a decent profit.  Further negotiation may result in a higher price, but it's likely to take more time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
