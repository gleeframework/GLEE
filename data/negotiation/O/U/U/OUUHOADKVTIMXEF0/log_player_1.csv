Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get a little more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum, and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would love to get more, Bob's offer of $125 is only slightly below my counteroffer.  Given that I'm not guaranteed a better price from John, I'll take the offer and sell to Bob."
