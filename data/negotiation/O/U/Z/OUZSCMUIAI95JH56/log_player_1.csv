Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.
