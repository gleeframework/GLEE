Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Below Bob's value:**  $9,500 is less than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 

This creates a space for negotiation, giving you a chance to potentially earn more than $8,000 but also leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it is still below what you're hoping to get. It's worth trying to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than his perceived value, but it gets me closer to my desired price.  We're both moving closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price, or even a rejection by Bob, is too high.  It's time to take the deal and secure the sale."
