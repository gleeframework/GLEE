"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the first offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in this situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's fair for me as well. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best option in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about $12,500? That's a good compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This gives you a good deal, and it's more in line with what I need.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been trying to get the price down, but it looks like Alice is firm on her price. Accepting the offer for $13,500 is the best option here. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject and there isn't much room left for him to lower the price.  He's already saved $1,500 compared to buying from John, so it's time to close the deal."
