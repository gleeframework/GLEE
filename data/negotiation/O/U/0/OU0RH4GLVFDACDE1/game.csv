"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
