"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its high value to you at $8,000. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to negotiate further.

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $8,000. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can close the gap. You're likely to get a better deal from John, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product to you at $8,900. This is a price that reflects the value you place on it, while also allowing us to come to a satisfactory agreement. I hope this proposal works for you.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. Since you can get the product for your target price from John, it's more advantageous to buy it from him."
