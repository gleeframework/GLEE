"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to counter his offers or walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still reflecting my belief that the product is worth more than $14,000.  I hope this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more.  $14,200 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14300} 
```

I'm going to offer $14,300. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'm going to see if I can get a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14150} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,150. This is a small concession, showing that I am willing to negotiate, but still closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that we are very close to an agreement and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.  While $14,050 is close to my minimum, I'm not confident that I can get a higher offer from Bob in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the sale to John for $10,000 than risk getting nothing."
