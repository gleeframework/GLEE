"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  $1,800,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counter again, but I'm getting nervous as we're running out of rounds."

I'm going to make one last push for a higher price.  $1,650,000 is a decent compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept.  If not, I might have to consider selling to John in the next round."

It's getting tight!  I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to squeeze a little more out of him, but I'm getting very close to just selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is only $20,000 above my minimum.  It's just not worth the risk of another round.  I'll sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
