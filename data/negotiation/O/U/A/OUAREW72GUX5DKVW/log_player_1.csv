Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the higher price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I still sell the product at my minimum acceptable price."
