# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8500 is too low for me to consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your compromise. However, $9250 is still a bit low for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $9400 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher amount to make this deal worthwhile for me.
