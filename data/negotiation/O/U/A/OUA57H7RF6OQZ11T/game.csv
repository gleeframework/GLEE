,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8500 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9250. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your compromise. However, $9250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $9625. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you think?",9625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9625 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9400. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.  Let's close this deal!",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $9400 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher amount to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,7,
