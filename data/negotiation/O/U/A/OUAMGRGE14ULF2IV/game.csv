"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,000. It's the most I can afford, but I'm genuinely interested in the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to meet at least my minimum target of $12,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $13,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
