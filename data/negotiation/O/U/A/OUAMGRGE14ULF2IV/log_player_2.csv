"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way too high.  It makes sense to reject and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

$14,000 is still too high for Bob. It's better to reject and counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to meet at least my minimum target of $12,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $13,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000."
