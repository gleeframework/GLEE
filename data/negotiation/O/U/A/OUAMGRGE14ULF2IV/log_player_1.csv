Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
