"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you and the initial offer I made.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To be honest, $800,000 is really the highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
