"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
