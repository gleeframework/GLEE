"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1700000. Would you be willing to consider $1600000? I think that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $1620000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1620000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1700000.
