"Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you.  I'm asking for $150 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to buy the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
