Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you're in a strong position. You can aim higher with Bob, knowing you have a safety net.  The key is to balance ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're positioning the product as desirable and exclusive.
* **Premium Pricing:** The $1,750,000 price aims for a significant profit margin, capitalizing on your strong position.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might need to start lower and be prepared to haggle.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might be slightly less aggressive with your initial offer.

**Remember:** This is just one approach. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob and your negotiation style."
