Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit but low enough that Bob finds it acceptable. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Starting with ""pleased"" and highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" frames the offer positively.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Strong Price:**  $1,350,000 is a significant markup from Bob's valuation but leaves room for him to counter-offer while staying comfortably above your guaranteed sale price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you can tailor your message accordingly.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a clear strategy for how you'll respond to maximize your gains."
