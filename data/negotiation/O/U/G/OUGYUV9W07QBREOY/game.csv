"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  Let's try $115. It's closer to your offer and still leaves me with a decent profit.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. How about $100? That's my absolute max.",100.0,Bob,6,
