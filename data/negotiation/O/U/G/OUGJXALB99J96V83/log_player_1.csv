"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the potential it holds for someone with your insights, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $15,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we settle on $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 makes the most sense at this point. It's a solid profit over my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
