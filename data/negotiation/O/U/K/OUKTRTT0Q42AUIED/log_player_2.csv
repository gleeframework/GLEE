"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to rush into buying from Alice when a counteroffer could potentially save him more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. However, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he would pay John and closer to his target price. While further negotiation might be possible, accepting this offer saves time and effort, and ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price."
