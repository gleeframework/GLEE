# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. It holds significant value to us, and we believe it would be equally beneficial for you. We are offering this exceptional product to you for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to try and negotiate with Alice, you have a guaranteed alternative with John for a better price.  It's always wise to secure the best deal, especially when there's a risk of a prolonged negotiation with an uncertain outcome."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your current budget and appreciate your offer. However, considering the value and unique features of the product, we are unable to accept $1,200,000. Our counteroffer for the product is $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely to be a drawn-out process with an uncertain outcome. You already have a guaranteed deal with John for your desired price.  It's best to secure the best possible deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
