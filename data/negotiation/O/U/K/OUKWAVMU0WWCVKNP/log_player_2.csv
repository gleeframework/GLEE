"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us.  How about we start the conversation at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's starting offer of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she's willing to come down to a price closer to your budget or proceed with your backup plan (John)."
