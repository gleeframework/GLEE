I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It also demonstrates the value I place on the product.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything less than what the product is worth to me.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to consider, while also ensuring I get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. It's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk further concessions.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll take the safe route and sell to him."
