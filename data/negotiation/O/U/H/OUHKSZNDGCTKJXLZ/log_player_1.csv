I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my asking price.  $8,500 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'm also starting to think about selling to John if I can't get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer,  $8,750 isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,900.  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8900}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm getting closer to my target price with Bob, it's taking too many rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is more than what I'm likely to get from Bob."
