"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to give you a good deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering you value it at $15,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's still a good deal considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering your value of the product, and I think it's worth exploring.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. It's getting close to the value you place on the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you making another concession, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this moment.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,750. It's still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
