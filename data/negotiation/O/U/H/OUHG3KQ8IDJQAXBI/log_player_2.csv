"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to give you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to accept this offer immediately.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering you value it at $15,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. It's still a good deal considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your price, $16,000 is still outside your comfortable range.  You have several rounds left and a reliable alternative with John, so there's no need to rush into accepting yet.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating towards your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering your value of the product, and I think it's worth exploring."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. It's getting close to the value you place on the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,500, which is getting closer to your limit. However, you still have 5 rounds left and the backup option with John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer could potentially get you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you making another concession, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really aiming for a price closer to $12,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,750. It's still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still above your comfortable range.  You have three rounds left, and the backup option with John provides a safety net. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better deal.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer could potentially bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,750, but I'm still hoping for a better price. How about we split the difference at $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. While Alice has come down in price, $13,750 is still outside your desired range. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000.  It's not worth risking another round with Alice and potentially getting stuck with a higher price.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at your target price and saves you valuable time and effort."
