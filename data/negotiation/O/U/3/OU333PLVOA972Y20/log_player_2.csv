Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see we're close to reaching an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $810,000, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's finalize the deal at this price.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly committed to small increments. While we could try to squeeze out a few thousand more, there's a risk she'll become less willing to negotiate.  $810,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and a reasonable price considering our valuation. It's time to close the deal."
