"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. Is that something you'd consider?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise at $140. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",140.0,Alice,5,
