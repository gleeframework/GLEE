{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategically priced:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** It's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving me room for negotiation.
* **Below my minimum:** It's lower than my minimum price, allowing for potential compromise without compromising my bottom line. 
* **Reasonable starting point:** It's a clear starting point for a conversation, and I'm ready to listen to Bob's perspective. 

By starting with this offer, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he's not interested at this price, I can adjust my offer or move on to John, who's willing to pay my full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $10,000 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, and appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I respect your position and the value of your product. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. This price allows me to get a good deal while also providing you with a fair profit. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by selling to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed profit and a faster transaction. It's time to move on and secure a better outcome for myself."
