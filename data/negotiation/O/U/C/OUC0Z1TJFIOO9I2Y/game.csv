"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true value, but I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
