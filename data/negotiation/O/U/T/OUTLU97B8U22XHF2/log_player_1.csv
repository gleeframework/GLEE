{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving you room to negotiate. It also emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value for the product. It's better to try to negotiate further with Bob than to settle for his offer or sell to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $9,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum desired price. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere if I need to."
