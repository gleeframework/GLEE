"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a price closer to your initial valuation, but I need to make a profit on this.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This gives us both a little room to be happy with the deal. What do you think? ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
