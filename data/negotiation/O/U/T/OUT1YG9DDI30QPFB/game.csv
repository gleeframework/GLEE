"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $125, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to go up to $115, but no higher. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,6,
