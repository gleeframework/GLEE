This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly. I believe this price point represents a win-win for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000 to me.
