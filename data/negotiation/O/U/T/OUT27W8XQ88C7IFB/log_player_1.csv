Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be immensely valuable to you, potentially worth at least $1,000,000 in the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,999,999.  I think it's a steal at this price, considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with an extremely high price ($1,999,999) sets a strong anchor.  Even though it's much higher than Bob's perceived value, it makes the following strategies more effective.
* **Scarcity and Exclusivity:**  The message subtly implies the product is highly sought-after (""in the right hands"") and that Bob has an exclusive opportunity.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high initial price leaves significant room for negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can gradually decrease the price, appearing flexible while still aiming for a final price significantly above $1,000,000.
* **Backup Offer:** Knowing John provides a solid backup, Alice can be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on psychological pricing tactics. There's no guarantee Bob will accept the initial high price or even engage in a negotiation. However, it maximizes the potential profit for Alice given the circumstances."
