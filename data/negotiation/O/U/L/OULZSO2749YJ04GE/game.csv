"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, so I'll counteroffer at $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'll try to find a compromise. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $105, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $110? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $105, Alice. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one final offer: $105. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",105.0,Bob,10,
