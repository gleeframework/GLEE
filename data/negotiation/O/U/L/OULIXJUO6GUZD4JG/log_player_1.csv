"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to be mindful of the fact that Bob has a limited valuation for the product. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to reach a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $95 for it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum threshold, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum threshold but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and explaining my reasoning for my counteroffer. I'm also emphasizing that this is still a good deal for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still holding firm on my minimum threshold. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to offer $100 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has finally met my minimum threshold of $100.  Since I can sell to John for the same price, there is no benefit to rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and secure the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, without risking losing the sale to John."
