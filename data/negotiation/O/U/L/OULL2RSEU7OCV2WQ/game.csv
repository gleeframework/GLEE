"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product and think it would be a great fit for me, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  That's a big step for me, and I think it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is a tough negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm going to have to stick with my last offer of $950,000. It's my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",950000.0,Bob,6,
