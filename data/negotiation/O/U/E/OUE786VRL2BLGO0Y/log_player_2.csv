"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's still room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his desired price and Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm lower bound."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. There's still room to negotiate further.  $122 is close to Bob's desired price range, but there's no reason to rush into a deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $122 is closer, but I'm still a bit high. How about we split the difference again at $118? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm with his negotiating strategy. By proposing a price that's exactly in the middle, he's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and avoids the potential of a stalemate."
