"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price slightly above my minimum, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive opening message helps build rapport.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Leaving space for a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and avoids a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $90 is still below my target range.
* **Counteroffer potential:**  I believe there's room to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While $80 is guaranteed, I'm aiming for a higher price and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $95?  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a higher price.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob reinforces the value proposition and encourages acceptance.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, making it less arbitrary and more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Limited time:** We're already halfway through the rounds, and accepting now guarantees a profit. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get a better price, especially since Bob is already indicating he's reaching his limit. 
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John is a safety net, I'd rather make a small profit with Bob than settle for the lowest price."
