{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since I can get the product from John for $8,000, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a good starting point, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what John is offering. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than what John is selling for. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying from her, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price lower than her previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm getting closer to my ideal price, but I'll continue to negotiate with her. I'm confident I can get a better deal before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8850}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but just slightly to $8,850. This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still not willing to go much higher than my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair considering her previous offers and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,800 is just $800 more than what John is offering. I'm willing to pay that extra amount for the potential benefit of a better product or service from Alice.  Since I only have a few rounds left, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that could lead to me having to buy from John at a higher price."
