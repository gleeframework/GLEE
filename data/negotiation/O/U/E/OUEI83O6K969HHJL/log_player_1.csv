``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's potential value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I indicate my willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope it's acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a moderate reduction:** I'm decreasing the price from my initial offer of $2,000,000 to $1,900,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Highlight the reduction:** I emphasize that the $1,900,000 price is a significant reduction from my initial offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Hope for acceptance:** I express hope that the offer is acceptable to Bob, promoting a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time for a more aggressive counteroffer:** Since Bob continues to offer below my minimum, I need to be more assertive to push him closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  I'm starting to feel the pressure as we are in the middle of the negotiation. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,700,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm firm on my price of $1,850,000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm taking a more assertive approach by stating my price is ""firm."" This shows I'm not willing to drop much further.
* **Final compromise:**  I'm positioning the $1,850,000 offer as a ""final compromise"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value justification:** I reiterate the product's value to support my price.
* **Direct request:** I directly ask Bob to ""meet me at this point,"" emphasizing the need for a decision. 

**Why I'm not accepting Bob's offer:**  Even though this is getting close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept anything below $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1725000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited time:** We have only 4 rounds left.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can push Bob a little further to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safe option:** If I don't get a better offer from Bob in the next few rounds, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $1,725,000 is still too far below my minimum.  To make this work, I need to see an offer closer to $1,800,000. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Focus on compromise:**  I emphasize the need to find a compromise, making it clear that I'm still open to negotiation.
* **Specific price range:**  I provide a specific price range of $1,800,000, giving Bob a clear target and showing that I'm willing to move closer to his offer.
* **Collaborative tone:**  I use phrases like ""bridge the gap"" and ""find a solution"" to maintain a collaborative tone and encourage Bob to keep negotiating.

**Why I'm not accepting Bob's offer:** 

* I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. 
* While selling to John is always an option, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.
* With only 3 rounds left, I need to take a more assertive approach to push Bob to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1750000, which is closer to your minimum. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to the last two rounds, and there is significant risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Not enough to justify the risk:** While $1,750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. There's not enough time to negotiate further and risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John is the safe option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a sale and ensures I meet my minimum value.  

It's a tough decision, as I'm still hoping for a better price, but with the limited time remaining and the uncertainty of Bob's willingness to negotiate further, selling to John is the most sensible choice to secure a deal."
