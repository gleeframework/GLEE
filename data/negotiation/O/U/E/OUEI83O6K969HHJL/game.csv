,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1700000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm firm on my price of $1850000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this point.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $1725000 is still too far below my minimum.  To make this work, I need to see an offer closer to $1800000. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
