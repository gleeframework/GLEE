"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $900,000 is a significant amount of money, and there's a chance you can get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but also provides a good starting point for a potential compromise. I'm aiming for a price that's about 20% lower than her offer, which is a reasonable discount to expect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal closer to my initial counteroffer of $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still pushing for a lower price. It's a midpoint between my initial counteroffer and Alice's latest offer, and hopefully signals a willingness to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept. We're now in the middle of the negotiation, and I believe I can still push for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only slightly, to $775,000.  I'm aiming to signal to Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway but still want to secure a price closer to my initial target.  This should keep the negotiations moving towards a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now approaching the mid-point of our negotiations.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, I'm aware that we have limited rounds left.  Accepting this offer means I save a considerable amount compared to buying from John, and we're getting close to a reasonable price.  It's a good compromise that balances saving money with the risk of losing the deal."
