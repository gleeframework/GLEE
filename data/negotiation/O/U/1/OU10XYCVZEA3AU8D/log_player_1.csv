Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately rejecting his offer.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging while also highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  Starting high but leaving room for negotiation increases the chance of securing a higher price.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** A friendly tone can lead to more fruitful conversations and potential for a win-win situation. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I'm still keeping the alternative sale to John in mind, ensuring I don't get stuck in a negotiation that yields a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer. It's possible he might walk away, but there's also a chance he might be willing to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to secure a higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. This will involve a careful consideration of what price would be both acceptable to me and potentially enticing enough for Bob to accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me at this point.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased the price from Bob's offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant jump but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a compromise designed to show good faith and leave room for further negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position and expressing my willingness to compromise, while also emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to test Bob's commitment and gauge his willingness to move closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Act:** This counteroffer balances the need to secure a higher price with the risk of pushing Bob away. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It allows me to see if Bob is serious about acquiring the product and if he's willing to increase his offer.
* **Preparing for the Next Round:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to make a final counteroffer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's continued interest, his final offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to take such a significant financial loss, even if it means missing out on this deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss of $250,000, a considerable amount. 
* **Time and Effort:** I've already invested time and energy in this negotiation.  However, continuing to bargain with Bob is likely to lead to further delays and potentially more concessions, further eroding my potential profit.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John offers a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum requirements and ensures I don't lose out financially. 

**Conclusion:**

Although I'd prefer to sell the product for a higher price, I've reached a point where the risk of continued negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision."
