,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. ",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  That way we can both be happy with the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
