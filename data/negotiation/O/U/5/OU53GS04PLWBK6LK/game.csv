"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
