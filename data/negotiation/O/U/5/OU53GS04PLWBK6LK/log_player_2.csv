Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?

Alice has become firmer on her price of $1,200,000 and is unlikely to go much lower.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk Alice walks away. Accepting now secures the product at a price well below John's offer."
