"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's a chance Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $200,000 decrease from her initial price is a substantial starting point.  If Alice is willing to meet me halfway, I can still get a good deal and save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price by $50,000. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she'll walk away or increase her price again.  At $1,150,000, I'm still saving $350,000 compared to John's price, making this a good deal."
