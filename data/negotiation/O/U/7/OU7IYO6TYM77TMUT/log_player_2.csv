"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is way above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget, I'd be happy to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
