"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $90 is your current limit. While I can't go down to that price, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This would be a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to pay $90, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80",90.0,Bob,6,
