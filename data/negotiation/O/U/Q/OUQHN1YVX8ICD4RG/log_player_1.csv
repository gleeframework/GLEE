Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about we bring it down to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, and Bob has shown interest.
* **Avoiding the ""Jhon"" option:** Selling to Jhon guarantees $1,500,000, but I have 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's still a great deal for you, and allows us both to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his offers are slowly climbing. There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's more favorable for me.
* **Avoiding the ""Jhon"" option:**  While selling to Jhon is a guaranteed $1,500,000, I have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair compromise that allows me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value to you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
