"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for something worth so much to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob a good reason to negotiate while still leaving me some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $120, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This price aligns better with what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to get closer to $110 or $115.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $107.50.  It's a good middle ground and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and I'd like to counter with $105. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is now above my minimum value of $120. While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already rejected a few offers and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower price."
