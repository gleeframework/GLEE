"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  Could you consider $1,850,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,850,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're making a serious offer at $1,200,000.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
