Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price. However, I have to consider the value this product holds for me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

We are now getting close enough to Alice's value that pushing further risks her walking away.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better result than $825,000."
