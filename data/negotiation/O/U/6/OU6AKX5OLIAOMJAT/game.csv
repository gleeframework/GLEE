"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am currently looking to stay within a budget of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider this lower price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1450000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet at $1450000. I would like to propose a price of $1425000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",1425000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1430000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1430000.0,Alice,5,
