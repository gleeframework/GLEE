Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and moving towards our desired price point. It's time to make a smaller concession to keep him engaged."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,825,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your perspective."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it offers. I'm getting close to considering John's offer, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is signaling that he's nearing his limit and considering John's offer. Accepting $1,750,000 is a significant profit over John's $1,500,000 and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
