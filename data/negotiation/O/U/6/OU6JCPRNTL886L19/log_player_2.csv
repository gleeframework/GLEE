"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $500,000. This offer reflects my budget constraints while acknowledging the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower, it's still more than John's offer of $800,000.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the most logical choice at this point."
