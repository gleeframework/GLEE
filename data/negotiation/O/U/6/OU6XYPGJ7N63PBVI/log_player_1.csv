"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired range by negotiating further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $12,500, which is closer to my desired price than selling to John for $10,000. While I could try to negotiate further,  there's a risk of losing the deal completely and having to sell to John.  Accepting the offer ensures a good profit, and it's better than risking a lower price or no deal at all."
