"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There are 9 rounds left, so there's time to try and get closer to Bob's ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a lower offer, but not too low, to show Alice he's serious about buying the product while also leaving room for negotiation. This offer is still above Alice's minimum value, giving her an incentive to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There are 7 rounds remaining, so Bob can continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price but is willing to compromise. By offering $12,500, he's showing a willingness to move closer to Alice's position, but still maintaining a price that's beneficial to him.  This offer gives Alice an incentive to accept, as it's closer to her minimum value, while also giving Bob a decent deal."
