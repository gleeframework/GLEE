"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, but I'm interested in making a deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than my expectation.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,075,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still well above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in a small bonus of $5,000 if you accept this offer. This is my final counteroffer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,087,500. This is my final counteroffer. Let's reach a deal.",1087500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation but your final offer remains too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,080,000, considering the bonus. This is my absolute final offer. If we don't come to an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
