"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  I'm willing to be flexible here, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $121? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",121.0,Bob,4,
