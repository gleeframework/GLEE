"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible. Starting by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer gives you the best chance of doing so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $115, you can potentially get it for even less.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $108.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
