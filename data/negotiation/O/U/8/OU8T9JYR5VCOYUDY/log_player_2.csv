"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum value for the product.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than John's price of $1,200,000 and it's within Bob's budget.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in small savings, and the risk of Alice walking away is high. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a good price."
