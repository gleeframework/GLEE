I'll reject Bob's offer. I can still do better than $8,500, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I want to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price, especially since Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to pay more. I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher offer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're down to the last few rounds, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I was able to get Bob closer to my minimum, it seems he won't budge further. Selling to John guarantees me $8,000, which is more than my minimum and a safe option."
