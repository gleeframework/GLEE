"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value to me and the potential for us both to benefit from a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than that. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value it holds for you, while also being a reasonable profit for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
