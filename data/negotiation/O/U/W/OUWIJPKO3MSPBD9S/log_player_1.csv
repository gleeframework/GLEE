Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Knowing Bob also values the product at $1,000,000 creates a strong negotiating position for Alice.
* **Greed Factor:**  Setting the price at nearly double the value Bob places on it plays on potential greed. Bob might be tempted to find a way to profit himself, even if it means paying a premium.
* **John as Backup:** The guaranteed $1,000,000 from John acts as a safety net.  It allows Alice to aim extremely high with Bob, knowing she has a fallback option. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is risky.  Bob might be completely turned off by the inflated price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential for a much higher payout is there if Bob believes he can somehow leverage the product for even greater profit."
