"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject the offer and purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $900,000."
