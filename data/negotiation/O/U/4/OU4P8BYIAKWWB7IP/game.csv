"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Would you be open to discussing this further?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of 1050000. Would you be open to considering this revised offer?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. I can offer you a price of 1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
