"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Accepting the $14,000 offer would be a good deal, but Bob can likely do better.  Buying from John is the absolute last resort, so rejecting the offer and trying to counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible, and $13,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point for the second round, and Bob can adjust his offer based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, and there's still room for negotiation.  While $14,500 is closer to Bob's limit, he should continue trying to bargain with Alice to see if he can get a better deal. Buying from John is still the absolute last resort, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the best deal possible.  Since Alice rejected his previous offer of $13,000, he needs to increase the offer to make it more appealing.  $13,500 is a good compromise that reflects the need to make a deal while still saving money. It's also closer to Alice's previous offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. This strategy gives Bob the best chance of getting a deal in this round without resorting to John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum price limit, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a lower price.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of not getting a deal or reaching the end of the negotiation rounds without a deal is too high.  Buying from John at this point guarantees that Bob gets the product at a price he is willing to pay."
