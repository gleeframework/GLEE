Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would still be a great deal for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation, and I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair deal.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" is still above John's price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at this stage, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her accepting another buyer's offer.  It's time to secure the product from John at the known good price."
