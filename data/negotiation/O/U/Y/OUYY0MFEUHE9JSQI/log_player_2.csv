"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $13000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within range:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, pushing for a price closer to his ideal value. 
* **Justifies the offer:** The message provides a reason for the lower price, making Bob's position seem reasonable.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $11,500 is still above Alice's value, allowing for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $12500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and $12,500 is a good compromise point. 
* **Value:**  $12,500 is still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away outweighs the potential savings."
