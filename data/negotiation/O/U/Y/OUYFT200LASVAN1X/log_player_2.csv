Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make another small concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $815,000 and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation window. It's unlikely further haggling will yield a significantly better result. Accepting this offer secures a good price without risking the deal entirely."
