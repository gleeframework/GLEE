"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's room to bargain as the product is worth less to Alice than what she is offering.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and continue to try and get the best deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $887,500? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While $887,500 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and a reasonable compromise.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, and it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
