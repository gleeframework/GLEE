Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1600000} 

This offer is higher than Bob's estimated value, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a strong point while leaving room for compromise.  It also positions you as a seller who is open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired value.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. Selling to John would guarantee your minimum acceptable price, but rejecting and counteroffering gives you a chance to get closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a price closer to your initial offer. It is likely to encourage Bob to counteroffer again, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 above his initial valuation. At this point, the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.  Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a much more favorable outcome."
