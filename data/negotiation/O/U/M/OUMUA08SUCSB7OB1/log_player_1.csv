Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given the product's value to Bob and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this offer is still attractive to Bob, and it gives us a good chance of reaching an agreement."
