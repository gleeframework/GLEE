{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its value to both of us. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
    * Attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal if he values the product's potential. 
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting that you have another buyer (John) isn't necessary at this stage. It might create unnecessary pressure or make Bob feel like he's being given an ultimatum."
