"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no harm in seeing if you can get a better deal. You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $140. Is this a more comfortable price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'll counter again, hoping to get closer to my target price. There's still time and I can always buy from John if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $135. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at $135, which is just within my acceptable range. Given that I'm already in round 5, the risk of further negotiation is high. If I reject this offer, Alice might not budge any further, and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal, considering my initial goal was to spend no more than $150, and it's better than the $150 from John."
