**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, but Alice's ""final offer"" is still a significant markup from her perceived value. There's a chance she might be bluffing or willing to negotiate slightly lower in the remaining rounds. We're still under our $1,000,000 walk-away point, so the risk of continuing is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. I appreciate you being firm on your price, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $790,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground and close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 790000} 

**Reasoning:**  We are pushing closer to Alice's likely bottom line. By offering $790,000, we acknowledge her firm stance while still trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for ourselves. This approach shows willingness to compromise but also highlights our budget limitations."
