Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly below what John is offering, and it seems like Bob is willing to move a bit.  We'll hold firm for now."

We're getting very close to John's offer, but we still have a few rounds to try and get a bit more from Bob."

It's time to cut bait. Bob is unlikely to meet the $800,000 threshold, and we have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's not worth the risk of Bob going even lower or walking away."
