"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is higher than the product's worth to you ($150). It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $100 is a fair offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. How about $110? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is still higher than the product's worth to you ($150), but it's getting closer to your budget. It's a good compromise, and you're likely to save more money by accepting this offer rather than trying to negotiate further."
