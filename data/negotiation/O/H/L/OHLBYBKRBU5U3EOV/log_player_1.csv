Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so there's room to negotiate a price that's beneficial to both of you. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** By offering a slightly lower price, you demonstrate you're open to negotiation, making it more likely Bob will engage.

Remember,  the goal is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still securing a deal. You can adjust your offer based on how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is above your minimum, you can likely do better.  Bob clearly values the product at $10,000, so there's room to negotiate a higher price. You'll counter with a price closer to your initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're showing flexibility by lowering your price, but you're still asking for more than Bob's initial offer.
* **It's reasonable:** $9,000 is closer to your initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's positive and focused on a solution:**  Your message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both of you, making it more likely Bob will see it as a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit over budget at $9,000.  Would you be willing to go to $8,750?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  

* **You're close to your goal:** $8,750 is only $250 below your initial offer and a significant improvement over your minimum.
* **Risk of going further:**  If you reject and counteroffer again, you risk pushing Bob away. He might decide it's not worth it to continue negotiating. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $8,000 would mean losing out on $750. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it at this point."
