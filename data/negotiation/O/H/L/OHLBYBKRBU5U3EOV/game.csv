"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit over budget at $9,000.  Would you be willing to go to $8,750?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
