"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that I believe reflects its value. I'm starting with $900,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is higher than his maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 800000}
