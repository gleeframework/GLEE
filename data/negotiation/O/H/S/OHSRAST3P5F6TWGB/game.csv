,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  I'm serious about buying it if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $11000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the most I can afford at this time.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not making any more concessions after this point.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still interested in the product, but $11500 is just outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $11250.  This shows my commitment to buying from you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $11750. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,7,
