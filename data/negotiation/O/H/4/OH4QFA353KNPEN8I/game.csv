"Hi Alice,  $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $11,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $11,000 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $11,500.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
