Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $75 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! I can do $72 for the product. It's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting $72 gets the product within Bob's budget and saves him $8 compared to John's offer."
