Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting too close to my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer. It's time to secure the deal with John."
