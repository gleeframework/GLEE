Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to my business. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take that $1,400,000, I know the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me to consider.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not going to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm still hopeful I can reach a fair agreement with Bob, but I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1,300,000 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price is more in line with my budget and what I believe the product is worth to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would like to close a deal with Bob, his offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not going to continue to drop my price, and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a deal. John is offering me a fair price, and I'm going to take it."
