"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to my business. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1,300,000 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This price acknowledges your budget and the value of the product for your business. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. I'm confident this is our best chance to reach a deal.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price is more in line with my budget and what I believe the product is worth to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
