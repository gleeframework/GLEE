"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I have to make a profit. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $14,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",14200.0,Alice,7,
