Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $14,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is signaling she won't budge much from her last offer of $14,200.  It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than this from her. Since John offers the product for $15,000, it makes more sense to cut our losses and buy from John. We'll only save a small amount by continuing to negotiate with Alice, and there's a chance those negotiations could fail."
