"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
