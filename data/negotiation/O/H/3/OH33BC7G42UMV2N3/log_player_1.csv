Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but offering the product at that price will likely scare Bob away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her desired profit.
* **Time Value:**  While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
