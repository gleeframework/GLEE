,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $100. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
