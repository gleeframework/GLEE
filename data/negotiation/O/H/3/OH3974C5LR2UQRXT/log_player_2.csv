"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. While I can't disclose the exact details publicly, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, a price I believe reflects its potential value.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at $800000.  Please consider carefully, as this is a chance to acquire a significant asset at a potentially favorable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum price. You know John is willing to sell it for the same price.  There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer as the price is the same."
