"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. I believe that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $7,000 is still quite low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500,  but that's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget.  I can stretch to $7,500, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
