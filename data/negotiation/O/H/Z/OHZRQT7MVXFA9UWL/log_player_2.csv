"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is close to your maximum budget, you have a better alternative. You know John is willing to sell the same product for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $1,500 and stay within your budget."
