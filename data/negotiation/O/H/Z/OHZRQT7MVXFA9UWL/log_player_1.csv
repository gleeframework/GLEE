Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,500 as possible, as this is the highest price Bob might be willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures a faster transaction. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
