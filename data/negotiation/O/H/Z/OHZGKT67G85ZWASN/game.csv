"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
