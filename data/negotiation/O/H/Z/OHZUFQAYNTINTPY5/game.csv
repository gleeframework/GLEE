,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised by your offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go that low. I think you're getting a great deal at $130, and I'm not willing to give it away. I'm going to stick with my previous offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130, or I can sell it to John for $100. Your choice.",130.0,Alice,9,
