"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $19,000.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $19,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one?  I'd be willing to let it go for $15,500.",15500.0,Alice,5,
