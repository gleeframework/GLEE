"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. My asking price is $14,000, reflecting its high quality and potential value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a good price that reflects the product's worth to me, while also being mindful of the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than the $10,000 I would get from John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $14,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer.  While I value your interest, $12,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $13,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and it allows for a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is still a little below my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John. Given the limited rounds, it's likely that further negotiations will only result in a lower price, so accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point."
