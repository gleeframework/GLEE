"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Let's negotiate to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",

}
``` 

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer that's still below my maximum budget. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while potentially securing a good deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Even though Alice says it's her final offer, there's still room to negotiate. We're closer to her value, but I think I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested, but $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"",

}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise that's a fair bit closer to her price while still leaving me some wiggle room below my maximum."
