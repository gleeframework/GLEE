I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, it gives us room to negotiate and see what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum acceptable price and gives Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,100,000 is not a bad price,  it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I don't want to risk losing more money in further negotiations.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the safest and most secure option."
