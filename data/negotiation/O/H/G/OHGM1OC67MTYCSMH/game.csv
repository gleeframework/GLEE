"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $10,500 is still a little high for me.  How about $9,750? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $10,250. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  Would you consider $10,000? That's the absolute most I'm able to spend.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is the most you're able to spend, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500.
