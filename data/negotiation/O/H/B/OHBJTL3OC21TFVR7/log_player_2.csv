Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $10,800.  At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the best option to achieve your goal of getting the product at the lowest possible price."
