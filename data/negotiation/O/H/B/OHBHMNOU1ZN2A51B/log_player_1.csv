Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This price is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000, giving me the potential for a higher profit. 
* Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob values the product at $1,500,000 or higher, he'll accept and I'll make a good profit. 
* If he values it lower, he'll reject, and I'll still sell it to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I make at least my minimum target."
