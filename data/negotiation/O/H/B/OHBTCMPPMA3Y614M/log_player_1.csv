"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can secure a higher price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still a little bit away from that price.  How about $975,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
