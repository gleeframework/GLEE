"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be of great value to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 isn't a terrible price, you know you have John as a backup option at $12,000. There's a chance Alice might come down a bit in price, making a rejection the best strategic move."
