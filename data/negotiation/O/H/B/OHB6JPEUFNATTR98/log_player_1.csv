Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be of great value to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much money as possible above her minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob values the product at $12,000, starting with a slightly lower offer ($11,500) leaves room for Bob to counter-offer or feel like he's getting a slight deal.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $12,000 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer. Alice wants to strike a balance between profit and the risk of losing the sale to John, her backup buyer."
