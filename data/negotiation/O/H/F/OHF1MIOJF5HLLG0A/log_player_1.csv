Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price and still well above what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's above Bob's value but below your minimum. 
* **It's framed positively:**  It emphasizes the benefit for Bob while also mentioning your own needs. 
* **It invites a response:**  It encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This approach allows you to start the negotiation while keeping your options open. You can always adjust the price based on Bob's response or decide to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and it's worth trying to get a better price before selling to John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is still below your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and only $500 below your minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures you make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or the potential of selling to John for a higher price but at a higher risk."
