"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
