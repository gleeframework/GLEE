Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the opportunity, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and the market value, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.

Let's work towards an agreement.
