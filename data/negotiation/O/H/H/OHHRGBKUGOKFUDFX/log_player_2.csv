"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might incentivize Alice to make a counter-offer closer to her actual valuation."
