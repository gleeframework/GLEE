"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price. $90 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $90 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're aiming to get the price closer to Alice's value of $80, while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met us in the middle, and $82 is a great price, well below our $100 limit. There's no guarantee we could negotiate a better price, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
