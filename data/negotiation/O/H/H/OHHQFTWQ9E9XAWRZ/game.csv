"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product and willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's say $1,550,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect your budget limitations.  How about this - I'll come down to $1,425,000.  This is my final offer, as it's a significant price reduction and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
