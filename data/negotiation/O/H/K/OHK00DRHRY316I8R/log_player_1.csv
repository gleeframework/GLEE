Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room to go up if Bob counters, but it also shows you're not desperate to sell.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room to potentially negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price.  

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than your initial offer. For example, you could counteroffer at $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer of $12,000, and it's closer to your desired price than your initial offer.  It's likely that continued negotiation will not result in a significantly higher offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
