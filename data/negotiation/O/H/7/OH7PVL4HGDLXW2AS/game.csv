"That's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $130, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. ",130.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $130. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $145?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $145 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll make one more concession. How about we meet at $142.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product.",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, Alice, but $142.50 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $141? That's my final offer.",141.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $142.50. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. If you're not willing to meet me at $142.50, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Let's meet at $142.50, or I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",142.5,Alice,9,
