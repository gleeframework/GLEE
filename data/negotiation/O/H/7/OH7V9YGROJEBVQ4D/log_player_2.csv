{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $750,000 counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's $850,000, demonstrating your desire for a good deal.
* **Within your budget:**  This price is still well within your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Room for compromise:**  Alice is likely to counter, but this sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually acceptable price."
