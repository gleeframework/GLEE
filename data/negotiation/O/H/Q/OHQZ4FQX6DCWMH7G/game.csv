"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $13,500? That's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $14,250.  I believe that's a very fair offer considering its value.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $14,250 is still a bit above what I can afford right now. How about we meet at $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
