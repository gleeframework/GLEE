"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in your product, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'd accept $100 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $100 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $90 is closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $92. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're open to this.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you at $93.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're open to this.",93.0,Alice,7,
