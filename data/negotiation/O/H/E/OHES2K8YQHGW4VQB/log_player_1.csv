{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $8,000, so $9,500 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being ripped off. 
* **It's fair:**  It's not too aggressive, so you don't risk losing Bob right away.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer.  You want to see if you can get closer to your desired price. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go up to $8750 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. While it's still below your initial desired price, it's a significant increase from his previous offer and only $250 below your counteroffer.  It's important to balance your desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and gets you closer to your desired price point."
