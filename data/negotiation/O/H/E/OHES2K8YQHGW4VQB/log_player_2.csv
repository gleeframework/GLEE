"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer again and potentially get a price closer to his desired target of $8,500.  There's still some wiggle room before having to consider buying from John."
