"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price, considering it's still a good deal for you.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,875? That's my final offer.",10875.0,Alice,5,
