It's much too early to accept Alice's offer.  We can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

Let's start with a significant counteroffer to see where Alice stands.  $600,000 is a strong starting point for negotiation."

While $700,000 is getting closer to our desired price, it's still worth trying to push for a lower price.  We have 5 rounds left and could potentially get a better deal with a counteroffer."
