"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the initial price a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his stated value.  It's worth countering to see if you can negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the immense potential this product holds for your business."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me partway.  To be frank, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could make a move to $750,000 work. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I need to see a price closer to my previous number. How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product will bring to your company."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sensing we're close to a deal.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $812,500 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
