"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's best to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** Aiming for $80 gives you a significant discount while still leaving room for compromise to reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $110 is still above your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($80) and Alice's current offer ($110). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and suggests a clear price point, making it easier for Alice to understand and potentially accept. 
* **Still Below John's Price:** This offer keeps you below your alternative option of buying from John, ensuring you're still aiming for the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer it to you for $115, which is closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging on price, and her latest offer of $115 is still $15 above your maximum budget and $15 more expensive than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
