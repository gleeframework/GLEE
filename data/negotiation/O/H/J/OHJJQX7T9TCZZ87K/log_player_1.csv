Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500 by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $10,875? This is a good compromise and a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10875}
