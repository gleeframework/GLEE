"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's work something out.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need you to come down significantly. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be a fair starting point.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need something closer to $900,000 to make this work for me.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value to you, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I can move a little on my previous offer, how about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need something closer to $850,000 to make this deal work.  Let's try to find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $775,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $812,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us. ",812500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit ridiculous.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm afraid I have a firm budget. My final offer is $785,000.  Take it or leave it.",785000.0,Bob,8,
