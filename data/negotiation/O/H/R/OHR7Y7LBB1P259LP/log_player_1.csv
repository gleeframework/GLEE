I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my minimum value. I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing my desired profit."
