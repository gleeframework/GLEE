Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value increases the likelihood of him accepting.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's concise, positive, and acknowledges the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves a good profit margin for you ($150,000 above your minimum) while still saving Bob $50,000 compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  This offer assumes Bob is rational and looking for a fair deal. If you have insights into his negotiation tactics, you might adjust your strategy.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is beneficial for potential future deals.
