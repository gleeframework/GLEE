"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I'm offering you my product for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree.  $14,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is a final offer, and if you decline, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
