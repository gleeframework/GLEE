Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree.  $14,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is a final offer, and if you decline, I'll need to move on to another buyer.
