"I understand that you think the price could be more market-aligned, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, but I'm getting a bit impatient. This is my last offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
