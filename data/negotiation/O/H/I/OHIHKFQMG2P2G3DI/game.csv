"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This way, we both get a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the lowest I can go.",10025.0,Bob,4,
