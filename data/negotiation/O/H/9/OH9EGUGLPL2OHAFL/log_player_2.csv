Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for $775,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I can do $750,000.  That's the best I can offer, but it's a very fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $762,500. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $762,500

This is a close call, but Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting this offer gets me the product for slightly less than John's price, and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
