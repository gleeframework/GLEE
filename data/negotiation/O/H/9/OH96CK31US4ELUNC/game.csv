"Hello Bob, I am delighted to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $1,950,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's potential.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could make this work for $1,350,000. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $1,350,000 is just too low. I can go down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you call that your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This is a fair deal, and I won't go any higher.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
