"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,200. That's the highest I can go.",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $12,200 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,600.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",13600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,600. I'd be willing to go up to $12,500. That's the maximum I can stretch my budget to.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $12,500 is still below what I can accept. Let's compromise: I'll go down to $14,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that you are willing to negotiate.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,800. That's the maximum I can afford.",12800.0,Bob,8,
