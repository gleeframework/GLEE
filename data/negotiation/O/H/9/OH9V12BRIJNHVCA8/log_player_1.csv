Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This should pique Bob's interest without immediately being rejected. I'll be ready to adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way below my minimum.  While I'd like to get the best price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,200. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $12,200 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,600.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $12,500 is still below what I can accept. Let's compromise: I'll go down to $14,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that you are willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,800. That's the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

Bob's offer is still too low. With only two rounds remaining, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  It's better to be safe and sell the product to John for $15,000."
