{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit even if Bob accepts the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate further without needing to drop your price too significantly. 

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value, it's still below what you'd like to earn.  There's still room to negotiate, and you have the backup option of selling to John for $10,000. You'll counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, but still above your minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and it gives you a good deal too."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum value, it's still a significant distance away. You are still hoping to earn more, and have the option of selling to John for a higher price.  You will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to your ideal, but still higher than his current offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8,600? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 8600} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to pay $8400 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below your minimum value.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting tiring.  Rather than continue negotiating with Bob, you'd prefer to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
