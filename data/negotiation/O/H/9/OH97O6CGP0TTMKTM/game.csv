"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9000? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and it gives you a good deal too.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $9000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?,8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8200 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $8600? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for the value you'll be getting.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to pay $8400 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.,8400.0,Bob,6,
