"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you're offering.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11200. I think this is the lowest I can go while still getting a fair price for the product.",11200.0,Alice,5,
