""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this product, and I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Offering it at that price or lower guarantees a sale but leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * He saves $50,000 compared to John's offer.
    * It's still a significant markup from his own valuation, making it clear this is a valuable product.

**Important Note:** This offer aims to find a balance between a price Bob might accept and a price that yields a substantial profit for Alice. There's no guarantee Bob will accept, but it positions Alice to potentially earn more than selling directly to John."
