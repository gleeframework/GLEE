"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1200000 to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $800000 is too low for me. Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1000000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $975000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go up to $975000. I'm willing to offer you a slight compromise and sell the product to you for $965000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.",965000.0,Alice,5,
