"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1200000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob.  There's plenty of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is too low for me. Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down even further by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse deal than continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go up to $975000. I'm willing to offer you a slight compromise and sell the product to you for $965000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come very close to Bob's counteroffer, and at this point, the difference in price is minimal. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
