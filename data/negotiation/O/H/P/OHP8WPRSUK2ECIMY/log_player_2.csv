While $1,175,000 is closer to your limit, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before settling."

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge again or you might reach an impasse. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing it to John."
