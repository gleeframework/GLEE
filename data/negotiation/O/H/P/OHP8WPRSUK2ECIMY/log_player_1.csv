{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going straight to my minimum to allow for some back-and-forth.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encouraging to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept if it's close to my minimum, or counter with a slightly lower price.
* If negotiations drag on, I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a good deal for him, it's far below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room to negotiate, so I'm not going to sell to John just yet.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, hopefully finding a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000. I want to show I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a moderate decrease:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Appeal to shared benefit:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for both of us to encourage a positive response.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop to his price yet. This shows I'm confident in the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. 
* If he rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer.
* If the negotiations drag on, I'll revisit the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on the product and what I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **We're getting closer:**  The negotiations are moving in the right direction. It seems like Bob is willing to go higher, so I'm not giving up yet.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I can still push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer, but this time I'll go slightly lower to show flexibility while still protecting my bottom line.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $1,125,000 and $1,150,000. This will show I'm willing to meet him halfway but also maintain my negotiating power. 
* If he accepts, I'll close the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll carefully evaluate his counteroffer and consider selling to John if it seems unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price."

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm  lowering my offer to $1,125,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:** My message is encouraging and reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Finality:** I mention ""finalizing this deal"" to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll happily finalize the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as the negotiations are getting close to my bottom line."
