"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll agree.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
