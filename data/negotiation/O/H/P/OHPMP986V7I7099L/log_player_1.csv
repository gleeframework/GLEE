Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this offer represents a worthwhile investment considering its potential returns."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's ""value"" and ""potential returns"" to justify the high price to Bob. 

**Why not offer a lower price closer to Bob's value?**

* It leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might be willing to pay more than $800,000, especially if the product is unique and desirable."
