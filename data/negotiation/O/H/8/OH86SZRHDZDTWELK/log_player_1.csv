Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower my price slightly, but I'm confident I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $700,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair compromise. If he still rejects, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential sale to John. It's also a small concession, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite where I want it to be.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure deal with John.  It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000."
