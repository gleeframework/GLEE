"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and the significant benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Begin with an offer significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlight the product's ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price.  This framing aims to shift Bob's focus towards the product's advantages rather than solely on the price.
* **Leave Room for Concessions:**  The high starting point allows you to make concessions in later rounds while still aiming for a price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think $1,800,000 is a more realistic price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates room for further negotiation. You are better off rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer that brings the price closer to your target range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product shouldn't be underestimated.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $2,100,000 is my best offer right now. This price reflects the significant returns you'll see from its implementation."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By decreasing your price, you acknowledge Bob's offer and demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm:** The decrease is substantial but still keeps the price well above both your minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Reiterate Value:** Continue to emphasize the product's value and potential benefits to Bob. This reinforces the justification for a price higher than his initial offer. 
* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility.  If he's unwilling to budge significantly from $1,800,000, you can consider more drastic concessions or walking away to John's offer in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to your range, but $1,900,000 is still a significant margin above his perceived value. You have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better price. You are willing to risk losing the deal to potentially gain an extra $100,000 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $2,000,000? This price reflects the value you're getting while acknowledging your budgetary concerns."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle:**  This counteroffer directly addresses Bob's suggestion of ""meeting halfway"" while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final Offer Tone:**  The phrasing suggests this is a strong attempt to reach a final agreement, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Time Consideration:** With five rounds remaining, you have time for a couple more counteroffers, but moving closer to Bob's price shows you're serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I'd like to make a small concession to show my commitment to the deal. Can we discuss $1,950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,950,000 is a very good price, exceeding both your minimum and Bob's initial offer significantly.
* **Momentum Shift:** Bob making a concession, even a small one, indicates he's serious about closing the deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a slightly higher price (e.g., $1,975,000) carries the risk of Bob walking away. The potential gain isn't worth jeopardizing a solid offer. 
* **Time Remaining:** While you have rounds left, securing the deal now provides certainty and avoids the possibility of Bob becoming less flexible."
