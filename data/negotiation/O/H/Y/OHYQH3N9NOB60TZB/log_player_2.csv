"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, and I believe it's worth even more to you given its value to you is $120. Let's make this deal work for both of us. How about we start at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value to me. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with $85 and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value you place on the product, let's aim for a fair compromise. How does $90 sound as a starting point for us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still potential to save a bit more.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, aiming for a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $87.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering the value you place on the product, I think $92.50 would be a fair compromise. Let's aim for a price that respects the value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.5 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is willing to pay up to $120 for the product, so there's still a buffer to work with. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $88.75.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued efforts to reach an agreement. I propose we settle on $90.50 for the product. This acknowledges the value you see in it while remaining within my acceptable range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90.50 is getting closer to Bob's preferred price point. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise.  Considering Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $120, accepting this offer still yields a significant saving."
