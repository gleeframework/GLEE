"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,175,000. This price is fair considering both our positions and ensures we both get a good deal.  Let me know if you're amenable to this.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
