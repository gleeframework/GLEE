# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,300,000.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives you the potential to get a better price, potentially even lower than John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let me know what you think.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives you the opportunity to potentially get a price closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than what you can get from John.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving the price even higher.  It's more prudent to go with the guaranteed price from John and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
