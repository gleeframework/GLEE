Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer allows me to maximize my profits while still potentially securing a sale with Bob. Here's why:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000.** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John at this price.
* **Bob values the product at $12,000.**  This means he's willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Offering $14,000 gives Bob a potential $2,000 in savings.** This is a reasonable incentive for him to consider the purchase. 
* **If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John.** This ensures I get my minimum desired value, but I still have a chance to secure a higher price with Bob."
