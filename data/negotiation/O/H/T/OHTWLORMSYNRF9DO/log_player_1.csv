Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Knowing your discerning eye for quality, I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob saves $50,000 compared to his perceived value, and you make a significant profit above your fallback offer from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the likelihood of him accepting the deal."
