Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
