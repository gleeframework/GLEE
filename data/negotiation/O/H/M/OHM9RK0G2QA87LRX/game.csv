"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for something closer to $8,500, Alice.  While that's closer to John's price, I'd be willing to go up to $7,000 to make this deal work.",7000.0,Bob,4,
