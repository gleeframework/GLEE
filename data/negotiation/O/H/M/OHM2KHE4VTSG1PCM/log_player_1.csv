Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving me a strong negotiating position.
* **Confident Messaging:** By highlighting the product's value and potential ROI, I aim to influence Bob's perception and justify the high price.

By setting the initial offer high, I leave room to potentially negotiate down to a price that is still very profitable for me, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
