"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1350000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1450000. This is my absolute bottom line.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, let's close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1200000, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
