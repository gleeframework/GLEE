Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $2,000,000 for it.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive and inviting:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in further conversation. This can help build rapport and increase the chances of reaching an agreement. 
* **No pressure:** The message doesn't force Bob into making a decision immediately. It gives him space to consider the offer and ask questions if needed. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an initial offer. I'll need to be prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation.
* The success of this strategy will depend on Bob's valuation of the product and his willingness to negotiate. 
* I'll also need to consider the time value of money. The longer the negotiation takes, the more likely it is that I might be better off accepting John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a major loss for me.  Therefore, I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,700,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** The message explains the reasoning behind my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message concludes by inviting Bob to continue the negotiation, indicating I'm willing to find a middle ground. 

**Strategic Thinking:**

* I'm trying to gauge Bob's seriousness by seeing if he's willing to come up from his initial low offer. 
* If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to consider if I'm willing to further lower my price or if it's time to accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1700000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up from his initial offer,  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John at this point would be more profitable. However, there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1,450,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes that this is my ""absolute bottom line,"" creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message focuses on closing the deal, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and move forward.

**Strategic Thinking:**

* I'm taking a calculated risk by making a final offer. If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell to John for $1,500,000. 
* I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value while also demonstrating flexibility during the negotiation. 
* The tone of the message is firm but still respectful, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer without jeopardizing the relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1200000, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's clear we're too far apart in our valuations, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, selling to him is the most profitable option at this point.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
