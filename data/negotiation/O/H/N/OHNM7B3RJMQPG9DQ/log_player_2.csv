"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a significantly lower price, considering our long-standing relationship. I'm confident it will be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
