"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This anchors the negotiation higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,500,000 price tag provides ample space to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profit above John's guaranteed offer.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone helps foster a collaborative negotiation environment, even while aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While there's a risk Bob walks away, I'm willing to negotiate further, as his counteroffer suggests he's highly interested. John's offer provides a solid backup plan if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  I've lowered my price by $200,000, signaling flexibility but demonstrating I'm not willing to settle for a lowball offer. 
* **Holding Firm Above John's Offer:**  The $1,300,000 price ensures I'm still aiming for a profit margin beyond John's guaranteed purchase.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By mentioning the product's worth, I'm reminding Bob of its value and subtly anchoring the negotiation above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now crossed the $1,000,000 threshold, meaning I'll make a profit even if it's less than my initial target. Accepting avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or walking away in subsequent rounds. While I could push for more, the difference isn't significant enough to risk losing the sale altogether."
