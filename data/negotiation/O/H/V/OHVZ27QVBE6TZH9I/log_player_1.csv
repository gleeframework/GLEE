"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not ready to settle for Bob's offer. I believe the product has value and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount and shows my commitment to making this deal work. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $925,000? I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $925,000 is getting closer but I'm not quite ready to settle.  I'll try to see if I can get a bit more from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant concession from my original price and shows my willingness to compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure Bob is going to come up to my desired price.  It's getting a little risky to continue negotiating, as I could lose out on a sale to John.  Selling to John will guarantee me $1,000,000 which is a safe and reasonable outcome."
