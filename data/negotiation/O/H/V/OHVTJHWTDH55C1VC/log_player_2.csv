"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so you have plenty of time to work with Alice. Buying from John immediately would mean you get the product but at your maximum budget, leaving no room for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'm aiming for a price of $12,000 or lower.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I still have 7 rounds left, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
