"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $18000 initially. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15500, Bob. However, I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
