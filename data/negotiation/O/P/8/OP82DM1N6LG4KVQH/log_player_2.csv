"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is considerably below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see this transaction benefit us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,500,000.  He's better off trying to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's the most I can reasonably afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is within Bob's budget, and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds justifies accepting this offer."
