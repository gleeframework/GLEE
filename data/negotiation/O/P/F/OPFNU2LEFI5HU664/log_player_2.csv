"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than what another buyer is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob."
