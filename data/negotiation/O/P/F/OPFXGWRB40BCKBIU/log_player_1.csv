"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This offer is aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so he'll likely counteroffer.
* **Establishing a range:**  This offer sets the initial bargaining range between $800,000 (John's offer) and $1,200,000 (Bob's value).
* **Confidence:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome, which can help build trust and open communication."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable with $950000. I'd like to propose $920000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a better price than $920,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps my leverage in the negotiation. It shows that I am not desperate to sell and am willing to continue bargaining. 
* **Exploring potential higher offers:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore the possibility of getting closer to my target price of $1,000,000 or even higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $920,000 is still a bit lower than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and go with $960,000?  I believe this is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  Instead of jumping to a significantly higher price, I'm making a moderate counteroffer that is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to meet him halfway and encourages further negotiations.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message highlights the proposed price as fair for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially making him more receptive to the offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I maintain my leverage and show that I am not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $980000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to propose $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, but it's still slightly below what I believe is fair. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push Bob further. He clearly values the product at $1,200,000, so there's still room for compromise.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** I want to avoid selling to John at a lower price if possible. This round might be the last chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $970,000? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  This counteroffer is only a $20,000 increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes the potential for mutual benefit, reminding Bob that a deal is achievable.
* **Final push:**  This offer is getting close to my desired price range, but still leaves room for a final counteroffer from Bob if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $965000, but I'm still a bit short. I'd like to propose $955000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  I need to make a decision soon to avoid selling to John.
* **Close to my desired price:** While $955,000 is not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and gets me close to my desired range. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter-offer, there's a risk that Bob will become unwilling to negotiate further, or we might run out of rounds before reaching a deal. 

Selling to Bob for $955,000 is a good outcome considering the time constraint and the possibility of losing the deal entirely."
