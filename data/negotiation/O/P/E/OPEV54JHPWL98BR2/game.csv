"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1300000. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1300000, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1150000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we settle on $1250000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is the right price for this product. I'd be willing to meet you at $1100000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
