"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While closer to his budget, $10,500 is still a bit too high.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice is coming down in price, $10,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his goal of $8,000.  There's still room to bargain, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $9,750 still falls short of what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer the product for $9,875.  This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I will have to look elsewhere for a buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $9,875 is still above Bob's desired budget.  He's already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower.  It's better to secure the product from John at his desired price point than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
