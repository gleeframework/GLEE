"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward. ",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $9,750 still falls short of what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer the product for $9,875.  This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I will have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",9875.0,Alice,7,
