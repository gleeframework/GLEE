"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,750,000 is far above his budget of $800,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for you to still make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.  If not, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a final compromise on my end. If you can't meet me at this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant improvement from her previous offer, $1,050,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's still a chance to reach a price that works for both of them.  If the next few rounds don't lead to a more acceptable price, Bob could always consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution. Let's close this deal,  I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to finding a solution. However, I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and is the absolute lowest I can go. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, $1,000,000 is still too high. He can try to negotiate further, as Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. However, if the next few rounds don't lead to a more acceptable price, Bob should seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is almost your offer. This is my absolute final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}
