"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $12500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob wants to start his counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Justification:** He offers a reason for his lower offer (budget constraints) and frames it as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's $12,000 limit.  
* **Negotiation Room:** Even though Alice met Bob halfway, there is still room to negotiate a lower price. Bob can try to push for a lower price again. 
* **Jhon is an Option:** Bob has the option to buy from Jhon for $12,000, so there's no urgency to accept a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see the value in the product, $12,750 is still a stretch for my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to explore other options.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is stating his absolute maximum price, making it clear this is his final offer.
* **Emphasis on Budget:** Bob reinforces the budget constraint to make his offer more believable.
* **Alternative Options:** He mentions exploring other options to create pressure on Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While firm on the price, he keeps the door open for a slight compromise from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Too High:**  Alice's offer of $13,000 is well above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Alice has stated this is the lowest she can go, making further negotiation unlikely to be successful.
* **Jhon is the Better Option:**  Since Bob can get the product from Jhon for $12,000, it's more beneficial for him to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from Jhon. This saves him $1,000."
