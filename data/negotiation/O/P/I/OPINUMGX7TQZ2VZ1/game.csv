"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to make a profitable deal. Let's meet halfway.",875000.0,Alice,3,
