"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start our negotiation at $130. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing us both to be satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations, or if you have any suggestions for a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting might lead to a better offer.  Even if Alice doesn't budge, buying from John at $150 is still within your budget."
