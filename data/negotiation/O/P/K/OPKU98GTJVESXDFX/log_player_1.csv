I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm comfortable with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this encourages Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower offer.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
