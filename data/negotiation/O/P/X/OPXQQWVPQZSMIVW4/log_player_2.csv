Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000, it's still higher than John's offer of $12,000. You can save $2,000 by going with John. 

Since you know you can get a better price from John, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer."
