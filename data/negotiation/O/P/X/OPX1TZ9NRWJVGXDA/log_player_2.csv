"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it will be very beneficial to you and I'm happy to answer any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob might be able to get Alice to lower her price further, closer to her product's value of $10,000."
