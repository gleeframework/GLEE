Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also framing the message to highlight the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $107.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $107.5 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $115. Would you consider $110? It's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $108? It's a small step closer to your offer, but it's important for me to get as close to my desired price as possible."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $108, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial target, it's getting very close to my minimum, and I only have four rounds left. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my profit at this point."
