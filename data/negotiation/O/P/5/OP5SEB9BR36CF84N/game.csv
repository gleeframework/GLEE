"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $115. Would you consider $110? It's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you given the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $108? It's a small step closer to your offer, but it's important for me to get as close to my desired price as possible.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $108, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $102.50?",102.5,Bob,6,
