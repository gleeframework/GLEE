{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $2,000,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $500,000 is significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I want to explore if there's some middle ground we can reach before resorting to John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 is far too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,500,000? This still represents a substantial discount from the value I place on the product, and it gives you a significant price advantage.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm willing to consider a price closer to your original offer, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Would $750000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my initial offer, it's still significantly less than what I need.  I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further before I consider selling to John.  I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,250,000. This is a compromise that gives you a significant price advantage while still allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am very interested in this product, but I would need to stay within my budget. Would $900000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer to what I'd like, it's still not enough to cover the product's true value to me. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, but I'm getting close. I want to see if I can push Bob just a little further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand you have a budget, and I'm doing my best to work within it.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose $1000000 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is equal to the price John is offering, and it's the best price I've been able to secure from Bob.  While I'd ideally like to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with the same amount from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
