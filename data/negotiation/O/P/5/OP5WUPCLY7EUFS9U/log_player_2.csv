Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to offer $725,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to you.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with $740,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $740,000. I'm offering $732,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and it's a reasonable deal. Accepting this offer prevents the risk of the negotiation stalling and ensures I get the product at a significant discount from John's price."
