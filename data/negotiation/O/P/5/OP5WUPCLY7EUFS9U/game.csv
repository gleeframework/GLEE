"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $600,000 is a little low.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to offer $725,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you consider $740,000?",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with $740,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $740,000. I'm offering $732,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",732500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. Let's wrap this up - how about $736,000 and we have a deal?",736000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this done. I'm willing to meet you at $733,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",733000.0,Alice,7,
