Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's likely to negotiate down, so you're leaving room for a compromise.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This ensures you still make a profit.
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response:**  It frames the offer as a good deal and makes Bob feel like he's getting a bargain. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum value of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can offer a price closer to my target.  
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting immediately, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Gain more information:** Bob's counteroffer gives me a better understanding of his budget and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splits the difference:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterates value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value (even if it's not directly stated) encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and encouraging helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.

By offering $95, I'm balancing the need to earn as much as possible with the potential of a successful sale to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate my options, remembering that selling to John for $120 is always on the table."
