"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still too high. We want to get the price as low as possible. Rejecting the offer allows us to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still too high. There's still room for negotiation, and we want to try to get a price closer to our target of $900,000. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $975,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm counteroffering $1075000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still higher than our desired price point, but it's getting closer.  We've established a pattern of negotiation, and we can likely squeeze out a better price.  Continuing to counteroffer will hopefully lead to a more agreeable price within our remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1025000 is a compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise, especially given that we're down to our last few rounds. We've shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer allows us to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer.  While it's not our ideal price, it's a good deal considering the time constraints."
