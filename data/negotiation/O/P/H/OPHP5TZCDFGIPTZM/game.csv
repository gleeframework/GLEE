"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product has a higher value to you, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay up to $9500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $9500 is still too far below my asking price. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get closer to $12000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try $11000, and hopefully, we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $10500 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to me and its worth to you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $10500 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm happy to split the difference and offer you the product for $11250. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet you halfway at $11250. I am willing to pay $10750 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm happy to keep negotiating,  $10750 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to go down to $11000,  which is a significant concession on my part.  Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
