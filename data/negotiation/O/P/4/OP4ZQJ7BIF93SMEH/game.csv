"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I can't go below $9500. This still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000.
