"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,000,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice since there's a $100,000 difference between her offer and John's."
