"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant gain for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows you a substantial profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to me while still allowing you a substantial profit.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
