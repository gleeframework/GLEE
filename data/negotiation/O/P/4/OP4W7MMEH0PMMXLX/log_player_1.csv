Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to pay, and it's still less than what John is offering. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
