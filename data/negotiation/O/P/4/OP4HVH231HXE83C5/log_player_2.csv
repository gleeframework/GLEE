Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.

**Reasoning:** 

* Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* Her final offer is still $2,000 more than John's offer.
* While getting the product slightly below Alice's value would be ideal, it's highly unlikely she'll go that low given her firm stance.  

It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product at the best guaranteed price from John."
