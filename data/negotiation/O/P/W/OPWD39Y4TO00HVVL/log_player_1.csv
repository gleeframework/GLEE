Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There is room to move down in price if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's appealing to Bob:** $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. 

By starting at $13,000, you maximize your chances of reaching a good deal with Bob while still having a backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. 

Here's why:

* **You have leverage:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and he's already shown interest. 
* **John is a safety net:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John for $10,000, giving you a good fallback option.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, you might be able to reach a compromise closer to your initial price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $12,500, you're showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Fairness:**  Splitting the difference between your previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000) appears reasonable to both parties.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the benefits of the deal for both of you, emphasizing a ""win-win"" situation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12500. How about we meet in the middle at $12250? That's a good compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,250 is very close to your desired price point of $12,500.  Accepting his offer is the best option for the following reasons:

* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with the lower-value option of selling to John. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids further negotiation rounds, saving time and effort.
* **Small Difference:** The difference between $12,250 and your desired $12,500 is small enough that the potential gains from further negotiation might not outweigh the risks.

While you might still prefer $12,500, accepting Bob's offer at $12,250 is a good compromise that secures a strong price for you and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
