"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, you should reject Alice's offer of $20,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Alice is also trying to get the best price for her product, so your counteroffer needs to be realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You can try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your $15,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 
This offer is still lower than Alice's current price of $18,000 but is closer to what the product is worth to you. It is also a fair offer that Alice might consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still above your desired price.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $15,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting an even better price.  One more counteroffer might be enough to convince her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you are serious about making a deal. It's also a good compromise, as it's closer to Alice's latest offer and still within your budget. Hopefully, this will be enough to persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $16,500 is very close to your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and you could end up paying the same price as you would from John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product and still save some money compared to buying from John."
