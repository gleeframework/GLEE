Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $140. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but $80 is too low for me. I'm counteroffering at $120. Let me see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice is very unlikely to go below $120, and you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
