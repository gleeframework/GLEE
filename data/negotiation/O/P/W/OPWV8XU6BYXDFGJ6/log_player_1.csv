Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive but leaves room for profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing a Deal:** The price is significantly lower than John's offer, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  The price is still considerably higher than Bob's valuation, netting Alice a significant profit.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice has the security of John's guaranteed purchase at her minimum acceptable price."
