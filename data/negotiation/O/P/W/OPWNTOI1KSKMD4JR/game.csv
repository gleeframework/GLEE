"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,100,000 for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm able to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's worth.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,5,
