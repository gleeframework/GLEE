"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a chance she'll accept, but even if she doesn't, it gives me room to work up towards my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,100,000 for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice is coming down, but still way above my price range. I'll counteroffer again and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm able to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still staying under my $800,000 limit. It demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still seeking a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's worth.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice is still way above my budget.  It's time to walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
