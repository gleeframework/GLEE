Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident in the value of my product, so I'm willing to test the waters with a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a good profit while showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's last one. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm starting to get impatient.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. I'd rather have a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiation."
