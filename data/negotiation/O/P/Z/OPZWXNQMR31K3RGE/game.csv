"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $1,125,000? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a better deal than we had before. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
