Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a higher price, but keep John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'd like to suggest a price of $1,000,000 for your product. This aligns closer with what you're asking, while also staying within my budget. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount, and it saves me the time and energy of further negotiation."
