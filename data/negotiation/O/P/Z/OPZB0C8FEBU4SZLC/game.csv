,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Considering the value to me and the fact that I have other options, I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussion and my need to stay within budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
