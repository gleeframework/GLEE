"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,040,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both achieve our goals. Let's make this deal happen.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
