"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This way, we both get a fair deal and avoid further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $120 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's also the same price I could get from John.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation."
