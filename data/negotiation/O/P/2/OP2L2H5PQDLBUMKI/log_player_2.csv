"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what you'd pay John, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $120. There's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
