"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,500 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $11,000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit away. How about we meet at $11,000, and I'll throw in an additional $200 to sweeten the deal?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,500. If you could offer $11,200, we could finally strike a deal. It's a good price for you, and it's getting closer to what I'm aiming for.",11200.0,Alice,7,
