Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows her to start significantly higher to explore Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,200,000 price tag leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice the opportunity to still secure a price well above her minimum.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it (""unique product"", ""value and potential""). This framing subtly suggests the price is justified. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is potentially willing to pay a premium. If Alice knows Bob to be a very tough negotiator, she might adjust her starting price lower.
* **Market Information:** This assumes limited market information. If Alice knew other potential buyers existed and might pay even more, her strategy could shift."
