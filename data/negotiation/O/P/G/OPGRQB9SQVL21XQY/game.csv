"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity with incredible potential. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
