"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $70? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $70 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $85. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
