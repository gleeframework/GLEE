Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $70 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $85. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and it's better to secure the product at the best price available from John."
