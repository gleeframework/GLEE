"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $1150000. This price still reflects the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
