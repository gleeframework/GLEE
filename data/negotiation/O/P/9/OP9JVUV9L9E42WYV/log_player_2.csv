"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is under your $100 limit, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you're hoping she'll come back with a lower price closer to her $80 value. You're willing to risk buying from John for $100 if she doesn't budge."
