"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $11000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer $9000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,
