"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $14,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
