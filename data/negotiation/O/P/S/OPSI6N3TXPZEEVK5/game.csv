"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my original price. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? It's the best I can do, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
