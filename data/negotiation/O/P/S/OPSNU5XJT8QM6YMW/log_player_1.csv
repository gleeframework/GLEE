Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a decent margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob. I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer again, trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $85.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe this is a fair price, and hopefully, Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only $2 above my minimum acceptable price, it's still a good deal considering I might have to accept John's offer for $80.  It's better to get a little more than settle for the bare minimum."
