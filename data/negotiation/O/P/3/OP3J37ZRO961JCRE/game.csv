,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value is around $8,000 to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $12,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
