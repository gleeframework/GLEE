Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a strong initial point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** Highlighting the value to Bob can increase his interest in buying.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as an option provides security in case negotiations with Bob fail.  I can always sell to him for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to closing the deal:**  The message expresses a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal, while still ensuring a profit for myself."
