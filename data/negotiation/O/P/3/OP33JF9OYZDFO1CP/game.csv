"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to $6,000 to make this work.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I've found similar products for around $7,000, so I'd need you to get closer to that price for me to justify purchasing from you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done.",8250.0,Alice,5,
