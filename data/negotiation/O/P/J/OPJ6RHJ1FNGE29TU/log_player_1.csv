Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. I need to offer a price he's willing to pay, but also one that maximizes my profit.
* **My Minimum:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I won't accept anything less.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a $200,000 difference between Bob's value and my minimum.  Offering $900,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a good profit.

**If Bob accepts:** I make $900,000. 
**If Bob rejects:** I get $1,000,000 from John. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a slightly higher profit."
