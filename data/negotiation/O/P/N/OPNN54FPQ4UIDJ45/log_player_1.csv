Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, offering a slightly lower price to Bob might entice him to buy. This allows me to potentially make a quicker sale and still earn a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $14,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still represents a ""deal"" compared to John's guaranteed purchase price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The friendly tone of the message and the use of the word ""discounted"" suggest there might be some room for negotiation if Bob counters."
