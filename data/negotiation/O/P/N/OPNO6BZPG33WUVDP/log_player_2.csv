"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $15,000, which is Bob's maximum price. 
* **Strategy:**  There's no incentive to accept the offer immediately.  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always go to John if the deal with Alice falls apart. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Initial Offer:** Alice's offer of $15,000 was Bob's maximum price.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  Bob should aim for a significant reduction to start the negotiation.  $10,000 is a substantial drop, leaving room for potential compromise. This counter-offer is aggressive but provides a starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,500. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer, but Bob still has room to negotiate.
* **Strategy:** Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to keep trying to get a better deal without risking losing the product altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,500. This is closer to Bob's desired price but still leaves room for improvement.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** A counter-offer of $12,000  shows that Bob is serious about negotiating but also acknowledges that Alice is likely to meet him halfway.  This amount is reasonable, considering Alice's last offer and Bob's ultimate goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $13,000. This is a reasonable compromise and a good price for Bob.
* **Strategy:**  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob while saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate may lead to a slightly lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, or Bob may run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets a product he wants within his budget."
