{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves potential for a higher final price.
* **Openness:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a good deal.
* **Positive language:**  I use positive language (""amazing"", ""very interested"") to pique Bob's interest and create a favorable impression. 
* **No pressure:**  I'm not setting a deadline or making it seem like this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This allows Bob to consider the offer without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8000? I'm really keen on this product, and that's the maximum I can spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this would mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob might be at his limit, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which is still a decent amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm starting the counteroffer higher than Bob's initial offer, but still significantly lower than my first offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also indicates that I'm not willing to accept a price drastically lower than my minimum.
* **Middle ground approach:**  I'm suggesting a ""middle ground"" price of $13,000, framing it as a good deal for both of us. This makes it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive language:** I use phrases like ""appreciate your interest"" and ""good deal"" to maintain a positive tone.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize how the price is a ""good deal"" for both of us,  which can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. That's a significant amount for me, and I really want this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's possible he might go higher, especially since he's expressed strong interest in the product. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If negotiations break down, selling to John for $12,000 ensures I don't lose too much money.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum in the next round, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000? That's a small increase from your last offer and would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase, but closer to my minimum:**  I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still close enough to my minimum acceptable price that I'm comfortable with it.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I reiterate that this would be a ""great deal"" for both of us, reinforcing the idea of a fair compromise.
* **Positive tone and willingness to work:** I use positive language and express a desire to ""make this work"" to keep the negotiation amicable. 

This approach aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us while also staying within a range that benefits me.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $11000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product without going over budget. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **No significant increase:** Bob's offer is only a small increase from his previous offer, and it seems he's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Negotiation impasse:**  We've been going back and forth, and it's becoming clear that we might not reach an agreement.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation that might result in a lower price.

I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
