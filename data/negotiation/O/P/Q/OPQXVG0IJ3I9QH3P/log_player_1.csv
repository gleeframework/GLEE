Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

This would be a good deal for both of us,  allowing you to get a fair price and me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this.
