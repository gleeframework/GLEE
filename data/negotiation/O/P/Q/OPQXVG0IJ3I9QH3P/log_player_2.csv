"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. You can get a better deal. 
* You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a significant way off from my valuation of the product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,175,000?  This reflects the true value while still offering you a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

* There is still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* Rejecting her offer allows you to send another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to your desired price point."
