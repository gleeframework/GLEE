"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a significant way off from my valuation of the product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,175,000?  This reflects the true value while still offering you a substantial return on your investment.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a high valuation for the product, but $1,175,000 is still a bit much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us,  allowing you to get a fair price and me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
