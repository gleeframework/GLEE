"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,500,000. Would you consider reducing the price? I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
