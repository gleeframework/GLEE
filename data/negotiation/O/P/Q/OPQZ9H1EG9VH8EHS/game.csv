"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 might be too low. How about we meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $97 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $105. Would you consider $101?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point.",101.0,Alice,5,
