"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob's perceived value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making the offer more enticing.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better offer than $80 (selling to John), I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm again ending with a question to keep the conversation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 might be too low. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $97 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal I can get. I'm confident I can push for a higher price and will try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $97 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to $105. Would you consider $101?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 101}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain the compromise tone:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing that I'm willing to work with him, but also reaffirming my desire for a higher price.
* **Offer a small concession:** I'm only dropping the price by $4 from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm still committed to my original price point.
* **Focus on a fair deal:** I'm continuing to emphasize the fairness of the deal, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and preventing him from feeling pressured.
* **State a finality:**  I'm implying this is my best offer, encouraging Bob to accept to avoid further negotiation."
