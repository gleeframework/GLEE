"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is significantly below what I need to make this work. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This gives you a great price, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $1,300,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's a significant savings for me, and it's still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position and appreciate your continued negotiation.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000 for this product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. Let me know if you're willing to meet in the middle.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
