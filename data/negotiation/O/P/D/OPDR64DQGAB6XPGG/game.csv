"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,000? This reflects a more accurate price for the value it brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept anything less than $15,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true worth.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I can offer $13,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to make a decision soon.",13500.0,Bob,6,
