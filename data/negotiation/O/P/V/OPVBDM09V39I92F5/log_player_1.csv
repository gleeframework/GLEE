"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to settle for the minimum just yet. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount, but I'm also showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $160 is a significant improvement over his previous offer.  At this point, I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of getting a lower price."
