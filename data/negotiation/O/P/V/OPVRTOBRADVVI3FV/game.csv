"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession.
