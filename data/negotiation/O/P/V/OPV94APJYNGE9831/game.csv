"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in your product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000. That's a substantial amount for you, and it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
