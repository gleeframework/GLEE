"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to her, there's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in your product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000. That's a substantial amount for you, and it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is closer to my counteroffer of $900,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the offer. It's a good price for me, and I want to avoid the risk of her rejecting my next counteroffer or going back up in price."
