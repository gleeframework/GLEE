Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $15,000 is my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 18000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $16500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise, and it's much closer to my minimum than $15,000. I'll accept his offer."
