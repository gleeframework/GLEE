Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to position the product as highly desirable and justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on my knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, I might adjust my approach."
