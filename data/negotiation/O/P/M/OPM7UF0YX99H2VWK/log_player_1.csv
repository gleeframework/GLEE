Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing further, of course."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and it allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount.  I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer already reflects a significant discount on its true worth to you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle and settle at $1,087,500.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I believe the product is worth pushing for a higher amount. I'll continue the negotiation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,106,250."",
""product_price"": 1106250
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go a little higher, but $1,106,250 is still above what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,091,875.  That's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,091,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,091,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or the negotiation stalling altogether."
