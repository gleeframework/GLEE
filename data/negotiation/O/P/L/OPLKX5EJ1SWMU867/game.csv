With that said, I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $980,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I see the value, $980,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $940,000?",940000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I can offer you a price of $960,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",960000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $955,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",955000.0,Alice,7,
