"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit and enhance your business operations. Given its exceptional value and capabilities, I estimate its worth to be significantly higher than $1,000,000 to you. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $1,250,000. This offer includes a comprehensive warranty and a dedicated support package to ensure smooth integration and optimal performance within your organization. I am confident that this investment will pay off in numerous ways, contributing to your company's growth and success. Please let me know if you have any questions or require further information. I look forward to discussing this opportunity with you further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* However, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John if you reject Alice's offer.
* There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.  Alice is likely to come back with a lower offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation to avoid losing the sale."
