Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a nice round number that might make Bob more likely to accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I think I can get more. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 more than what John is willing to pay. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John and I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
