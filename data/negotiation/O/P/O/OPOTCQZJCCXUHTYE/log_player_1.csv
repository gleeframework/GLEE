Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is great, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $11,000? That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
