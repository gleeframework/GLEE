"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $180. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By saying I'm open to offers, I'm encouraging Bob to counter without making it seem like I'm inflexible.
* **Setting a Foundation:** Stating my minimum desired price gives Bob a starting point and helps frame the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's tempting to take the $140, I'm committed to getting at least $150. 
* **More Rounds Left:** I have plenty of rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to a deal that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a bit low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** I'm lowering my price from $180, showing flexibility. However, I'm still above my minimum to maintain my profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even at the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

* **Securing a Deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
