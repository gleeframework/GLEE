"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my current budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm still open to discussing further.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1300000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1150000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the sale at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort in meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still slightly beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the closest we can get to a mutually beneficial solution.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
