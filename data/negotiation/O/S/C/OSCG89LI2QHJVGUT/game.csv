"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still hoping to land somewhere between our two numbers.  Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $14,250. This is a fair price that I'm confident you'll find reasonable, considering the value of the product.",14250.0,Alice,7,
