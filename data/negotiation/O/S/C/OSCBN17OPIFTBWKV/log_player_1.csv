Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $800,000. This allows her to be more ambitious with her initial offer to Bob."
