"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You can try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price or simply buy from John."
