Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its features and benefits."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $120 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Above our Minimum:** It's crucial that any offer exceeds our minimum selling price of $150 to John. This strategy ensures we maximize our potential profit."
