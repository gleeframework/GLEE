"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,300,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's desired price point.  He's still better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get the price down even further.  He's still better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate, especially since Alice has stated this is her final offer.  He can use this as leverage to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,150,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and the negotiation is getting closer to his maximum budget.  While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, $1,225,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's better to secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, even though he'd prefer to save even more money.  At this point, the risk of not getting the product at all is greater than the potential reward of trying to get a lower price from Alice."
