"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I believe you'll be happy with this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your maximum budget and is not a good deal."
