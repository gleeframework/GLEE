"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $13,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price, and closer to his valuation than mine. I have some room to negotiate, but holding out might net me a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle, but his latest offer is still less than I can get from John. It's time to push a little closer to my fallback option.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000. I'm still willing to work with you, but I need a price that makes sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
