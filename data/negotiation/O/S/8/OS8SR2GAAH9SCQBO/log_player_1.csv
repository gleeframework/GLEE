"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential compromise.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This price is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, which gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer is a test to see how willing Bob is to negotiate and what his initial response might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. 
* **Time to counter:**  Bob is showing interest by making a counteroffer, and I have the opportunity to increase the price further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, there's a chance I could potentially get even closer to that price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my goal:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit.
* **Testing for compromise:** By offering $975,000, I'm gauging Bob's willingness to meet halfway. If he accepts, I'm closer to my target price. If he rejects, I can adjust my next offer accordingly.
* **Staying within the negotiation zone:** It's important to avoid becoming too rigid. This offer keeps the negotiation dynamic and increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is offering a higher price than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  We've been making progress, and I believe there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** I have more rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  If I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $950,000, which is the midpoint between Bob's latest offer and my previous counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While this offer is still below my minimum, it's closer to the price Bob is willing to pay.  I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping to close the deal while still securing a good price. 
* **Limited time:** We're nearing the halfway point in our negotiation rounds, so I'm trying to reach a deal before the pressure mounts to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, $900,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Close to a decision point:** We are getting close to the point where I need to consider selling to John.  However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob.
* **Time to counter:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating for a couple more rounds, hoping to either push Bob closer to my target price or reach a point where I'm comfortable selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and pressure:** I'm offering $925,000, which is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This shows a willingness to meet halfway while simultaneously applying pressure to close the deal.
* **Time is ticking:** With only a few rounds left, I need to be more assertive in pushing for a favorable price.
* **Evaluating risk:** While this offer is closer to Bob's offer than my previous ones, it's still within a range where I'm comfortable if Bob accepts. If he rejects, I'm prepared to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in the 8th round, and we have only 2 rounds left. If we don't reach a deal, I have to sell to John. 
* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000 and also below my current offer of $925,000. It is unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer in the next round.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum goal. While I would prefer a higher price, it's too risky to continue with Bob at this point.

Considering the limited time and Bob's consistent reluctance to meet my desired price point, I believe it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
