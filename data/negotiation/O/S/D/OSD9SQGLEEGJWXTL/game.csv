"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we consider $950000 for the product?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $950000 is still a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we consider $1100000 for the product? It's a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but also takes into account your budget concerns. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1050000 as a potential agreement point?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1080000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm willing to make this one last concession to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. Given your latest offer, I'd like to propose $1060000 as a potential agreement point. This is a significant improvement from my initial offer and should allow us to close the gap while staying within my budget constraints.",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1060000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get at least $1120000. It's the last concession I'm willing to make, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.
