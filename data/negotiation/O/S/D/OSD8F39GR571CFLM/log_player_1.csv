Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

Round 4

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a decent price. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to continue negotiating for a better deal."
