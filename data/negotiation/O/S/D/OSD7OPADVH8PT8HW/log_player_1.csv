Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if the price goes down.
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state why my price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the phrase ""given its value"" hints at additional benefits or factors Bob might not be immediately considering.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a backup allows me to be more confident in my initial offer. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I gain a significant profit.
2. **Open Negotiation:** If Bob counters, we can potentially settle on a price higher than $12,000.
3. **Secure a Sale:** Worst case, Bob rejects, and I still sell to John at my minimum."
