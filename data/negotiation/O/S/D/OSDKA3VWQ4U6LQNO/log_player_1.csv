Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I'm looking forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product is valuable, but the price needs to work for me too.  How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see this deal closer to $700,000.  How about $725,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000.
