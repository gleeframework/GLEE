"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I'm looking forward to your response.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product is valuable, but the price needs to work for me too.  How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see this deal closer to $700,000.  How about $725,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a good deal for me.
