"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90? I'm very interested in the product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet at $95. I'm confident that this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $105. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's split the difference at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us and it will allow us to close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
