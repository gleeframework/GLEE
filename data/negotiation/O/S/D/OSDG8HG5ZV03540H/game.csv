"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,150,000 is a significant offer, I believe the true value of the product is closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,225,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
