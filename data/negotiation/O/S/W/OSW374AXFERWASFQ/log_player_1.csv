Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John.  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding John's offer.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but not exorbitantly so. It leaves space for me to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value. This can make Bob more receptive, even if he intends to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes some unknown information about Bob's willingness to pay. If I had additional information (like Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product), I could tailor my offer more precisely."
