# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at an exclusive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation and budget, how about we agree on $13,000 for the product? I believe this strikes a good balance between value and price.

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can likely negotiate further and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $12,900 as the price for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,900 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  I'm not sure if I can negotiate further, and it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer again.  John is offering the product at my target price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
