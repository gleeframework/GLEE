"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your valuation and budget, how about we agree on $13,000 for the product? I believe this strikes a good balance between value and price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $13,000.  How about we split the difference and do $12,750?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $12,900 as the price for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your budget.",12900.0,Alice,5,
