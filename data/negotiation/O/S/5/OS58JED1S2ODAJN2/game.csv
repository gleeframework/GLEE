,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $950,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair valuation.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in your vision for this product, so I'm offering you a final price of $1,000,000. This is my best offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
