"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your budget considerations, the product's value is firmly above $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm afraid $1,125,000 is still above my current budget.  Would you consider $1,080,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
