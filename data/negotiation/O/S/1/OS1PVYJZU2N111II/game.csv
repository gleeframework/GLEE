"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my budget. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $900000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1050000. This price still offers you a considerable gain while ensuring a fair return for me. Let's continue to work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $950000 is closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute minimum I can accept. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
