"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a one-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good idea to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is a significant discount from my initial price.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. If you're serious about selling this product, let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500.  This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  While there is potential for further negotiation, it's not guaranteed that you'll be able to get the price down to your desired level. Given that John is willing to sell you the product for $8,000, it's more financially advantageous to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
