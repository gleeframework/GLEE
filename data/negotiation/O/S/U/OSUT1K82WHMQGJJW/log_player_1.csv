This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value proposition and urgency, making it more compelling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum of $15,000. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. If you're serious about selling this product, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While $10,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value and you're willing to negotiate further."
