{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to go down to $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better price for both of us. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or even a rejection."
