"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for significant room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum of $800,000.  I'm hoping this will gauge Bob's interest and potential budget for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I believe there's still potential to get a better price. It's only round 2, and I have several rounds to work with before I have to consider selling to John.  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good amount over my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $800,000.  With John as a backup, I have some leeway to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $850,000. This is a compromise, offering Bob a price that's closer to his offer while still being above my minimum and John's offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to both parties and lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are getting progressively lower. While I could continue, there's a risk that he'll continue to lower his offers, potentially forcing me to accept a price lower than my minimum. 

John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the deal with John."
