Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is too low and far below my minimum. However, there's room for negotiation.
