""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,400,000. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price reflects its value fairly."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Negotiation and understanding the buyer's motivations are key in real-world scenarios."
