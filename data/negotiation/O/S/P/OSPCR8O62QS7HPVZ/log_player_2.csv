"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still more than the product is worth to him. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential you see in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he'll continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
