"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 was a bit low, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
