"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  There's no reason to accept a deal that bad when a better option exists."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to pay more when a better option exists."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering I can buy the product from John for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation when a sure thing exists."
