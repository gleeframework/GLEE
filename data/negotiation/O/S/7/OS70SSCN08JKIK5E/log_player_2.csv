"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $18,000. This is a significant difference. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate and hopefully reach a better price. 
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it while also giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I have in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target:** While $14,000 is a lower price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There are more rounds available, and Alice has shown some willingness to come down. You can likely get a better price.
* **John is your safety net:** If the negotiation falls apart, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions, and it's the highest I'm able to go at this point."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000, which is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Despite your counteroffers, Alice has increased her asking price. This indicates a stalemate.
* **John's offer is your best option:** John is offering the product at your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice if you can get the product from John for a price you're comfortable with. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price from Alice. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John."
