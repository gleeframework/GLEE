"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $1,750,000 is still below my minimum price ($1,500,000), giving me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging in my message to build a rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we aim for $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There is still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,550,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Above Minimum:**  I'm starting my counteroffer above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,550,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, making it more appealing.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I remind Bob that the price is still a ""great deal"" for him, emphasizing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to suggest $1,450,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a deal. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffers:** While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk a stalemate.

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,450,000."
