"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $125.  I believe this is still a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on it.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. How about we try $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
