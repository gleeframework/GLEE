"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a bit more in line with my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest and understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to compromise, though, and offer the product to you for $950,000. This price still reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable return on my investment. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that balances both our interests. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $875,000 is still unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to try and reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, but it's the closest I can come while still meeting my needs. I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.  Please consider this carefully, as this is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final compromise, and I'm grateful for the offer. However, $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm offering $880,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I hope you can consider this and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
