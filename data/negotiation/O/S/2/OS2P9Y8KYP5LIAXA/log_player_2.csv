"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still slightly out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $10,800. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $10,700. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, she's still not willing to go below $10,700. I'm running out of rounds and I'm comfortable with John's price of $10,000. It's better to secure the product at a price I'm happy with than risk continuing negotiations and potentially losing out."
