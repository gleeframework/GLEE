I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further.  However, I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to him, considering its value to me and the fact that John is willing to pay $1,200,000."

While Bob's offer is enticing, I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price, especially considering John's willingness to pay $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly, but I'm willing to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum price point.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,220,000.  While I was hoping to get a bit more, the risk of further negotiation and a potential loss in time and deal isn't worth it, especially since John's offer is only $20,000 higher."
