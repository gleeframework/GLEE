Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair offer that reflects the significant value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Ideally, I want to get as close to that price as possible.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John. Any offer accepted by Bob above this is a win.

This strategy aims to secure the maximum possible profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving room for potential negotiation."
