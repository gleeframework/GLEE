Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, and this offer represents a great value.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  We don't want to price it too high and risk Bob rejecting the offer, leading you to sell to John for $10,000.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit."
