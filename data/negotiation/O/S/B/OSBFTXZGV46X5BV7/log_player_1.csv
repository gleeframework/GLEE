{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for him to negotiate down without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a fair offer, I'm looking for something closer to $9,000.  Perhaps we can split the difference and agree on $8,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $8,500. How about we meet at $8,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, and it's a good deal for both of us.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
