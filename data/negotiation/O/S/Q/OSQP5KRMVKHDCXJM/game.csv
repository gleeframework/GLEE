"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value and I'm confident in its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,295,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",1295000.0,Bob,4,
