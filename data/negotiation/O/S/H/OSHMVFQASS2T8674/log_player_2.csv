"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $12,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. You want to save money, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to compromise, her offer is still above your desired price point. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,500. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise on my end. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. Since you can buy the product from John for that price, continuing to negotiate with Alice makes sense. It's possible you might get her down to your price or find a middle ground that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $10,250 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. Since you have the option to buy the product from John at your target price, it's the most logical decision to go with John.  You've successfully negotiated with Alice and got her down to a price close to your budget, but it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
