"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential for your business.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. This price reflects its value and allows for a good margin for you. Let's chat about it further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with $1,200,000.  This would still give you a solid profit and leave room for us both to benefit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to you justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? This price gives us both a good deal and allows for a successful partnership. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,
