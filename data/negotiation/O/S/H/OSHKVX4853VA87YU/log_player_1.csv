Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $850,000.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000), I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $800,000.
