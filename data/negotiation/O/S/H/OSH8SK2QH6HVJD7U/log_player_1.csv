Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still allows for some negotiation space.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while presenting the offer as a win-win situation. 
* This initial offer leaves room for counteroffers while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to assess his counteroffer and potentially make further concessions while keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind. 
* I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that significantly undervalues the product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that reflects the value of the product while showing flexibility in the negotiation process. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $900,000 without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest in acquiring it. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000** is a compromise price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* This counteroffer shows flexibility and a desire to reach a deal, while still protecting my interests. 

I believe this counteroffer will encourage Bob to consider a higher price, while also being reasonable enough to avoid a complete impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a higher offer than Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to budge further, and continuing to negotiate will likely lead to a stalemate. 

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm confident that I'll get a better deal with John, and it's important to prioritize maximizing my profit, even if it means missing out on a deal with Bob."
