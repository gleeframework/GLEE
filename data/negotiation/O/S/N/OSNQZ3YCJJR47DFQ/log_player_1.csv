Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** Bob stands to gain $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) if he buys at your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible while still ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy from you instead of you going to John.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain.
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, you create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  The message highlights the ""value and potential"" to remind Bob why he's interested.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You might adjust your price slightly up or down depending on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
