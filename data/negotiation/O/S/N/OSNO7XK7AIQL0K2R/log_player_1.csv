"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully land a deal closer to my desired price. 
* **Reasoning:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer seriously.

**Remember:** I'm aiming to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I can walk away with $1,500,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1750000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000,  I have a better option with John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price or walk away with the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting the value of the product to you.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering Strategically:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to emphasize why this price is justified. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll have a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to make a new counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1300000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less than that, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep negotiating or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a good compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and gives me a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm offering a price that's in between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again stressing the value of the product to both of us, justifying my price point. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes the potential for a ""good compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1325000, which I believe is a fair and final offer.  This price allows us both to benefit from the deal, and I'm confident it's a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to compromise on my bottom line, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John.  I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob or move on to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still not a viable price for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, which is closer to your final offer.
