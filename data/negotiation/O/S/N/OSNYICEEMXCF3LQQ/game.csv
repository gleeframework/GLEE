,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1100000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think it's a bit steep, but I'm confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. This is my best offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to propose a price of $950000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think $1025000 is the lowest I can go. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make for the right buyer, and I believe you're that buyer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose a price of $925000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your commitment. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this price. I believe it's a fair compromise that balances my needs and your budget.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a price of $925000 again, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $980000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I expect you to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a price of $900000 one last time. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,10,
