Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This also allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more for this product. Would you consider paying $88? It's a great price for the value you'll get!"", ""product_price"": 88} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can come up with a compromise. How about $86 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $2 less than my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer.  Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point, securing a sale and a price that is close to my desired minimum."
