"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. My research indicates it could be worth up to $1,500,000 in your hands. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from its potential value. This is a unique opportunity that you won't want to miss. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.**  This is a good price, but you can do better. 
* **You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000.**  This means you have some wiggle room.
* **John is willing to sell for $1,500,000.** This is your fallback option. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to either lower her price or risk losing the sale to John. There's a good chance she'll come back with a counter-offer closer to your target price."
