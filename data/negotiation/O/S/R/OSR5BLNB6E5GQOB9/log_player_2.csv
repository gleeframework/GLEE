{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since you're trying to save money, it's always worth trying to negotiate.  You've got 10 rounds, so there's no rush to accept right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's a bit of a gamble, but it could lead to a much better price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $135 is still a bit high, and I'm not feeling rushed.  I'd like to try to get closer to my $120 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a good price.  It's a compromise that could be more appealing to her than the $120 offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly coming down in price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm getting closer to Alice's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  $128 is a middle ground between my last offer and her latest one. If she accepts, I've saved a decent amount. If she rejects, I might need to consider buying from John in the next round."
