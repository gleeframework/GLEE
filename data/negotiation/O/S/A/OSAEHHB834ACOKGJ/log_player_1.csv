"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** The initial price offered often sets a psychological anchor. By starting high, you anchor the negotiation around a higher value.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's value strengthens your position. 

While this initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it allows for a strategic negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still significantly below our target price. We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps us in the game while encouraging Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While your offer is appealing, the true value of this product to your specific business operations warrants a closer look.  To keep this moving, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're making a significant concession to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reinforces that the product's value to Bob's business specifically justifies a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Maintaining Ground:** We're still significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum, providing room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my business needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now below John's guaranteed price. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob's offer decreasing further, or reaching a stalemate. Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum desired outcome without further risk or time investment."
