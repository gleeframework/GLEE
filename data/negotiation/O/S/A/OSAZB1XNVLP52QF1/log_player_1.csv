Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while ensuring you get a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  It's worth trying to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate but also standing your ground. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable price."
