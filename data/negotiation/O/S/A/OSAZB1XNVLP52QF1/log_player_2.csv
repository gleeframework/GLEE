"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can still save money by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  The goal is to get the price as low as possible, and $1,200,000 is still too high compared to your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point for a counter-offer, showing Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. It's also within your budget, making it a safe move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will refuse to budge or even increase the price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a price that is within your budget and substantially lower than John's price. There is a good chance you won't get a better price, and the risk of losing the deal with Alice is not worth it."
