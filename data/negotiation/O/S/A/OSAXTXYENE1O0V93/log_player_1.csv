I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to capitalize on any potential value Bob might see in the product, while still securing a profit beyond my minimum. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
