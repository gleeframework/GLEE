Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I'm confident will benefit you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still providing you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000 even? That would make it a much easier decision for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's trying to get the product for his maximum valuation.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking getting a lower offer when I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John."
