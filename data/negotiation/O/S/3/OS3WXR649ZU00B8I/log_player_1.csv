"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for your product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially close the deal at a better price.  Selling to John is a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for your product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for me and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. While I could reject and counter, there's no guarantee Bob will accept, and I'd be wasting a round.  Since John is willing to pay the same amount,  accepting Bob's offer is the best choice."
