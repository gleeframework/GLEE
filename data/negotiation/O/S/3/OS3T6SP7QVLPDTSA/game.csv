"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if you're willing to consider it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the slight reduction in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $950,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand my position.",925000.0,Bob,4,
