"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll get a lot of use out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $100.  Since you have a backup option of buying from John for the same price, you can reject Alice's offer and still get the product. This gives you the opportunity to see if a better deal might come along."
