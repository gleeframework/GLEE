"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you were willing to come down to $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, $10000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $17,000 is better than $20,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which I think is a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $15500? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum value. He should reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
