Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value highly.  Given its worth, I propose a price of $925,000. This represents a significant saving for you compared to its true value.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation."
