Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Bob is more likely to counter-offer closer to your asking price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for you to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects your offer, you're in a great position. You have a guaranteed buyer in John. This strong fallback position gives you leverage in the negotiation."
