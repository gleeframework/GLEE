Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive enough to Bob while maximizing your potential gain.  You need to balance getting a deal done with Bob against the guaranteed sale to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have strong interest from other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still offers him a substantial saving compared to your alternative offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a reason for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer.  You could adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to pursue a deal with Bob."
