"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for the sale.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a significant step down from my initial ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your position.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. While I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle, I must respectfully decline your latest proposal. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $975,000. I hope this figure will be more acceptable for both parties.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as it represents a considerable compromise on my end. If this doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued patience and understanding. I've reviewed your latest offer carefully and am prepared to counter with $985,000. This figure aims to bridge the gap while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",985000.0,Bob,6,
