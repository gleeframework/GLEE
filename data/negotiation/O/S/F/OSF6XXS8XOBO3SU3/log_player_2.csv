# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum price point. I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer again and we'll end up at a stalemate. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of a deal falling through."
