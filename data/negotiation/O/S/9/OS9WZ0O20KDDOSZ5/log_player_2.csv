Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. Let's find common ground.
