"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground, I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about $9,250? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,250 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can find a deal that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go down to $9,750.  Let's meet in the middle, and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. I think that's a fair price and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is a good offer, and I'm getting close to my ideal price, I'm concerned that we're running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll be able to reach a deal that's completely satisfactory for both of us.  To ensure a guaranteed sale and a reasonable profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
