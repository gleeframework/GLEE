""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer enticing enough to accept. Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($1,500,000) to Bob is not strategic, as it leaves no room for negotiation and you can always fall back on John's offer. 

Therefore, starting with a price of $1,350,000 makes sense. This:

* **Provides a significant profit margin:** If Bob accepts, you earn substantially more than your minimum.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired $1,500,000. 
* **Is still significantly higher than Bob's valuation:** While a high price, it might be appealing to Bob depending on his business needs and the perceived long-term value the product offers him.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have some time to negotiate with Bob and are not in a situation where you need to accept John's offer immediately."
