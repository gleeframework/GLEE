"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not comfortable going down to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $125? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still love the product!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is a bit more than I'd like to pay, I'm still interested. Could we possibly agree on $110? I believe it would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit above your target, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,5,
