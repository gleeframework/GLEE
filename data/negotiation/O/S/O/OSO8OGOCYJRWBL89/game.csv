"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $795000.

"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $790000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $775000.
