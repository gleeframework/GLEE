Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my absolute top offer is $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is my final offer, and it's the absolute most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has made it clear he won't go above $13,500.  While I could counter, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000."
