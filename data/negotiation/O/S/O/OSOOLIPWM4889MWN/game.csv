"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my absolute top offer is $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is my final offer, and it's the absolute most I can afford.",13500.0,Bob,6,
