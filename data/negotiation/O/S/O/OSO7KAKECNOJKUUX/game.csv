"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. It's still a great value for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is still a great value for you. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",15500.0,Alice,5,
