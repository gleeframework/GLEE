"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob! However, $115 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $130, which is $122.50. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,5,
