Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $149. I think you'll find it a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While John offers a guaranteed $150, aiming slightly lower with Bob might entice him.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so offering it at or below that price is pointless. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob expresses interest but hesitates at the initial price.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and getting a guaranteed $150 from John) with the potential of earning slightly more from Bob."
