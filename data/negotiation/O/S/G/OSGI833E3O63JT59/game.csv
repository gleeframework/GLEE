"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm happy to compromise further, but $9,800 isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $10,100 for the product. This way, we both get a good deal. What do you say?",10100.0,Alice,5,
