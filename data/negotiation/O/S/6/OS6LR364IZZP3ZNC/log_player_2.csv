"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as there is significant room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to start with his maximum budget, $10,000, as a counteroffer. This is a bold move, but it's a strong starting point for negotiation.  Alice might not accept it, but it clearly sets Bob's limit and establishes a foundation for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. Since Bob has a maximum of 10 rounds, and he has already made one counteroffer, he has 8 rounds left. This gives him some time to negotiate further. If Alice continues to be stubborn, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly.  He's offering $12,000, which is still well below Alice's original price, and  it shows that he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget.  He's hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice, and they can start to converge towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, and he has limited rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can reach a more agreeable price.  He's only at round 5, so he has 5 more rounds to potentially make a deal with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time he is getting closer to Alice's last offer. Offering $14,000 demonstrates that he is serious about reaching a deal and is willing to meet Alice halfway. With only 4 rounds left, it's important to try and close the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's comfort zone, and he has only 3 rounds left.  With so little time remaining, it's worth trying to negotiate further and see if they can reach a compromise. If this round doesn't lead to a deal, Bob might need to seriously consider buying from John in the next round to avoid losing too much time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob is taking a calculated risk.  He's increasing his offer to $15,000, which is closer to Alice's last offer. This is a significant jump, showing his commitment to making a deal.  He believes Alice might accept this, as it is closer to her value of $15,000 for the product. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely need to buy from John in the final round to avoid running out of time."
