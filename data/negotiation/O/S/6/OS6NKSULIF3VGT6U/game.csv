"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $950,000? This is a good compromise, and I think it's a deal that benefits both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
