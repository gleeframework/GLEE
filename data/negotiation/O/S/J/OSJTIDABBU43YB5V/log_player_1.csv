Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($850,000 vs. $800,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob. This helps him see the offer as potentially worth it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I use language like ""Let me know your thoughts"" to signal I'm open to discussion and potential counteroffers. 

**Reasoning:**

By starting high and framing the offer around value, I create a better negotiating position. If Bob rejects, I can still work with him, or I have the option to sell to John for my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. Accepting it would mean taking a loss.  

**Reasoning:**

While I could settle for $750,000, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I have the security of John's offer to fall back on if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer of $825,000. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to convince him to accept the offer. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with ""What do you say?"" to keep the conversation open and encourage further dialogue.

**Reasoning:**

By counter-offering at $825,000, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This allows for further negotiation while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I think we can agree on a price closer to $800000. Would you be open to discussing this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting it would secure a sale and ensure I don't lose out on any potential profits.

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or me needing to sell to John for the same price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice.  This ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
