Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $400,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's offer creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** The price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, the message subtly emphasizes the product's potential, suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
