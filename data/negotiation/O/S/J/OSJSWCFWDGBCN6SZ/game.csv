"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value and potential for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
