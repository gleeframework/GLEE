I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This strategy is based on the following:

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** By aiming high, I have the potential to earn a much larger profit if Bob is willing to pay.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 provides me with a floor. If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the full $2,000,000, my initial offer establishes a high starting point for potential negotiation.  

Let's see if Bob bites!"
