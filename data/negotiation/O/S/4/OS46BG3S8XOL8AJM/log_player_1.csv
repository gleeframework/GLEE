Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I agree this product has potential, but $950,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a purchase price of $700,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.
