Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm offering it to you for $19,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Target:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 gives you room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is higher for Bob. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially justify the price based on his perceived value (e.g., faster delivery, additional services, etc.). 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and uses phrases like ""I believe"" and ""Let me know what you think,"" signaling that you're open to discussing the price.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging that Bob has the option to refuse and that you have a fallback option."
