"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7250.0,Alice,3,
