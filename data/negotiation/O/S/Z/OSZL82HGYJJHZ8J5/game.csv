"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but we need to find a more agreeable middle ground. How about we consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,150,000, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
