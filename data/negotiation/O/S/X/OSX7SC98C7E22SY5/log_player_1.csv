Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $120. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring a profitable sale regardless of his decision."
