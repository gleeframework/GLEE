"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you can make a decision quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1400000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You should try to negotiate further to see if you can bring the price down closer to your target. There's still room for negotiation, and you want to avoid overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $1200000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. Even though she's moving closer to your desired price, you've already had several rounds of negotiation and there's a risk of getting stuck in a loop.  John offers a safe and guaranteed price that fits your budget. It's better to secure the product from John rather than continue to gamble with Alice."
