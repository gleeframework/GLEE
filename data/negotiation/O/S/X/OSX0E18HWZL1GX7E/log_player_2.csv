{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to save as much money as possible.
* I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* This is a bold move, but it might incentivize Alice to negotiate further.
* If Alice rejects, I still have 8 rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is showing some flexibility by lowering her price from $1,200,000 to $1,250,000.
* I believe a price of $1,000,000 is a fair compromise, considering both of our limits.
* This offer is within my budget and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* If Alice rejects, I still have 6 rounds to reach a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,300,000 is still above my desired limit. 
* I have 5 rounds remaining and want to see if I can push for a better price.
* I'm confident that I can get a lower price by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $1,300,000, showing some flexibility. I believe a price of $1,100,000 is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my target price and likely still profitable for Alice.
* This offer also leaves some room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my target without exceeding my budget.
* If Alice rejects, I still have 4 rounds to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is still above my target price of $1,500,000. 
* I have 3 rounds left to negotiate and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* It's still worth it to reject the offer and make a counter-offer to see if I can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but her offer of $1,350,000 is still too high.
* I am willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is closer to her desired price but still within my budget.
* With only two rounds remaining, I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might lead to a successful negotiation.
* If Alice rejects, I'll still have one final round to make a decision, and I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.
* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my target price of $1,500,000.
* I have no guarantee that Alice will accept my counteroffer in the next round, and I'm already close to my limit.
* It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, as this is the last round and I'm guaranteed to get the product."
