"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob than $800,000, and I'm hoping to leverage that in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better deal with Bob. However, if the negotiation drags on, I can always fall back on John's offer for $1,000,000. I will continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly throughout the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and not as high as John's offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to potentially get closer to my desired price point.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at a lower price.
* **Negotiate further:** I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob, especially considering his interest in the product. 

**Next Round:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still below my initial offer. I will be mindful of the remaining rounds and the time pressure."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it very worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, demonstrating flexibility, but still leaves me with a substantial profit.
* **Message:**  I am reaffirming the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the discount I am offering.  I am using language that reinforces the potential benefits for him while maintaining my position.

**Strategy:**

* **Meet in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not giving up too much. I'm aiming to find a compromise that satisfies both of us.
* **Maintain urgency:** I'm using language that suggests I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to wait forever for Bob. This can encourage him to make a decision quickly.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I will consider reducing the price further, but I will remain mindful of John's offer and the time remaining in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my ideal price and only slightly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain the negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob, especially considering the value he places on the product. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only six rounds left, time is becoming a factor, but I'm not desperate to close the deal at this price.

**Next Round:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $950,000 and my previous offer of $1,100,000. I'll aim for a compromise while still maintaining a comfortable profit margin."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm going to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, showing I'm committed to finding common ground. It's also a price that's significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the value to Bob, while also subtly conveying a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm aiming for a compromise to avoid a stalemate.  
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and highlighting the benefits of the deal.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm using language that suggests it's time to come to an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully closed the deal at a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer, considering the remaining time and the potential for a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is only $25,000 more than John's offer. Given that we're in round 6, time is becoming a critical factor.  The chances of getting a significantly better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds seem slim, and the risk of a prolonged negotiation isn't worth it. 

**Strategy:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only four rounds remaining, it's crucial to make a decision that secures a profit. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer provides a reliable and safe guarantee, and it's only slightly lower than Bob's current offer. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and guarantee a profit of $1,000,000 than to risk a lower price or a stalemate with Bob."
