"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  This initial offer also shows my willingness to sell. Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110?  That's still a great deal for a product this valuable."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer.  I still have a few rounds left and I don't want to sell to John for less than I feel the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm open to continuing to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $115?  This is a fair price for a product this good, and it allows me to get closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is only willing to go as low as $110, which is still above my minimum of $120. It's a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. I've already spent a few rounds trying to get a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  Plus, it's a good deal for both of us."
