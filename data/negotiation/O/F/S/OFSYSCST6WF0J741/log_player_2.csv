"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to him ($8,000), it's still above his desired price. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for us to close a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point and his alternative with John. He has 7 rounds remaining, giving him room to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal if you consider it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still has several rounds left and can potentially negotiate further.  It's still above his ideal price and his fallback option with John, so rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $10,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $9,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,250. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob has only two rounds left.  He's already rejected a price of $10,000, and Alice's current offer of $10,250 is still significantly higher than his fallback option with John for $8,000.  Given the limited time and the potential for Alice to hold firm on her price, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept John's offer and secure the product for $8,000."
