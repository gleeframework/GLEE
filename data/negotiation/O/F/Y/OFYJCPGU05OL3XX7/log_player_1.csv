"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the product's unique nature and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 
  
**Reasoning:** Starting with a very high initial offer serves two purposes:

* **Anchoring:**  It sets a high reference point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial high price, it can influence his perception of what a ""reasonable"" price might be during subsequent offers.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this offer will be telling. If he counters aggressively, it indicates strong interest and a willingness to pay a premium. If he rejects it outright, I can adjust my strategy accordingly in later rounds.
 
It's important to remember I have the fallback option of John at $1,000,000, ensuring I won't be forced to settle for less than the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high to test the waters and gauge his willingness to pay a premium. His counteroffer, while lower, indicates he's serious and still willing to pay considerably more than my minimum. I'll use the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the significant value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects the true value and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By countering at $1,700,000, I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than both my minimum and his initial offer.
* **Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""meeting in the middle"" concept to make the offer seem more appealing and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,400,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is strong. While I might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, it's not guaranteed. Accepting this offer gives me a $600,000 profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling or Bob lowering his offer further.  It's a good deal at this point."
