"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $975,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",960000.0,Bob,6,
