Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and at $9,500, you've secured a decent discount. Holding out for a slightly better price might backfire, leaving you with John's $10,000 offer."
