Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $850000. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while I can acquire the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
