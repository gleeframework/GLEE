While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit margin for you. It also shows that you're willing to negotiate but not to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
