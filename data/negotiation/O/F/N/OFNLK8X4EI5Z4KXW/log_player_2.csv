Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's important to stand firm and aim for a price that works for you. This offer lands right at Alice's perceived value of the product, so it'll be interesting to see her response."
