"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
