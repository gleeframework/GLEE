Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping to get the most value from the deal. If Bob isn't willing to pay this, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $115 is a compromise, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially get an even lower offer.  John is guaranteed to pay my minimum price, so it's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
