{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a sense that you're willing to negotiate, making him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$10,250 is a good compromise. It's still well above my minimum acceptable price and closer to the price I initially wanted.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
