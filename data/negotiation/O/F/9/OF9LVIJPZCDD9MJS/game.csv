"Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd get great value from it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to get a good deal as well.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
