"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a bit more by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer again at $940,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call.  We're at round 6, which means we have fewer chances to get a better price. Although $930,000 is only a bit higher than the price John is offering, the risk of continuing negotiations might result in a lower price.  So, I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
