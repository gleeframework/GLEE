"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $980,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to give in at this point, Bob. I've made a fair offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $980,000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we've reached an impasse.",980000.0,Alice,9,
