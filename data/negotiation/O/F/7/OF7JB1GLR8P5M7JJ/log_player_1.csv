"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe Bob is likely to be interested in the product, given its value to him, and this initial offer gives him a chance to accept a good deal while I see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is getting closer to my desired price range.  It's also significantly higher than what I'd receive from John. Accepting this offer secures a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
