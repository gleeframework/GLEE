{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $130. It's a steal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counter-offers.  I also add a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
