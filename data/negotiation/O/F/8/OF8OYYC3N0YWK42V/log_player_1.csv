Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is bluffing. He's trying to pressure me by mentioning another seller (John) offering the product for $8,000, which is exactly the value it has for him. It's clear he's not willing to meet my price point, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob."
