"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above your target price of $15,000.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $9,000, which is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation. It's a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, which should encourage her to consider it seriously. This also puts pressure on Alice to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my target price, it's still a bit high. I'm going to try one more round of counteroffers to see if I can get Alice down to a price closer to my target. If she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price. However, it's still within my budget and leaves room for a final negotiation. If Alice rejects this, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has remained stubborn, and her offer of $13,500 is too high for me.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $15,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my budget, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating with Alice."
