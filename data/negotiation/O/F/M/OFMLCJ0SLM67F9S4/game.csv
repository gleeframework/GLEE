"I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll throw in an additional incentive - I'll include a premium service package worth $500. So, I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations.",10500.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate the additional incentive, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned about the price. Can you reconsider and meet me at $10000, without the premium service package?",10000.0,Bob,6,,
