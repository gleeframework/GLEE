"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal at $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
