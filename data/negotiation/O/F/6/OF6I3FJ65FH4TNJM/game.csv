"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
