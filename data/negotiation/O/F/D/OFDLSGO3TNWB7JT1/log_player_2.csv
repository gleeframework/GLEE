"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate further.  I'm hoping to get the price down closer to $1,000,000, and I have enough rounds left to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is getting closer to my target price of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a significantly better offer and risk losing the deal altogether. This price is a good compromise and I'm comfortable accepting it."
