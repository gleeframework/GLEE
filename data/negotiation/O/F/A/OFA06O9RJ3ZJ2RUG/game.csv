"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still looking to stay closer to my initial offer, though.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay closer to your initial offer, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $11,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to push the price down, but I'm not comfortable going below $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $11,250, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this price.",11250.0,Alice,7,
