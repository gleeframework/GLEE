Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,250, which is closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is clearly trying to meet me in the middle.  $11,250 is a good price and it's not worth risking losing the deal for a slightly lower amount."
