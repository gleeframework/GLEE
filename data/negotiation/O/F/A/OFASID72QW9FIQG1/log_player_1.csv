Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,600,000 is a good deal, and it's likely that Bob won't go higher. It's better to secure a sale than to risk losing him and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
