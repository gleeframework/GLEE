"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,000. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to recoup some of my costs. Let's meet in the middle!",8000.0,Alice,3,
