"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a starting price of $10,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price closer to his maximum of $12,000.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  This approach shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider $9,500 as a compromise. Let me know if this works for you or if you wish to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 and is within Bob's budget of $12,000.  It's a good compromise, and accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without further negotiation and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer.  It's also better than buying from John for $12,000."
