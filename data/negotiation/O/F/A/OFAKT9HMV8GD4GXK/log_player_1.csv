"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can see if Bob is serious about buying and how much he's willing to pay."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can bridge the gap further in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a price closer to my minimum."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round.  With only 6 rounds left, I need to start considering the risk of running out of time and having to settle for John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a slightly lower counteroffer than the previous round, acknowledging Bob's continued unwillingness to go higher. However, it's still above my minimum and leaves some room for potential negotiation in the remaining rounds.  It's important to start closing the gap, but not at the expense of losing too much value."

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation, we're now in the middle of the negotiation process with only 4 rounds left. I need to hold out for a better price. I'm going to counter again in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and with only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal is high. However, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far from my goal. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round, hoping to convince Bob to increase his offer.  If he refuses, I will be forced to consider selling to John in the final round."

With only one round remaining, I need to make a final push to secure a deal with Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer

```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's final offer is still below my minimum, and I've reached the end of the negotiation.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, selling to John ensures I meet my minimum financial goal and avoids the risk of not selling at all."
