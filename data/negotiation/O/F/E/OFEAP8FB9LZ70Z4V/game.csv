"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's fair considering our mutual interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming to be at $1,000,000.  Could you consider offering it to me for $1,025,000?  This would be a very fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,062,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
