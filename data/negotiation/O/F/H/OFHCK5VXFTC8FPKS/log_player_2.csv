# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this amazing product for $90 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 

**Explanation:**

While you could buy from John for $100, Alice's offer of $90 is still within your budget and saves you $10.  It's always better to get a lower price, even if it's just a small difference."
