"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise we both feel good about.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,200,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. It's a good compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
