"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
