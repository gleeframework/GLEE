"Thanks Alice, that's a great starting point. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see it at a price closer to $500000 to make it work for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $550000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $525000?  It's a good price for both of us and gets this deal done.",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $525000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $575000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",575000.0,Alice,5,
