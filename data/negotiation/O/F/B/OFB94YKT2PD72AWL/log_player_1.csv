Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you keep the conversation open.  Even if he rejects the initial offer, it provides room to negotiate down towards $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and potential counter-offers."
