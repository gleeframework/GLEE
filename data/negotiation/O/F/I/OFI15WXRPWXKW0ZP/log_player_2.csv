"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's too early to buy from John, as there's a chance to get the product for less from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering your valuation of the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still too high. There's room for further negotiation. Buying from John at this point is not a good option, as Bob can likely get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to your offer, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $925,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. Let's meet in the middle at $912,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some willingness to compromise, the price is still higher than Bob's target. There's a chance to negotiate further and secure a better deal. Buying from John would be a last resort if Bob can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still too high for me. I'm proposing we meet at $893,750. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 893750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $915,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $904,375. This is a fair compromise that I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $904,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $904,375

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still too high. Bob can likely squeeze a slightly lower price from Alice by continuing to negotiate. Buying from John at this point would be premature and more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $904,375 is still a bit high for me. I'm proposing we meet at $899,062.50. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs.  I'm confident we can close this deal right now."", ""product_price"": 899062.50}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're willing to meet me halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $907,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's target price, but there's still a small margin for negotiation.  While this is Alice's ""final"" offer, Bob has one round left to see if he can squeeze out a lower price.  Buying from John at this point is too expensive compared to the potential of getting a slightly lower price from Alice."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $907,500 is still outside my budget.

I'm ready to close this deal right now if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 901250}
