"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested,  $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $1100000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll see the value in it and I'm open to further discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
