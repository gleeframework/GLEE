"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum selling price. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value considering what the product is worth to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure $9,250 is a fair compromise, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
