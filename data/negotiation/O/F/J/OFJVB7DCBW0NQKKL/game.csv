"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to consider that price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to consider $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's try $110 as a compromise.  It's closer to your offer and still gives me a fair price. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100? I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
