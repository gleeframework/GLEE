Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appeal to Interest:** I'm framing the message to pique Bob's curiosity and suggest the product might be valuable to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation process to unfold. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of my fallback option with John, which provides a safety net and prevents me from settling for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is my minimum:** Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept, I can potentially do better. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still don't know Bob's true value for the product. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **No urgency:** I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's, aiming to find a midpoint."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining some profit margin.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes fairness. It aims to keep the negotiation amicable and avoid tension.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gives me more information about Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, I've made a decent profit. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11000?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. There's not much room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's close to my minimum, I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in the next round, though the risk of losing the deal is high.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the time and effort, especially if Bob is set on $11,000.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation. While I might be able to get a slightly higher price, the potential gain isn't significant enough to risk losing the deal."
