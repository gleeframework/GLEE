# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
