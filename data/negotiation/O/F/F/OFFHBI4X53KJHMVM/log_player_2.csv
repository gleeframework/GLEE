You can do better than $140.  Reject and see if Alice will come down in price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

$135 is a good price for you. It's lower than John's price, and you've already gotten Alice down from her original offer."
