Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,500.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justifying the Price:** Mentioning ""features and benefits"" subtly implies the product's value, even though the initial price is above Bob's perceived worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating you're ""open to discussing,"" you signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You know you have a guaranteed $12,000 from John. There's room to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the product's inherent value and potential, I could consider coming down to $13,000.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By coming down to $13,000, you are demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:**  You're still anchoring the price above both Bob's offer and your minimum, leaving room for further negotiation but moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Justification:** Re-iterating the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's benefits, aiming to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,000. Would that be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
