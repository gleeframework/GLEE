Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000 to John.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $10,000 aims to maximize your profit while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($2,000). This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

By starting with a strong offer that benefits both parties, you increase your chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price that exceeds your minimum acceptable price."
