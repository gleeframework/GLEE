"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm starting with an offer of $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth less than $200. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you think the product is worth less than $200, but I believe it's worth more than $150.  How about we meet in the middle at $175?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I still feel that the product should be priced lower than $175. Could you consider $160 as a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more.  I'm not yet convinced that I need to sell to Bob, and I can still try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $160 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $165. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $160 is a reasonable price for the product. Could you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob is being stubborn about his offer of $160.  While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure he'll budge further.  I've already rejected his offer twice, and I'm not sure I can get a better price.  Selling to John for $150 is also an option, but I'd prefer to get a bit more.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this round."
