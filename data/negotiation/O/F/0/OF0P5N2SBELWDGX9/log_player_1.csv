Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for your consideration.  Based on its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $750,000 is more than my minimum, it's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $850,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher price, $825,000 is close to my minimum and still a profitable deal.  It's worth securing the sale and avoiding further negotiations."
