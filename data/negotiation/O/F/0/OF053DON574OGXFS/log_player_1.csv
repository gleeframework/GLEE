Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Agreement"":**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start high.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps you well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair deal"" project confidence in your position.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. If he outright rejects $1,400,000, you can gauge his seriousness and potentially lower the price slightly. However, don't go below $1,500,000, as John offers you a guaranteed sale at that price."
