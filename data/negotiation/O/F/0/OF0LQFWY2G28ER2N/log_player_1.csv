"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but significantly below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without immediately making him feel it's not worth pursuing.
* **Friendly Approach:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for both Bob to counter and me to make adjustments, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly.
* I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds remaining and my potential backup offer with John to make strategic decisions throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. He recognizes the value of the product and is willing to pay more than his initial perception.
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:**  Selling to John is a safe option that guarantees my minimum price, but I believe I can potentially get a higher price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will keep in mind John's offer as a safety net, but I believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that satisfies us both."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that is significantly closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, appealing to Bob's desire for a fair deal. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** The counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, allowing for potential adjustments in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a satisfactory price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy.
* I'll continue to monitor the number of rounds remaining and the backup offer from John to ensure I make the best possible decision."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still not quite there. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I've already shown flexibility and am confident that I can get a slightly higher price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to $11,500. I'll continue to be firm but fair, reminding Bob of the value of the product and the benefits of reaching an agreement.

```

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

* **Few Rounds Left:** We are in the eighth round, leaving only two rounds remaining before I have to accept John's offer.
