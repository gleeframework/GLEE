"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you while still allowing me a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, but I was thinking it could be a bit lower. I'd like to propose $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I think we can do better. I'd like to propose $920,000.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but I'd like to propose a condition: if you accept this price, I'd like you to throw in a 6-month warranty and a dedicated support package. This would be a great value-add for me, and I'm willing to meet you at $950,000 if you're willing to include these extras. If not, I'm willing to go as low as $920,000 without the extras.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you offering the additional services, but they're outside the scope of our initial agreement. I'm willing to stick to the product itself and offer you a price of $970,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",970000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,8,
