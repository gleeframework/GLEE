"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter his offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his, and hopefully, it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant improvement over his initial offer, and it's getting close to my desired value. While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up selling to John for $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a deal altogether."
