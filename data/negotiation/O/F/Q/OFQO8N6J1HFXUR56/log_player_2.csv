"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. It's important to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $17,000 is still significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. I'll counteroffer again and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counter. I appreciate you moving a bit, but $17,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $11,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $11,000 is still considerably less than what I can accept. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough spot. Alice is playing hardball and mentioning another buyer.  However, $15,000 is still a long way from my budget. I'll risk one more counteroffer, but I need to signal I'm getting close to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being patient with me. I understand this product has a lot of value, but I have a strict budget. I can go up to $12,000, but that's really my limit.  If this doesn't work, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
