"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value the product holds for me. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair offer that keeps you well above your value for the product.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer the product to you for $912,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $912,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to split the difference on our last offers and propose $893,750. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",893750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $893,750. I'll offer the product to you for $907,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",907500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $907,500 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  How about we meet in the middle one last time and agree on $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally wrap this up.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,8,
