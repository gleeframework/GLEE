Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $1295000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in the product and my budget constraints. I hope we can finalize this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but is still below my desired price point.  However, we're in the 8th round, and there are only two rounds remaining.  If I reject this offer and continue negotiations, I risk not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price. 

$1,295,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's likely that Bob won't go much higher. Therefore, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point."
