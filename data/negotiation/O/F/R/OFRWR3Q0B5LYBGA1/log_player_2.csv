"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, it's always good to see if you can get a better price.  There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. This leaves $3,000 of potential savings for Bob, which is substantial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to your target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice lowered her price to $14,000, it's time to increase your counteroffer.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise that shows you're serious about a deal, but still leaves some room for Alice to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is only $500 away from your previous counteroffer and a $1,500 savings from your initial maximum.  It's likely you won't get much lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
