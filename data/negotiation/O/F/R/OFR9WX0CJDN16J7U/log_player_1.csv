Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, it's clear he's unlikely to meet the minimum threshold I need. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
