"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,100,000 is too low, I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
