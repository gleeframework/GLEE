{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a profit close to my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is not unreasonable and leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation open and prevents him from immediately rejecting the deal. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, which might influence his decision to accept.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. If the negotiation stalls or looks unfavorable, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe I can still secure a better price by making a counteroffer. There's a possibility that Bob is willing to go a bit higher to get the product.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further. 

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll carefully consider the details of his offer, my perceived value of the product to him, and the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing compromise and profit:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value and agreement:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob and emphasizing the win-win aspect of the offer.
* **Leaving room for a final negotiation:**  A $50,000 difference remains, which allows for a final round of negotiation if necessary.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John. However, if there's a chance for a final agreement with Bob, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and am now proposing a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is low:** While I could counteroffer, it's unlikely Bob would go much higher, considering he's already made concessions. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing the negotiation could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate.

**Next steps:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob.  The $1,125,000 price is a good compromise and achieves my goal of earning as much as possible from the sale."
