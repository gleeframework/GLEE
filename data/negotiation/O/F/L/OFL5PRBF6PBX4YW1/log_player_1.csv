Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, but still allows for potential profit if Bob accepts. 
*  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a lower price to see if Bob is willing to accept.  
* If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer. 
* If the negotiations stall, I can always move on to John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than I'm able to go right now. I'm willing to drop the price to $110. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $110:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price of $150. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, but reiterate my own position. The message is friendly but firm, indicating I'm open to negotiation but not willing to accept his initial offer. 

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I am continuing the negotiation and potentially finding a price that works for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I can decide whether to go lower again or to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is still too far below my minimum price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit."
