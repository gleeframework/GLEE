"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice's minimum selling price is $80, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer opens the door to a counteroffer and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $92?  It's a good compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $92 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to John's offer of $100.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but at this point, the potential savings are small, and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
