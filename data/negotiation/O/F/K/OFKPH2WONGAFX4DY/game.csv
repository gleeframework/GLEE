"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $19,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
