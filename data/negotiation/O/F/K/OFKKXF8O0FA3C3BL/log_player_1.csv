**Reasoning:**

While ideally, we'd want to get closer to our initial offer, Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,500,000.  Here's why accepting is the best move now:

* **Profitable:**  $1,500,000 is a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks reaching an impasse and wasting valuable time. Selling to John is a last resort, and every round spent on Bob delays potential deals with other buyers.
* **Bob's Determination:** Bob's repeated offers at $1,500,000 suggest this is likely his ceiling. Trying to push further might make him walk away entirely."
