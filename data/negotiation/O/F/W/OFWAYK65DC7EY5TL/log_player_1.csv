"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong initial price that's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below the $1,000,000 you originally proposed. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to your desired price. It's also important to remember that you have 10 rounds in total, so you have time to explore further offers. While you could continue to try and squeeze out more, accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
