Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering the product at a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still potentially appealing. It also leaves room for negotiation and builds a positive tone by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable price for me.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm not likely to get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would yield the same profit."
