Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,200,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, $1,400,000 is a good step in the right direction. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000. This price is fair, considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is very close to my desired price point, I'm still holding out for something closer to $1,450,000.  We're in the final stages of negotiation, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price by continuing to engage with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $1,425,000 is a good offer.  To finalize this deal, how about we split the difference and go with $1,437,500? This would ensure a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1437500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully. Based on our negotiation thus far, I believe $1,420,000 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer being $1,420,000, we're still not at my desired price point of $1,450,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, ensuring I meet my minimum acceptable value."
