# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $12,000 it would bring you. However, to make this opportunity more attractive, I am willing to extend a special offer. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $11,000? This is a fantastic deal considering the immense value it holds for you. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
