"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is slightly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's acceptable.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
