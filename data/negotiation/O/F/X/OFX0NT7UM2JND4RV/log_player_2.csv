"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
