"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? I'm very interested and believe this would be a fair deal.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $180 is steep, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $160 to break even. How about we say $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $135? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $155? That's the lowest I can go without losing money.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have other options available to me. If you're unable to go lower than $150, I'll have to consider those alternatives.",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get something more substantial. How about we meet at $165? That's the best I can do.",165.0,Alice,7,
