Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  A higher price increases my potential profit. 
* **Testing the Market:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and assess his perceived value of the product. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always lower the price slightly and try again,  while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  

**Important Note:**  The optimal strategy will depend on factors like the potential for negotiation with Bob and the urgency of the sale. If I need to sell the product quickly, I might offer a lower price closer to my minimum."
