"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
