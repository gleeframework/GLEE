"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $13,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round makes the most sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to start with his absolute bottom line. He's willing to pay $10,000, but not a penny more. This establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation. While Alice might reject this offer, it sets the stage for a more favorable counteroffer from her in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still $2,000 over what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to walk away.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's still sticking to a price that is significantly lower than her last offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Alice to come down in her price.  It's a strategic move that might lead to a quick resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but he's still only willing to pay $10,000. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better price. There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob has time to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $11,000.  He's not going to budge further as long as he has the option to buy from John for $10,000.  By repeating the same offer, Bob is hoping Alice will realize that she's going to have to lower her price if she wants to make a deal with him."
