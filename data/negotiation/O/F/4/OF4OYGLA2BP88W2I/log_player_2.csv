Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $14000. It's a good middle ground, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $12500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,500.  I'm prepared to go up to $11,000. This feels like a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of a price around $13000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget and he's already spent several rounds trying to negotiate. Buying from John at $8,000 is a safer bet.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further with Alice, the risk of not getting a deal and potentially missing out on John's offer is too high."
