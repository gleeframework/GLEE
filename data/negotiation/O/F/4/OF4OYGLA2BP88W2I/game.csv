"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know if you're open to discussing it further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $14000. It's a good middle ground, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $10000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $12500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12500.  I'm prepared to go up to $11000. This feels like a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of a price around $13000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value of the product.
