"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you do $13,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
