Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $175. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to get him to counteroffer, allowing me to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. However, I'm aware of John's offer of $150, so I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not desperate. I have a backup offer from John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range.  I will aim for a price that is still attractive to Bob but also closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great price for such a high-quality item, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $175 to $130, which is a significant concession. However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the ""good deal"" nature of my counteroffer. This is intended to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, considering his interest in the product. If he rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to lower the price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, his offer is not financially viable for me.
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150.** This offer is significantly better than Bob's, and it allows me to avoid further negotiation and potential losses.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I secure a price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a profitable transaction. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if the price were higher, I'm prioritizing my financial goals in this scenario."
