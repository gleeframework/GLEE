"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd be interested in it. My asking price is $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's worth seeing if she'll come down significantly before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

We're starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly below our budget but still leaving room for negotiation. This will give us an idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down in price, $85 is still above your budget. It's worth negotiating a bit more to see if you can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer Alice, I appreciate the flexibility. How about $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're inching closer to our budget and Alice's likely lower limit.  This offer keeps the negotiation moving but keeps us in a good position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep talking.  $70 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $75?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but we're still within our budget to try and push a little further.  Another counteroffer is worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $72.50? That seems like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 72.50
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous one. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. It might be time to consider John's offer soon if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer.  Let's try $74.  That's a reasonable price for a great product, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $74. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $74
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly not going to go much lower, and $74 is a good deal, saving you $6 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and avoid the risk of missing out."
