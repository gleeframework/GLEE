"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it! I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you'd like to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,100,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but still a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,075,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $1,060,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal today at that number.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,060,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we try $1,080,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to move up slightly to $1,065,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision today.",1065000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last concession, so how about we try $1,090,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
