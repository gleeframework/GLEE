Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $750,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $800,000? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. Can you consider that?

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same price that John is willing to pay.  While I would prefer to get more, this is a good deal that ensures I reach my minimum goal. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
