Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John offers a safe $1,000,000, Bob values the product much higher. Aiming closer to Bob's valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay beyond the given $1,500,000."
