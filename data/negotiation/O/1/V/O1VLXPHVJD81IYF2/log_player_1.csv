"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable.  I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to discuss it further. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $11,500. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be workable?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10,200? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment at that price."", ""product_price"": 10200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit. Would you be willing to settle at $9,800? That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $10,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
