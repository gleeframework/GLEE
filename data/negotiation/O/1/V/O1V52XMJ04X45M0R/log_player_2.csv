# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90. While that's a good deal, you can get it from John for $100.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you can save $10."
