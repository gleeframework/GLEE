{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to your business.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price is still well below the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1,325,000. This price offers a fair margin for you while keeping me within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  It seems like Bob is willing to negotiate, so I'll try one more counteroffer."
