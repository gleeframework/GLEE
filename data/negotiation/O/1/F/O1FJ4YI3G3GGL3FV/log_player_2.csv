"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to your business.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her offer is closer to your upper limit than to her lower limit. 
* There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price is still well below the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still closer to your upper limit than her lower limit.
* You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* Buying from John right now would cost you more than Alice's current offer, and you haven't explored all your options with her yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1,325,000. This price offers a fair margin for you while keeping me within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $1,337,500. This price would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly. Her current offer is getting close to your lower limit, and you've already rejected a lower offer. 
* Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's risky. There's no guarantee Alice will lower the price further, and you're approaching your deadline. 
* Buying from John would cost you significantly more, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal from him in the future.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most reasonable choice, balancing risk with potential savings."
