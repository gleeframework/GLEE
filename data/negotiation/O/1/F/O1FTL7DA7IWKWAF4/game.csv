"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $790,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",790000.0,Alice,5,
