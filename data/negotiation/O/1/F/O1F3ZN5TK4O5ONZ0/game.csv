"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
