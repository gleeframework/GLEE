"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9500. If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10200.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to add a small premium to account for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10600. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",10600.0,Alice,7,
