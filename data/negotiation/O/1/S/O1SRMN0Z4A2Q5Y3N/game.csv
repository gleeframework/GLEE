"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too much for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, at $14,500.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
