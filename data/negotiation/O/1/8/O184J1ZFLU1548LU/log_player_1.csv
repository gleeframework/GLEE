Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I can likely do better with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I still believe $100 would be a fair price for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $105, but I'm still not quite there. How about $108? It's a fair compromise and closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product, I'd like to propose $107 as a fair price. Let's aim for a win-win solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $107 isn't my ideal price, it's getting close to what I want and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away. It's also a better deal than selling to John."
