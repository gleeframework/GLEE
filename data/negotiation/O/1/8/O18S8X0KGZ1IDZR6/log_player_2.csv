You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above his maximum budget. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also pushing for a significant price reduction. The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can continue to push for a lower price.  There are still many rounds left, and Bob can still get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. He is pushing the negotiation towards a price point that is closer to his limit, and with more rounds remaining, he can continue to refine his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it is still $180,000 higher than his maximum budget. With more rounds left, Bob can still try to push for a better deal.  He can continue to refine his counteroffers, aiming to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise and demonstrating progress in the negotiation. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's previous offer, signaling that he is seriously considering buying the product from her. However, he is still staying within his budget and pushing for a favorable price. By maintaining this approach, Bob can hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $190,000 higher than his maximum.  There are still three rounds left, and Bob can continue to try and push for a better price. He can continue to make counteroffers and see if he can convince Alice to lower her price further.  There's always the option to buy from John, but it's worth trying to see if Bob can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 970000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, but with only two rounds left, Bob is increasing his offer to a point where Alice might be tempted to accept. It's a slight increase from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal.  However, he is still within his budget and leaving room for a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a difficult decision, but with only one round left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget than before, it is still $195,000 higher than his maximum. 

It's unlikely that Alice will come down to Bob's desired price in the last round.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, guaranteeing a successful purchase."
