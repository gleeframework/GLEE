Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. While I appreciate your offer,  $7,900 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,050. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
