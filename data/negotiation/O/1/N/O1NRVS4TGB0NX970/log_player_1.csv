Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. Offering it at $130 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you (Alice). 
* **Considering the alternative:** While you have John as a backup buyer, it's always better to secure the higher price with Bob if possible.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
