"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $750000. That's getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $725000.  I think that's a fair compromise considering the price range we've been discussing. What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725000. I'm counteroffering at $735000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",735000.0,Alice,5,
