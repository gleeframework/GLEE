"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and encouraging message to start the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Does he seem open to negotiation, or does he immediately counter with a much lower price?
* **Set a high starting point:**  This gives me leverage in future negotiations.
* **Avoid being too aggressive:** I don't want to scare Bob off right away. 

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $5,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Negotiating further with Bob is risky:**  While I could try to counteroffer, Bob's initial low offer suggests he may not be willing to negotiate much higher. 

**Strategy:**

Given the significant difference between Bob's offer and my desired price, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of ending up with a much lower sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price is still fair, considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've moved slightly from my initial offer but still maintain a price that is above Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while still prioritizing my financial goals.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Openness to Compromise:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation, but not at the expense of my own needs.
* **Gauge Bob's response:**  Will he accept this offer, counter with a higher price, or again offer a significantly lower amount?
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his initial offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and set a higher baseline.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he continues to offer significantly lower prices, I may consider selling to John to avoid wasting time in futile negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $7,000 is closer to my desired price, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Selling to John remains the best option:**  Given my minimum price and the fact that John is a guaranteed buyer, there's no strong reason to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Strategy:**

My priority is to maximize my earnings.  Even though Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are still too low.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of a lower sale price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within a reasonable budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm again moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but maintaining a price that is still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I emphasize that my counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer, highlighting my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value & Budget:**  I remind Bob of the value the product brings to him and try to appeal to his budget constraints.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  While showing flexibility, I'm not accepting a price below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's response:** Will he accept this offer, or will he continue to offer a lower price? 
* **Increase the pressure:**  With each round, I am slowly decreasing my counteroffer, making Bob aware that we are getting closer to a potential deal or a breakdown in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response and make a decision based on the remaining rounds and my financial goals. If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I will likely choose to sell to John and avoid further risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget.  $8,000 is my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $8,000 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  I only have four rounds left, and Bob's ""final offer"" suggests he might not budge further.  There's a risk that I could spend the remaining rounds negotiating with Bob only to end up with a price lower than what John is offering.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $15,000, which meets my minimum requirements and eliminates further risk. 

**Strategy:**

Time is a factor now. With only four rounds remaining and Bob's ""final offer"" still below my minimum, I can't afford to risk losing a guaranteed sale with John.  The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price."
