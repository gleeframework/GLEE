"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price is still fair, considering the value this product brings to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within a reasonable budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget.  $8,000 is my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
