"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
