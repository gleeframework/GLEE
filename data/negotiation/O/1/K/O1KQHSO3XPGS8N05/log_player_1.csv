Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer.
* **Creating significant value for Bob:** He saves $10 compared to his perceived value.
* **Maximizing your profit:** You are making a $40 profit, which is much better than John's offer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John."
