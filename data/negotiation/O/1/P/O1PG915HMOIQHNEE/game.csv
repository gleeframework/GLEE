"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,4,
