Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably commit to. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000, which is a significant investment for me, but still leaves some room for us to both come out ahead.
