Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me halfway?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not going to rush into a decision when I have more negotiating rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm concerned we won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds.  John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is closer to my desired price."
