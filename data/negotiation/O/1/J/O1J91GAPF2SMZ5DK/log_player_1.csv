Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum price of $120. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell the product at my minimum price of $120, I'm not convinced that's the best deal I can get. I'd rather see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price of $135, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This compromise shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe my product is worth more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly higher than John's offer, it's still above my minimum price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
