"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $10,500? This would still represent a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we try $10,000?  That's a smaller jump from my last offer and is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're set on $9,500, but that's still too low for me.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to make one more compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's only $500 more than your last offer, and it would still be a great deal for you. Let's close this deal. ",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go to $10,000. I'm still willing to meet you at $9,500, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you please consider it?",9500.0,Bob,8,
