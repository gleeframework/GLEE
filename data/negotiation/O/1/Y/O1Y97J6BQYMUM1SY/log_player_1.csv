"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit while still securing a deal with Bob. If the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can always switch to John for my guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is interested, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I still have rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum price gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and aim for a price closer to my minimum. If negotiations continue to stall or fall below my threshold, I'll switch to John to secure my guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $10,500? This would still represent a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Counter:** I'm proposing a price that's a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the good deal Bob would still be getting at $10,500.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to meet halfway while still protecting my financial interests. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to consider a higher price, but I'm prepared to switch to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is willing to compromise, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** I have several more rounds remaining, which means there's still room for negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** The fact that John is willing to pay my minimum price gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to counter Bob's offers, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if I feel that negotiations with Bob are not progressing favorably."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we try $10,000?  That's a smaller jump from my last offer and is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incremental Change:**  I'm again proposing a compromise, but this time I'm making a smaller adjustment from my last offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still showing that I'm not willing to drop my price significantly. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly reinforcing that the price is still fair.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  This price is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual approach to find a middle ground.  This round's counteroffer is a smaller step, showing willingness to negotiate while also holding firm on my expectations. If Bob continues to refuse, I'll continue to counter, but I'm prepared to switch to John if necessary to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with Bob's insistence, his offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I still have time to reach a better agreement.
* **Selling to John is a strong fallback:** Knowing John is ready to pay my minimum price gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm confident I can still secure a more profitable deal with Bob or switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $9,500, but that's still too low for me.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to make one more compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's only $500 more than your last offer, and it would still be a great deal for you. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while maintaining my financial goals.
* **Urgency and Closing:** I'm adding a sense of urgency, suggesting it's time to close the deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. If Bob continues to refuse, I'm ready to switch to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go to $10,000. I'm still willing to meet you at $9,500, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you please consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firmly stuck at $9,500, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have two rounds left, and there's little chance of a breakthrough.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited remaining rounds and the lack of progress with Bob, it's more advantageous to switch to John to secure my guaranteed $15,000 profit. While I'm disappointed to not close the deal with Bob, it's a strategic decision to protect my financial interests."
