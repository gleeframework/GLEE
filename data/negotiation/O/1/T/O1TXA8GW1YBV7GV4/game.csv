"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $940,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  ",940000.0,Alice,5,
