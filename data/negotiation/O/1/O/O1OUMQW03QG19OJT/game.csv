"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However,  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can reach a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us, given the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,6,
