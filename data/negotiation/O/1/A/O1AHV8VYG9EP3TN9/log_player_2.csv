Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll sell the product to you for $9,750.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject the offer. While $9,750 is closer to your target price, you still have more rounds to negotiate.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **You're close to your target:**  Alice's offer of $9,500 is only $750 away from your desired price.
* **Only one round left:** You have one round remaining to negotiate.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to get a better price from Alice.
* **Secure your savings:**  Buying from John guarantees you the best price at $8,000. It's better to lock in the savings than risk missing out on a good deal.

Even though you could potentially get a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk of not getting a better deal and having to pay more outweighs the potential for a small saving.  It's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
