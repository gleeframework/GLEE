Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" for him, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm ready to counteroffer if Bob rejects, so I'm not giving away the farm with this initial offer. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  This price is significantly higher than John's offer, so I'm still in a good position even if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to make. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore that possibility. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, but knowing I have John's offer ensures I won't be stuck with a deal that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That way, we both walk away happy and the deal gets done."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize that both of us will be ""happy"" with the deal, making it sound like a win-win situation.
* **Urgency:**  I subtly imply that we should close the deal by mentioning ""getting it done,"" encouraging Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $9,800 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Bob has already rejected my counteroffer, and if I reject his offer again, he might walk away.
* **John's offer is a backup:** I'm not desperate, as John is willing to pay significantly more. 

This is a calculated risk.  I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
