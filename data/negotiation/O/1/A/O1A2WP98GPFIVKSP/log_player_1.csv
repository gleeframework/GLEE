Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good practice to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $22,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. While this is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, it might influence his counteroffer to be higher than if I had started lower.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the safety net of John's offer ($15,000), so I can afford to be more ambitious in my initial offer to Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I can offer $12,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss. 

I believe there's room to meet somewhere in the middle. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I can demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a price that's beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's offer while still aiming for a higher price point. It's a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $18,000 keeps me above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters. It also allows for a potential compromise that's still significantly more profitable than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I can offer $14,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is now within a reasonable range. While it's not ideal, it's higher than my guaranteed option with John ($15,000). 

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profitable:** $14,000 is a significant profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away entirely.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to allocate my time to other opportunities. 
 
It's a good deal, and it makes sense to accept."
