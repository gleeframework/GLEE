"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a very unique product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $1,000,000.  I'm open to negotiating a fair price.  Would you be interested in discussing a potential sale? I'm offering it for $1,500,000 as a starting point."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to me to subtly signal its potential worth to Bob.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I emphasize my willingness to negotiate to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the process. 
* **First Round Strategy:** I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm still early in the negotiation, and Bob has shown interest.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and potentially increase the sale price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm confident the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $1,350,000?  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for rejecting Bob's offer, emphasizing the product's value. This is important for maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Compromise:**  I explicitly suggest a compromise to encourage Bob to see the value in moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1325000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's important to consider that I have already gone through 4 rounds of negotiation and we're approaching the halfway point. 

Accepting this offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of losing the sale. There's always the chance that I could get a slightly higher price, but it's not worth risking a deal for a small increase."
