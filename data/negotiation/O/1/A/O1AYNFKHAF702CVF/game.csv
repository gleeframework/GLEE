"Hello Bob, I have a very unique product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $1000000.  I'm open to negotiating a fair price.  Would you be interested in discussing a potential sale? I'm offering it for $1500000 as a starting point.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm confident the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $1350000?  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $1325000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
