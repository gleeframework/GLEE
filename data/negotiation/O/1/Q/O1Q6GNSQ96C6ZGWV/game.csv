"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $20000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to go to $13000,  that's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $14500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
