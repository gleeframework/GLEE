Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some incentive to buy, as he'll still be getting a good deal compared to what he'd be willing to pay.
* **Lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This ensures that I'll still make a profit even if he rejects the offer and I sell to John. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
