"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price would give me a good return on my investment, and it's still well below what I'd receive from another buyer. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good return on your investment, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This offer is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
