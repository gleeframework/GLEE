"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $1,100,000. It's a one-time opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,075,000 is still above Bob's target of $1,000,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate, as there is still room to potentially reach a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I can't go as high as $1,075,000, I'm willing to meet you a little closer. How about $1,060,000?  This would allow us both to save some money and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,065,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,065,000 is getting closer to his target, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and attempt to get a price closer to $1,000,000.  There are still a few rounds left, and he may be able to convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a little above my budget at $1,065,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,055,000, but that's my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1055000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, $1,055,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,062,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing flexibility, Bob is running out of time.  He has only three rounds left, and he's still above his target price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees Bob the best possible price and avoids further negotiation. This ensures that Bob stays within his budget and gets the product he wants."
