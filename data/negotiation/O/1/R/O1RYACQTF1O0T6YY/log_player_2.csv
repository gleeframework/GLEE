"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation and gauge her willingness to move down. 
* **Strategic Undercut:** My offer is slightly more than halfway between her asking price and my maximum budget. This signals serious interest while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, $900,000 is still significantly more than John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  Alice's willingness to compromise suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** The existence of John's offer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It's a significant jump from my previous offer but still below Alice's last price and within a reasonable range of my budget.
* **Urgency and Fairness:**  By suggesting ""meeting in the middle again,"" I am emphasizing a sense of fairness and encouraging Alice to move closer to a price point that works for both of us. 
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  While I don't explicitly mention John's offer, I am aware that time is a factor.  I'm trying to move the negotiation toward a close, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While $850,000 is slightly above John's offer, it's within a reasonable range of my budget and a significant saving from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better price, but there's also the risk that Alice could walk away or that further negotiation will be too slow. 
* **Time Value:**  Securing the product now has value. Further delays could mean missing out on potential benefits of having the product."
