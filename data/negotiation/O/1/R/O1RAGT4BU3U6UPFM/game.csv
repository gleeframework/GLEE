"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal at $13,250. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, now is the time to act.",13250.0,Alice,5,
