"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for your product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product worth $8,000 to you. "", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is fair considering the product's value to me. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get a little more,  $8,000 is my minimum, and it's a good deal for both of us."
