Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to negotiate a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $14000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I have room to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

**Reasoning:**

While $14,200 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within the first half of the negotiations and have a few rounds left. It's worth seeing if I can push for a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm willing to meet you halfway, $14,200 is still slightly below what I need to make this worthwhile.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I am willing to pay $14300 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,300 is very close to my last counteroffer of $14,350. It's more than my minimum threshold of $12,000, and we're nearing the end of the negotiations. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal while avoiding the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
