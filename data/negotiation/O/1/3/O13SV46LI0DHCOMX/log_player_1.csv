Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the higher price, like ""significant value"" or ""above market price,"" can make it more palatable.
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming high ($12,000), the offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be better.
* **Market Dynamics:**  If similar products are readily available for less, your negotiating position weakens."
