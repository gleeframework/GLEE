"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $10,000 is too far below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $12,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price reflects the value of the product and also gives you a great deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",11500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While $11,200 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $11,400. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we could finalize the sale.  What do you say?",11400.0,Alice,7,
