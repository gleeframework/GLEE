Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but still nets you a profit over John's offer. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By calling it an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you frame it as valuable.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value and potential"" hints at reasons for the price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not overthink. 
* **Strong Price:** $1,250,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but the urgency might make him consider it.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a less aggressive price might be wiser."
