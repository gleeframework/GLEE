"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You still have 9 rounds to make a deal, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still higher than $850,000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is closer to your desired price point of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, and you may end up paying more than $875,000. Additionally, you've already gone through two rounds of negotiation, and buying from John would cost you the same amount. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, and you can still explore other options in the future if you find a better deal."
