"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at $80, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit more. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
 
While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you have another option with John for $100. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or getting a better deal.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down to $85 or lower."
