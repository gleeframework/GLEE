Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1200000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This gives her leverage to aim significantly higher.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  The message hints at exclusivity and sets a short deadline to encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not revealing her bottom line, Alice vaguely links the price to the product's ""value and potential.""

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives high value. If Alice knows Bob is a very tough negotiator, she might start with a slightly lower price.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, and Alice will have to sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
