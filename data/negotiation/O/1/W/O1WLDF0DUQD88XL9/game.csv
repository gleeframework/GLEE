"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that.  How about $1,000,000? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives us room to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
