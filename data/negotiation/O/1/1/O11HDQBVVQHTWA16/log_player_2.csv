"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While $125 is more than the product is worth to you ($100), it's still cheaper than John's $150 offer. 
* **You want to save money.** By accepting Alice's offer, you'll save $25 compared to buying from John."
