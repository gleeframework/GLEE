{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $950,000 is still a bit too high, and you have room to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget. It's a fair starting point for negotiation."

$900,000 is still too high. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get the best possible price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still too high. I've been negotiating for a few rounds, and it's clear she's not willing to come down to a price that works for me.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
