Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $18,000 (50% above your minimum) sets an anchor in Bob's mind. While this price is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial offer, you gain a significant profit.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John if Bob rejects your offer. This safety net allows you to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and your assessment of Bob's willingness to pay, you might adjust your initial offer."
