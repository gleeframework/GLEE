"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose all the details, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential. If you're not interested, I have another buyer who is willing to pay $1000000, so this is a chance to secure a potentially valuable asset at a competitive price.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
