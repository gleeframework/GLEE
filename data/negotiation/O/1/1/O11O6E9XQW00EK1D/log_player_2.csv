Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm happy to pay $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

I've tried my best to negotiate with Alice, but it seems like we're stuck. At this point, it's better to buy from John for $80, which is within my budget and saves me money compared to Alice's offer."
