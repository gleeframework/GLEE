"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my top price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
