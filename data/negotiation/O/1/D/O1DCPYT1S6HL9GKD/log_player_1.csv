"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and still achieve a good price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the product's uniqueness and potential, aiming to increase Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is worded in a way that leaves room for negotiation and invites Bob to respond.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk strategy. Bob might immediately reject this offer. However, it sets the stage for a negotiation where I have the upper hand initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a subpar offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value of my product and would allow for a mutually beneficial partnership. I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm reducing my initial price, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price point. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Positive Language:** I use language that emphasizes collaboration and a potential partnership to maintain a positive tone.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options, potentially moving closer to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing a sale.
* **No Incentive to Counter:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting and the possibility of losing a deal outweighs the potential gain.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With 6 rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal now.  I'm confident that I can find other opportunities for a better profit in the future.

**Conclusion:** 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and strategic choice at this point. It allows me to secure a good deal within my minimum price range and ensures a sale without unnecessary risk."
