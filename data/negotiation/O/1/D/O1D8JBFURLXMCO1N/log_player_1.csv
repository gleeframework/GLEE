Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects its quality and ensures a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $14,000. This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still below John's offer.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and we risk leaving money on the table. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
