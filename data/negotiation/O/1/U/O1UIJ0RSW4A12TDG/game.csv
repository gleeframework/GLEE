,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $87 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider that price?",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $85, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $82.50. I can offer it to you for $83.75. It's the best I can do.",83.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I've decided to explore other options. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from someone else. I'll give you one last chance to meet my price of $82.50. If not, I'm out.",82.5,Bob,8,
