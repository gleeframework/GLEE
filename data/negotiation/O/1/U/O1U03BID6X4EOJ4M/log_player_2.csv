"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and counter-offering is the better strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. A $100,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point. It shows a willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. Accepting the $1,250,000 price secures a good deal and saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially going higher outweighs the potential gain."
