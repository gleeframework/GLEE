"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000 for the product?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, giving you a good deal and me a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but unfortunately, $750,000 is simply not a price I can accept.  It's much too low for the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $900,000.  This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
