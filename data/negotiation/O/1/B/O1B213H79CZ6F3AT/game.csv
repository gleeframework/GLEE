"Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a good middle ground, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, which is still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,5,
