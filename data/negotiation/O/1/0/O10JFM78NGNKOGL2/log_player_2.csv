"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still buying a product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it lower. 
* **Strategy:**  Bob should start by rejecting and seeing if he can get Alice to come down in price.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money, but still get a good deal. 
* **Counteroffer Logic:**  Bob is starting with a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his desire to bargain.  
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save money, but still get a good deal.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $8,000. 
* **Strategy:** Accepting the offer at this point balances the need to get a good price with the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or Alice refusing to budge. With only 7 rounds remaining, accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
