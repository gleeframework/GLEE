Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This gives you some leeway to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and leaves very little room for negotiation.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves a fair margin for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is at my minimum acceptable value. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting this offer is still a good deal for me, as I can't risk losing out on a sale to another buyer."
