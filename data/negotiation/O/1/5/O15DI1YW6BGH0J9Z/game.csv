"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
