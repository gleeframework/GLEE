"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer aims to secure a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point that reflects the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still a good deal, it's significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm confident I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a fair price, and it's the same price I could get from John. I'd rather close the deal now and avoid further negotiation."
