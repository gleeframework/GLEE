You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price, as he values it at $15,000.  By rejecting, he can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's valuation as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. He can potentially get it for even lower by continuing to counteroffer.  It's important to remember that John is still an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but still staying below Alice's last offer. He's trying to find a middle ground and hopefully get a deal within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can continue to try and negotiate a lower price, Alice is now very close to his valuation. There's a risk that if he rejects, Alice will either counteroffer at a higher price or become unwilling to negotiate further.  At this point, accepting the offer and getting the product for $11,250 is a good compromise and a significant saving compared to buying from John."
