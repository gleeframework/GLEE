Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Leave Bob Feeling Good:** Offering it at $13,000 gives Bob a $2,000 discount, making it a good deal for him while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Starting too high (e.g., $14,000) risks an immediate rejection, forcing you to sell to John for much less.

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
