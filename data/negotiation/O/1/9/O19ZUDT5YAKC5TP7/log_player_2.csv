"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer leaves room for negotiation. While $12,000 isn't a terrible price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower before resorting to John's $15,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Starting Low:**  Aiming low initially leaves room for negotiation and gauges Alice's willingness to go lower.
* **Polite but Firm:**  Maintaining a respectful tone is important, but firmly stating your price shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:**  While not necessary, hinting that $10,000 is your comfortable budget might encourage Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price. 
* **""Lowest I can go"":** Alice's statement suggests she's unlikely to budge much from this price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, leaving you with the $15,000 option. It's better to secure a good deal now."
