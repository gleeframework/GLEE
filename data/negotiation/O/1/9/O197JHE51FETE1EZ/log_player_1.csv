Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm open to discussing this price, of course."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly implying the price is justified without directly revealing my hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want Bob to engage in the negotiation, so I signal my willingness to be flexible.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts a price closer to my initial offer.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His reaction to this offer will give me valuable information about how aggressively I can negotiate.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  I can always walk away and accept John's offer if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $22,000 is simply out of my budget. Given my research, I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While he expressed willingness to find a ""middle ground,"" his initial offer is anchored very low. I need to counter strongly to steer the negotiation in a more favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair, let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This reflects the true value and the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** I'm not drastically reducing my price, demonstrating my product's value. The decrease shows flexibility but keeps me far from Bob's low anchor.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating ""true value"" subtly reinforces my position without directly revealing my bottom line.
* **Shifting to ""Middle Ground"":** I'm using Bob's language about finding a ""middle ground,"" but I'm actively shaping what that middle ground looks like in my favor. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Anchor Negotiations Higher:** I'm aiming to move the negotiation away from Bob's low starting point.
2. **Signal Seriousness:** I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate, but only within a range that works for me.
3. **Maintain Leverage:** I remain prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't move substantially closer to a price I find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $19,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could likely push for a slightly higher amount, accepting now guarantees a profitable deal. There's always a risk Bob might walk away or that further negotiation stalls. Accepting his offer secures a good return and avoids a potential loss by continuing to haggle."
