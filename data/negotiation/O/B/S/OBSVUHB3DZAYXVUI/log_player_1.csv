Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows that I'm willing to compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value Bob sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his reluctance to meet my minimum price makes it clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee my minimum profit."
