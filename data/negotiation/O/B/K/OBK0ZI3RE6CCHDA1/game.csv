"I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would allow you to still make a good profit and would be a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being a good deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1300000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This price is still a good profit for you, and I'm confident I can make this product work for me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was hoping we could get closer to the original offer I made. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1300000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1225000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
