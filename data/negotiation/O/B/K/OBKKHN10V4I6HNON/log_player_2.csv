"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $1,100,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a better price than John's $1,000,000 but still allows you to save some money compared to Alice's initial offer.  It's a good compromise."
