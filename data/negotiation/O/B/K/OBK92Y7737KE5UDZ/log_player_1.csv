"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to pay $10,750.   What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $10,750 is tempting, I still feel like I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than selling to John, so I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  How about $10,900?  It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10900}
