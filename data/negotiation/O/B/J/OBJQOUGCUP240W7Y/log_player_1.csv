Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider that?

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this product will be worth the investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We've been going back and forth for a while, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it seems like we're stuck.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I get the price I need, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
