"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.  Would you consider $950,000? This demonstrates a willingness to meet you closer to the middle ground."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $800,000 is the maximum value for Bob, it's still significantly less than what John is offering and below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss. I'll counter-offer in the next round to see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $800,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider it if you can justify the value this product brings to you.  Could you elaborate on how it would be utilized and its potential impact on your business?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By dropping to $875,000, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise but still maintaining a firm stance above Bob's offer. 
* **Information Gathering:** Encouraging Bob to explain his perceived value will provide insights into his thought process and potential for a higher offer.
* **Maintaining Alternatives:** I'm still open to selling to John, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob at any cost. This knowledge empowers me to negotiate from a stronger position."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be transparent, this product fits a specific need in my business, and at $800,000, it makes strong financial sense.  Above that, the return on investment isn't quite there yet. I'm ready to close the deal at $800,000 if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that his absolute maximum price is $800,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.  Accepting this offer would mean a $400,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
