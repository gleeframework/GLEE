"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.  Would you consider $950,000? This demonstrates a willingness to meet you closer to the middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $800,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider it if you can justify the value this product brings to you.  Could you elaborate on how it would be utilized and its potential impact on your business?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be transparent, this product fits a specific need in my business, and at $800,000, it makes strong financial sense.  Above that, the return on investment isn't quite there yet. I'm ready to close the deal at $800,000 if you're open to it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
