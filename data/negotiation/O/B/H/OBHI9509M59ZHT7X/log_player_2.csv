"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  The product is only worth $120 to Bob, so paying $150 is a bad deal. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but also shows he is willing to negotiate. Starting low gives Bob room to move up in price if needed while still securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still too high.  Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $120 and knows he can get the product from John for that price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and agree on $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of paying as little as possible, but he's also demonstrating willingness to compromise.  By offering $115, he's halfway between his previous offer of $100 and Alice's current offer of $130.  This shows that he's actively trying to reach an agreement and is hoping Alice will meet him in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $115 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  However, it is very close to his limit, and it signals that Alice is becoming more flexible.  There is still room to negotiate a better price, and Bob should try to bring the offer down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. Would you consider $122? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 122}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap and get a better price while still staying within his budget.  Offering $122 is a reasonable compromise, as it's only $3 less than Alice's offer and very close to Bob's maximum. It's a clear signal that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $123. It's a small concession, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still slightly above Bob's maximum price of $120. Bob knows he can get the product from John for that price, and this is a good time to see if Alice is willing to go down to his limit.  There's still a chance to close the deal at a better price, and Bob is willing to take the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. That's my absolute limit, but it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his absolute maximum price. By stating this is his limit, he is putting pressure on Alice to accept the offer. He's confident that Alice wants to make a deal and may be willing to concede to close it."
