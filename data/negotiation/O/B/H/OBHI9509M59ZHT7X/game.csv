,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and agree on $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. Would you consider $122? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $123. It's a small concession, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",123.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. That's my absolute limit, but it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",120.0,Bob,8,
