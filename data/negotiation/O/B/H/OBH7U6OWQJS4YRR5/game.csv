"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a substantial value for you, given its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's start our negotiation with this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This still gives you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $1,150,000? This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
