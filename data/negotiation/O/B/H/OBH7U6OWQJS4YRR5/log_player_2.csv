"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a substantial value for you, given its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's start our negotiation with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. Alice's offer is better than that, but there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This still gives you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $1,150,000? This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. Accepting this offer saves Bob $350,000. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price makes this offer a good compromise."
