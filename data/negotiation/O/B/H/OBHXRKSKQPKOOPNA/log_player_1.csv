"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob. If he rejects, we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $170, at this point, $160 is a good deal for me.  It's better than selling to John, and we're making good progress."
