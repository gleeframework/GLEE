"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $20000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, $20000 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to continue our negotiation with a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this proposal is more within your consideration range.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go below $20000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $19500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I must respectfully decline. Given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet your price of $19500. I will proceed to purchase the product from John for $10000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
