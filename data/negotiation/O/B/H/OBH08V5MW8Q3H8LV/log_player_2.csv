"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  You should reject this offer and make a counteroffer significantly lower, closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, I am aiming to:

* **Signal my budget limitations:**  This lets Alice know I'm serious about a lower price point.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's a good chance for back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoid getting anchored:**  Alice's high initial offer could influence the negotiation. By starting low, I'm less likely to be anchored to a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved closer to a more reasonable price, $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than your $1,000,000 limit and John's offer. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating, but you should signal that Alice needs to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, my absolute maximum is closer to $900,000.  If you can't do that, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a firm boundary:** By presenting $900,000 as your ""absolute maximum,"" you create a stronger sense of urgency and limitation. 
* **Introducing alternatives:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that you have the option of going with John's offer. 
* **Incremental approach:**  While the counteroffer is a significant jump from $800,000, it's important to show willingness to move upward while still aiming for your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $900,000 is too low for me to consider. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a significant discount and I believe a fair price. Let me know if you're willing to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has made it clear that she won't go below $1,250,000. This price is still significantly higher than your $1,000,000 limit and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at a price you're comfortable with."
