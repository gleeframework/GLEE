Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still within the range of what I believe Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that low, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping that he will see the value of the product and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially losing a sale altogether. It's a good compromise, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
