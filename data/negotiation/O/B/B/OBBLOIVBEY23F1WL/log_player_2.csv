Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,062,500.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution at this price."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 was my previous offer, but I can see that you're still not comfortable with that. Let me try to find a sweet spot in the middle. I'll counter with a price of $1,090,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, exceeding your target price of $1,200,000. While she seems to be getting closer, you have more rounds to negotiate and can try to squeeze out a better deal. Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,090,000 is still not in my budget.  Let's aim for a compromise at $1,080,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that benefits both of us and brings us closer to a final deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step down from Alice's latest offer, showing that you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  It also acknowledges that you're getting closer to an agreement, building a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,080,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more counteroffer: $1,095,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, exceeding your budget of $1,200,000. With only a few rounds left, it's not likely that you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This way, you can secure the product at a price that's within your budget, even if it's not the ideal deal."
