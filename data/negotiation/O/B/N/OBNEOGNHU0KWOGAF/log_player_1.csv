Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my minimum acceptable price ($150) creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, the slightly higher price leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested."
