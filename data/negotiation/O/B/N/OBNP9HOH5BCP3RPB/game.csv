"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,750. Would you be willing to consider this price?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we try $14,250?  It's a fair compromise that's a win-win for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but no higher. Would you be willing to consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
