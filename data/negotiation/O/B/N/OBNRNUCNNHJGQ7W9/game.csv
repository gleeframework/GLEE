"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our negotiation so far. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring you great value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your latest offer. While I am eager to reach an agreement, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go a little further to meet your needs. Let's split the difference between our last two offers. How about $1,337,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I am confident this product will bring you excellent value.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
