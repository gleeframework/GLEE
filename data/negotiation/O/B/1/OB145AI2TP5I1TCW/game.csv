"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product in excellent condition, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider my revised offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,
