**Reasoning:**

At this stage, Bob is highly unlikely to agree to a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 minimum. He's consistently made small incremental increases, indicating his unwillingness to budge much further.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for your desired price, so it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Bob."
