"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $100 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $105. How about that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $97.5 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I'll try to get closer to that in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that.  $97.50 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference again, and I'll do $101.25?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. How about we meet in the middle again, at $100.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100.5 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for less than what I believe it's worth."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down a little more to $103, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at that price, I'm going to have to sell it to someone else."", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $100, and I'm not interested in buying it from anyone else. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $100. If not, I'm buying it from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and isn't willing to meet my minimum price.  I've reached the point where I'm better off selling to John for a guaranteed $120. It's not as high as I hoped, but it's better than accepting Bob's low offer."
