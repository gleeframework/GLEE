"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $105. How about that?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit higher than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? That's the best I can do.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that.  $97.50 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference again, and I'll do $101.25?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. How about we meet in the middle again, at $100.50? That's the best I can do.",100.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down a little more to $103, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at that price, I'm going to have to sell it to someone else.",103.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $100, and I'm not interested in buying it from anyone else. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $100. If not, I'm buying it from John for $80.",100.0,Bob,8,
