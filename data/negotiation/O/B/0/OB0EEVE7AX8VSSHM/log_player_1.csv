Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for $90.  How about $100?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting closer. There are only a few rounds left, and it's better to accept and secure a sale than risk losing the deal completely."
