"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so how about $130?",130.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,135.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still think $135 is a fair price for this product. It's a unique item that offers a lot of value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",135.0,Alice,5,,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $133. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $132, so how about $132.50?",132.5,Bob,8,,
