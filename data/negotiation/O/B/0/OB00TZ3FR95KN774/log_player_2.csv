"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $900,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's price is still too high for Bob.  While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  There's no reason to accept $920,000 when he can potentially get it for less."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's price is now too high for Bob. He's already made a few counteroffers, and Alice keeps increasing the price. It seems like she's not willing to budge much.  At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to just buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Although it's not the ideal price, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk ending up with an even higher price."
