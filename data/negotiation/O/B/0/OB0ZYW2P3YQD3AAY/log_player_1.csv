Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) to see if I can get a good deal. I know Bob values the product at $80, so this is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $95 is still a good deal considering he values the product at $80.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or potentially having to sell to John for $100."
