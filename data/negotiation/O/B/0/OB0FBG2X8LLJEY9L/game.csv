"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll still get great value from the product.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than $12,500. How about we try $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to go.  How about we settle on $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I think we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that, but I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can get it for a better price elsewhere.  Would you be willing to drop to $13,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could close this negotiation.",13000.0,Bob,6,
