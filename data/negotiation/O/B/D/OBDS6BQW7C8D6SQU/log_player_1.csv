"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 130} 

I'm starting high because I know Bob values the product significantly. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $110 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to $130. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll truly value."", ""product_price"": 120} 

I'm aiming for a compromise here.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is clearly anchored at $100, and while I'd like to get closer to $120, accepting $100 is still a significant profit over my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
