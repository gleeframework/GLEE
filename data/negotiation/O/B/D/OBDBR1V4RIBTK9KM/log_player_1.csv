Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategically priced. It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but lower than your guaranteed sale price of $1,000,000 with John. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he could potentially save $100,000 compared to buying from John.  It also gives you a chance to maximize your profit, getting closer to your desired value of $1,000,000."
