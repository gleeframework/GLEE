"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $950000. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's potential to get a better price. It's worth trying to get a counteroffer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is slightly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $925000? This still allows us to maintain a good profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your target. You've already shown that you're willing to negotiate and are willing to walk away. There's still room for Alice to come down further.  You have more rounds to negotiate and can still potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to pay $910,000, but I need to stay within that budget. Let's work together to find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear that you're still interested in the product, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'd like to suggest a price of $915000. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while staying competitive in the market. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but you're still within your 10 rounds and you've already shown you're willing to walk away. You're also only $5,000 away from your ideal price. Keep pushing for a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. While I value your product, I'm not quite ready to accept $915,000. I'm still willing to pay $910,000, but I need to remain within that budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $912500. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both our financial positions. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is a reasonable compromise.  You're only $12,500 away from your ideal price and you have a few more rounds to negotiate, but there's a risk that Alice will get stubborn or that you'll run out of rounds before getting a better price.  Accepting this offer is a safe bet, as it's still within your budget and allows you to close the deal."
