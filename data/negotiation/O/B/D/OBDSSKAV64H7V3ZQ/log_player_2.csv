"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is more than what the product is worth to her, it's still less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
