"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John:**  $12,000, which is Bob's absolute limit but not the best deal.

**Strategy:** Reject the offer and counteroffer to try and get a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and Bob can always switch to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about saving money and isn't afraid to negotiate. Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason (""a bit steep"") makes the counteroffer more than just a number.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $8,500 is still above Alice's minimum of $8,000, allowing for some give-and-take."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above $8500.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a significant discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Still to save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $9,250 is still a bit high for Bob, but it's closer to his ideal price.
* **Buying from John:**  $12,000 is still the absolute limit, but not the best deal.

**Strategy:**  Reject Alice's offer and counteroffer again to try and push the price lower.  There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can always switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to go with $9000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying persistent:**  Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about getting the best price.  He's not willing to accept her offer yet.
* **Small increment:**  He's only offering $250 less than Alice's latest offer.  This shows that he's willing to compromise but still wants a good deal.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""closer to a deal"" helps maintain a positive tone and avoid seeming overly aggressive."
