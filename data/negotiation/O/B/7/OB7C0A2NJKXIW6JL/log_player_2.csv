"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to buy the product for $130. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  Bob can likely get a slightly better price with further negotiation, but the risk is that Alice might walk away or Bob might run out of rounds. Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
