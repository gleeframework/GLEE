"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her own valuation than mine. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll aim significantly lower in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  I'm maintaining a polite tone and framing my counteroffer as a difference in our comfort levels, not an attack on her valuation. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get Alice closer to my $8,000 walk-away price. This counteroffer puts that goal within reach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my walk-away price of $8,000. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can't get a better deal from John. Accepting now guarantees I get the product at my target price."
