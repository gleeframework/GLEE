It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can make a counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down in price.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so you have some room to negotiate."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,225,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.
