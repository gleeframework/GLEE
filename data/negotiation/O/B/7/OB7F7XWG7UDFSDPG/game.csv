"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,225,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,212,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1212500.0,Bob,4,
