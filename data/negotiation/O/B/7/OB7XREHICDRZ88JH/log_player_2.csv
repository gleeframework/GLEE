# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.
