"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $140. It's worth more than that to you, and I'm sure you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:** You get the product for $140, which is within your budget of $150 and saves you $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John:** You pay the maximum you're willing to spend ($150) but gain no other benefit. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
