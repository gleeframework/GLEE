"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob, considering the product's worth to him is $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, while still allowing me to earn significantly more than selling to John. I believe this price is fair and will likely be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm offering $108 for the product. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer and still leaves room for some negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that's fair for both of us and likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not the highest price I've been offered, it's still a decent profit and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
