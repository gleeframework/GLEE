"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is closer to her valuation than mine. While it's tempting to secure the product immediately, I have room to negotiate a better price, especially since I have the option to buy from John for $8,000 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price.  This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying if the price is right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to my range, but $8,500 is still above my ideal price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching closer to my upper limit ($8,000) but showing willingness to compromise. This offer is a reasonable midpoint between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous one ($6,000). It keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining pressure to reach a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $7,500 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we meet at $8,000? That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good price for you as well.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my ideal price point, matching what John offers. There's no further benefit to negotiating or going with John at this point. It's time to close the deal."
