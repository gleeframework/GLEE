"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a profit. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $7,500 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we meet at $8,000? That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good price for you as well.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
