Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make a profit. "", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my target price.  $7,500 is still significantly lower than what I want, but I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation yet.  I'm hoping I can get Bob to come up a bit higher in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $7,500 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we meet at $8,000? That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good price for you as well.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
