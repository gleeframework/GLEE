"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this deal and be willing to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming higher.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still holding firm on a significant profit. This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm on a price that gives me a significant profit. I believe that this counteroffer is fair and reasonable, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to John's offer, I'm not ready to give up yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is right in the middle of Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a good profit for myself. I'm confident this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob, as it's better than his last offer and significantly better than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds. Rather than risk another rejection, I'll take John's offer and secure a guaranteed $800,000.  While it's not ideal, it's better than potentially losing the sale entirely."
