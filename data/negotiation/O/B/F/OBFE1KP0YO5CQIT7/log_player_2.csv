Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'll make one more offer, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I'll sell the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has significantly increased her offer, indicating she's unlikely to move closer to my price range. She's also becoming firmer in her stance. It's clear further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. Accepting John's offer of $800,000 is the best option to stay within my budget."
