"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering its true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
