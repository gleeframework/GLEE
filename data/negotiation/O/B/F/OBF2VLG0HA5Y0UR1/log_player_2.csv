# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $9,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer a lower price, $8,500 is a good deal for him and better than buying from John for $12,000."
