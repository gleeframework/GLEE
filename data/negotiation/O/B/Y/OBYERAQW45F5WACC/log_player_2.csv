"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm passionate about and I know you would appreciate its quality. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss details.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, getting closer to her valuation of $8,000."
