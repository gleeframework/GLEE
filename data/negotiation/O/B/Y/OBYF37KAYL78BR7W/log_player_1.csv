"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, close to my ideal price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This will give me a good starting point and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe that a negotiation process will lead to a fair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer.  It's also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
