# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really value. It's worth at least $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
