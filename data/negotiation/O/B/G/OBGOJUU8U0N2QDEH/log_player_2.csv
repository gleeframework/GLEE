"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still more than you're willing to pay, but it's closer to your ideal price of $800,000.  You could continue negotiating, but there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and the price will go back up.  It's more likely you'll save time and get a decent price by accepting her offer."
