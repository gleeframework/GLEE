"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $11,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a little outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That's my absolute maximum. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your maximum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,200? I think it's a fair compromise and will still give you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,200 is still lower than John's offer of $12,000.
* This price is a reasonable compromise, especially since Alice is willing to go below her initial asking price of $11,000.
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,800 compared to buying from John."
