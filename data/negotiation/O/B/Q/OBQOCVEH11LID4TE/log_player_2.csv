Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
