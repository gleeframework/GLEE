"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further than that. Can you meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
