"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'll make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to get, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll throw in a bonus service worth $1000 if you're willing to meet me at $16000. This way, you'll get the product and a value-added service. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the bonus service, but I'm still not willing to pay $16000. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product, and I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",14000.0,Bob,10,
