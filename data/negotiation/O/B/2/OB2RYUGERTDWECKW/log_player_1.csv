Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
