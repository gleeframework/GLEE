"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of the value this product holds for you, and I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000. It's also closer to Bob's ideal price.  While Bob could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might reject again, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
