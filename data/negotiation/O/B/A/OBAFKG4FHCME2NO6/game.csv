"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of the value this product holds for you, and I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
