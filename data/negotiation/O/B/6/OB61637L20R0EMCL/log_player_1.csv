Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and still leaves Bob with a profit margin.  I'm also framing the message in a friendly and optimistic way to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum price of $80.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $85.  This is still above my minimum price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also trying to keep the conversation friendly and positive to increase the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price of $80. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to accept this offer. It's a good deal for me, and it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate.  There's no point in risking a deal by continuing to haggle."
