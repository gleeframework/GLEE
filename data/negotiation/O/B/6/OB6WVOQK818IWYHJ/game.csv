"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a great opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
