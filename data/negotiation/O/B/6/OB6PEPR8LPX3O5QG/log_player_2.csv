"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is still within your budget, it's too close to John's price.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Alice is likely to accept this offer as it's still above her value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still too high for me. I believe I can get a better price, especially since she already rejected my counteroffer. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $87. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. I believe this is a fair price that Alice might accept, given that it's closer to her value of $80."
