"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm sure you can find another buyer willing to pay a little more.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $95, which is $107.50. How about that?",107.5,Alice,5,
