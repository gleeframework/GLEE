"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is less than what the product is worth to him, he can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $135 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
