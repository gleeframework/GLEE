"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he knows he can get it for $10,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still above his budget and he knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has come down to $15,500, which is still higher than Bob's budget. While he could continue to negotiate, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and there's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower her price. It's better to secure the product from John for the guaranteed price of $10,000."
