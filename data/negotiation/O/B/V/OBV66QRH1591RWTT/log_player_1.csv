Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob before accepting John's guaranteed offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd potentially be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still netting Alice a significantly higher profit than John's offer.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""fairness"" and the product's potential value *to Bob*, the message aims to persuade him to accept the offer."
