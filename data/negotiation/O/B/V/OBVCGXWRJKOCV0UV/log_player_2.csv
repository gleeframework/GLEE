The product is way over your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant discount to signal my serious interest while remaining within my budget. This should prompt Alice to consider a more reasonable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than the original offer, it's still outside my budget. I need to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to go lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm offering Alice the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. This shows my commitment to buying the product while also staying within my budget. If Alice rejects, I'll buy from John."

Alice is not budging on her price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget than to risk losing the opportunity altogether."
