Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still giving me a significant profit.
* **Alternative buyer:** I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $9,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is above Bob's valuation, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for counter-offer:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.  
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup ensures I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's too unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth to justify my price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that I have other options and won't settle for a deal that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I could get from John.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still room to negotiate.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can likely get him to go slightly higher.
* **No rush:** I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $11,500. This is a fair compromise that's still within my range.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a smaller concession than Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive phrasing:** I'm using optimistic language like ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Still above John's offer:**  This price is still higher than what I could get from John, giving me some room for potential counteroffers."
