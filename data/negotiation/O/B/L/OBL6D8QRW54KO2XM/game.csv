"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would that be possible?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider a price of $15,000?  I'm confident this product will be very valuable for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could we agree on a price of $11,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
