{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **John as Leverage:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, giving us a strong fallback position.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant potential profit margin while still being enticing to Bob.  It's unlikely Bob would accept a price much higher, knowing he's leaving a lot of value on the table.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  We make a great profit of $400,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** We sell to John for our guaranteed $1,500,000."
