"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $135. This means you can save $15 by negotiating further. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's asking price of $135 and your desired price of $120. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing Alice that you're serious about buying but still want a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  While you could buy from John for $150, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's offer of $140 and your previous offer of $125.  It shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate but still want a lower price. This could potentially lead to a deal that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to your maximum price of $150, but there's no guarantee that further negotiation will get you a better deal. It's now in your best interest to take the guaranteed price from John and avoid the risk of continuing the negotiation.  You can save $5 compared to John's price."
