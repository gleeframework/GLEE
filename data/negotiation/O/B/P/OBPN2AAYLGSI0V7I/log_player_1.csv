I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and what his perceived value might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I'm happy with $15,000, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's low offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob's offer is just $1,000 more than John's offer. I think it's worth it to close the deal with Bob, as it's a better price than selling to John."
