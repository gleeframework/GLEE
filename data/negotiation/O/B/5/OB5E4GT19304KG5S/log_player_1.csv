"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) but not too far above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to create a positive rapport with Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $175, there's a clear space for both of us to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm aware that John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground! "", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a profitable price:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Encourage further negotiation:** The message is still positive and open to further negotiation, aiming to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to sell at that price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for a slightly higher counteroffer from Bob.
* **John is a fallback option:** As before, I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, giving me some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about $145?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise with a slight advantage:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer,  giving a slight advantage while still being close to my minimum.
* **Highlight the benefits of closing the deal:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties and the opportunity to finalize the transaction. 
* **Urgency (slightly):** The question ""What do you say?"" subtly suggests a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations stalling:**  Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks pushing the price even lower, making it less profitable for me.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
