Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if needed. It also gives me a chance to see if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a low offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $78. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $82? This would give us both a good deal, and we can close the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure if I want to negotiate further. How about we settle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$80 is still below my ideal price, but it's a fair offer and it seems like Bob is firm on that price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale than to risk further negotiations and potentially losing the sale to Bob altogether, or ending up selling to John for $120, which is significantly less profitable."
