"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is better than John's, but I believe I can get a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my desired price and is a good deal considering my minimum price is $8,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
