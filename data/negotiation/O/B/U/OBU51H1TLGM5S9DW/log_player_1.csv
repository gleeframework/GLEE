Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same price. There's no need to risk further negotiation when I can secure my desired amount immediately."
