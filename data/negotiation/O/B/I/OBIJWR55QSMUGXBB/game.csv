"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $6,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your offer.  $7,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $7,750?  It's a fair price, considering the value we both know it holds. Let's close this deal.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stick to my budget.  Could you do $7,400?  That's my final offer.",7400.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I can't go lower than $7,500, but at that price, we can both walk away happy. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",7500.0,Alice,7,
