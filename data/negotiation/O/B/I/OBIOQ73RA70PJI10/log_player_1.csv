{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product, but I'm open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about $11,000? Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is still a bit below my minimum, it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it. I've already gone back and forth a couple of times, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
