"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I believe I can't commit to such a high price. Would you consider selling the product for $750,000? I think this would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $850,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it's a significant compromise from my original offer.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle at $825,000? This would allow us to both benefit from the transaction without straining our budgets too much.",825000.0,Bob,4,
