With its exceptional features and durability, it's truly a valuable asset. I believe you'll find its worth far exceeds its price. Considering its quality and benefits, I propose we agree on a fair price of $120. This allows us both to benefit from this transaction while ensuring you receive a product that will serve you well. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
