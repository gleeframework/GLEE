"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $100 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $95 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to pay more than $92.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?,92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to come down to $100 one last time.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can go.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $100, and I'm not going to go any higher than $92.50. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",92.5,Bob,8,
