"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000? This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the product's potential warrants it.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is the highest price I can pay and still stay within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
