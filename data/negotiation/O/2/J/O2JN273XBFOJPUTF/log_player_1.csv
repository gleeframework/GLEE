Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that you value the product highly but are potentially open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is assertive and assumes Bob highly values the product.
* Bob might be put off by the high price and refuse to negotiate.
* Gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style to tailor your approach further."
