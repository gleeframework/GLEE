"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $80 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too much for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $80.  Let's see if we can make this work.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $80.  Would you be willing to do $120?  That's a significant discount from my original asking price.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
