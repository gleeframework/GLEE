"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($100). There's room for negotiation and potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can make it work."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to compromise, $125 is still above my personal value limit for the product.  There's still room for further negotiation, especially considering the product is worth $100 to Alice. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  That's a good deal for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $115. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $122? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122 is still higher than my ideal price, it's closer to my personal value limit of $150 for the product.  Alice has shown willingness to compromise, and I'm confident that if I reject this offer, further negotiations might take us closer to the $150 mark, potentially leading to a situation where I'd be better off buying from John. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision, given the potential risks and the fact that it's a good price considering the circumstances."
