"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of room to negotiate, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1600000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not at my target price. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from another seller.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
