"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This exceptional item holds significant value for me, but considering its importance to you, I believe it's a perfect match. I am offering it to you at a special price of $9,500, aiming to ensure both parties benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if this proposal suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than your maximum budget of $10,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John for $10,000."
