"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $120. It's the absolute most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering what we both value the product at.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $120, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
