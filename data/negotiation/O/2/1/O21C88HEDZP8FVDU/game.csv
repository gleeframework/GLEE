"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of the true value this product brings. I'm confident it will yield significantly higher returns for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This revised offer reflects my strong belief in the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to my business. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go above $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits the product will bring to my business. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
