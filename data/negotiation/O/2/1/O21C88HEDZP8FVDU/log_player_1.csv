Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very consistently sticking to a pattern of incremental increases.  It's unlikely he'll drastically deviate from this pattern in the remaining rounds.  At this rate, the final offer is unlikely to be significantly higher than $975,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob for a potentially small gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees the full value and avoids further negotiation."
