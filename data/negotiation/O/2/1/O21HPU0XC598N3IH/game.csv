"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'd be happy to make a purchase at that price.",180.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $220. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $200? I think that's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to make a purchase at that price.",200.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, I'm getting close to my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher.
