"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth significantly more to me than $900,000, and I'm confident it holds a similar value for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
