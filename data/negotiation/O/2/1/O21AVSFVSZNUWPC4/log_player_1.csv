"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know the product is worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my value.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer of $10,500, but I believe we can still find a price that suits both parties. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a significant distance from my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that low. I'm hoping to convince Bob to go a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $10,000 is definitely a step in the right direction, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we settle on $11,000? That way we both get a deal that works for us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm hoping to see if I can squeeze out just a bit more from Bob.  The risk of selling to John is still a factor, but I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll come down to $11,250. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction without further delay. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer of $11,250. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're very close to a deal now, and the risk of selling to John is becoming more and more real. While $11,000 isn't my ideal price, it's only $250 away from my last offer and is a better deal than the $10,500 offer in the previous round.  I'm choosing to accept this offer to close the deal with Bob before I risk losing him altogether."
