{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but not too high to scare Bob off right away. I'm also trying to create a positive tone to encourage him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is my minimum, and I'm hoping to get more.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  It's still a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $110 is a good compromise and still above my minimum. It's also a better price than what I'd get from John."
