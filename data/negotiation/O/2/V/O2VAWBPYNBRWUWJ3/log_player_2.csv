"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting at a reasonable price, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about I sell the product to you for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I think there's still a bit more wiggle room. I'll reject and propose a price closer to her offer to encourage her to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $92? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 92
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a good discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $93. Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down quite a bit, and $93 is a good price for the product. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and I'm happy to save $27."
