"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I'm flexible on this price.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $137.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $142.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time here, but I'll give it one more shot. I'll meet you at $140, that's as high as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll just have to go with John's offer of $100.",140.0,Bob,6,
