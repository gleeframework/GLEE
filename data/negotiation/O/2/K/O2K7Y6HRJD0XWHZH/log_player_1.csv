Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, as he knows the product is worth less to him. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate further.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum desired price.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The actual negotiation process will depend on Bob's response and how willing I am to compromise to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we set the product price at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer, I'm not yet ready to settle for that amount.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There's still potential to secure a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and explore if there's room for compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell and have alternative options. This strengthens my negotiating position.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $950,000 and my minimum price of $1,200,000.  The specific amount will depend on my assessment of Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that leaves both of us with a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but it still keeps the price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,050,000 is a reasonable price for Bob, as it's significantly less than what he'd pay John. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not immediately accepting his offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and still have some negotiating power.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the product price at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my goal:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk is that Bob might walk away completely, leaving me with John's offer as my only option.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively painless sale.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the deal with Bob, securing a price that's closer to my desired amount than John's offer."
