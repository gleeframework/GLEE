{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate a better price.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer opens the door to potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully will encourage Alice to come down in price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for a better deal. By rejecting, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. The risk of buying from John is always present, but Bob is willing to take a few more rounds to see if he can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally offered a price within Bob's target range. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than John's, while still securing a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
