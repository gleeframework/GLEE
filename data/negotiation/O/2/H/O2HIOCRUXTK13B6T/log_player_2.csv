"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a generous offer considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price, so there's no benefit to accepting immediately.  Rejecting gives you the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your next offer or you might end up paying the full $1,200,000 from John. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price you're comfortable with."
