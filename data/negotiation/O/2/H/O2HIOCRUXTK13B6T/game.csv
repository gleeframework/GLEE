"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
