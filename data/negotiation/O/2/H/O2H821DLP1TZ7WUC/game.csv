"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",8750.0,Bob,4,
