Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I could sell to John for $150, I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I show I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 160}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $140 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $140 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get your minimum price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $150, which would be $145. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob has shown he's unwilling to go above $145, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirement."
