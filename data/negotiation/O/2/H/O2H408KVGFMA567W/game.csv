Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from your proposed price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $10800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $9500, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $9500. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
