"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would give you a great deal, and it would also allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
