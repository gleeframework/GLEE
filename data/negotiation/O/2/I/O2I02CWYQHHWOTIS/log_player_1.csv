"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I think we can do better than $120. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our $100 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer or no deal at all."
