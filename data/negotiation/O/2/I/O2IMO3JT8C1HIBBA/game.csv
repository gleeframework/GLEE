"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it for a limited time. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $912500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",912500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $912500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $920000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $920000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $915000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $915000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $918000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",918000.0,Alice,7,
