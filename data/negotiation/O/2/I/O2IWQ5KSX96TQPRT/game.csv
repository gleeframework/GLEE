"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product,  which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the potential value of the product.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we aim for $1,050,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to reach a final agreement. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I hope you will accept this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I still think I can get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that John's offer might be more attractive, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
