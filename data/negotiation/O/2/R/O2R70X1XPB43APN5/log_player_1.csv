Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $12,000. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $12,000, which is my minimum.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering $11,000 to Bob. This is a price that's higher than his value but lower than mine. 

**Outcome:** 
* **If Bob accepts:** I earn a profit of $1,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum.

**This strategy maximizes my potential earnings by trying to secure a higher price from Bob while still having a backup option to ensure I receive my minimum value.**"
