I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'd like to see if I can get more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort. I'm willing to accept John's offer of $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's more than Bob is willing to pay, and guarantees I don't lose money."
