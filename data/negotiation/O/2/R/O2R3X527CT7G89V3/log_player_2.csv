"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  It's way above your budget.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Starting at your maximum budget is a good strategy.  Alice may reject this, but it establishes your starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to your budget, it's still not ideal.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to meet your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer represents a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you are willing to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and closer to your desired price. It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up buying from John for $8,000."
