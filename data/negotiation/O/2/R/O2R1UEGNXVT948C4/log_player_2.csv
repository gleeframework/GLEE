Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
Alice is very unlikely to go below $78 at this point, and it's not worth the risk of her going even higher in the next round. Buying from John for $80 ensures you get the product and don't overpay."
