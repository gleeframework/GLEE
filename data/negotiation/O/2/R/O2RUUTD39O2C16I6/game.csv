"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my initial asking price. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to my range, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to go up to $1500000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
