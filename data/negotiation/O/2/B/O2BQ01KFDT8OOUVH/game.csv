"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,150,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. How about $1,175,000? This keeps us close to the middle ground and reflects the value this product will bring you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,100,000 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, but I need to be upfront.  I can't accept anything less than $1,160,000 for this product. It's a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward at this price.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but $1,160,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's worth to me.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
