"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is beyond my budget.  Given my maximum value for this product is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this offer represents a significant compromise and still reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good deal for both of us.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
