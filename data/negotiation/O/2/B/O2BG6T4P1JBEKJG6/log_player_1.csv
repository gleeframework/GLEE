Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move forward, I could consider $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still significantly below what John is offering. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so let's see if we can inch him closer to at least $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I could do $1,000,000. This seems fair given your initial offer and my ideal price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

This is the point where we need to accept.  Bob has met our minimum acceptable price (matching John's offer).  Continuing to push for more might make him walk away, and we'd end up with the same amount from John anyway."
