Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum value, Bob's initial offer is significantly lower than my first offer. I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up on his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go too far below my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my initial asking price than my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get closer to $18,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and close the sale."
