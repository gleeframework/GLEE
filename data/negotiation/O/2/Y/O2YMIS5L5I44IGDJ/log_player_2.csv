"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking of a price around $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so you have time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. It also leaves some room for negotiation, as I have several rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is a good starting point for negotiation, but it's still above my desired price. I have 7 rounds remaining, so I'll try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further step towards my goal price. I've offered a price that's still above Alice's likely bottom line, but leaves room for negotiation. I've also emphasized my interest in the product to encourage Alice to reach an agreement."
