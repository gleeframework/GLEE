"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($65) than Alice's initial price ($100). This leaves us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Politeness:** We maintain a polite and friendly tone to foster a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justification:** We briefly mention our budget as a reason for the lower offer, without revealing our absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Still Above Target:** Alice's counteroffer of $85 is still above our target price of $80.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're only in Round 3, giving us ample opportunity to negotiate further and potentially reach our desired price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the security of John's offer at $80 if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're proposing a price that's roughly halfway between our last offer ($65) and Alice's current offer ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Framing as ""Fair"":**  By using the phrase ""meet in the middle,"" we position our counteroffer as a reasonable and equitable solution.
* **Maintaining Interest:** We continue to express interest in the product, signaling to Alice that we're serious about reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $75, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $80. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches Target Price:** Alice's offer of $80 matches our target price and what John is offering.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower. She's indicated this is her lowest price.
* **Saves Time and Effort:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and the risk of Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
