Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to ensure a sale to Bob, a price closer to his perceived value would be more appropriate."
