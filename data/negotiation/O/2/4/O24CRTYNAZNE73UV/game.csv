"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but $975,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to be able to get at least $1,000,000 for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $990,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
