{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation ($100) but below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $105?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $105 is too low. I need to make at least $120 to make this worthwhile.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean the negotiation is over. I can make a counteroffer and try to find a price we both agree on.
* **I'm not desperate:**  I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $110?  That's still a great price for this amazing product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $115 to $110. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that $110 is still a good deal.
* **Reiterating My Needs:** I'm subtly stating that I need to make at least $110 to make this worthwhile, setting the stage for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with a compromise, Bob's offer of $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already made concessions, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and a guaranteed profit. 

While I could continue negotiating, it's riskier.  There's no guarantee Bob will eventually meet my price, and time is valuable.  Selling to John provides a quick, secure solution that meets my financial goals."
