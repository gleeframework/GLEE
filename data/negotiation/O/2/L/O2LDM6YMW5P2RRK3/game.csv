"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1,300,000.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?  I think this is a fair price that considers both of our interests.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
