"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This initial offer is meant to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm still aiming for a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,800,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a good compromise and is close to my target. While I could potentially get a higher price in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
