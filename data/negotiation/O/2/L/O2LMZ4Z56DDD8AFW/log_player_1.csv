Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product without explicitly stating why I've chosen this price. This allows Bob to counter-offer without feeling like I've inflated the price arbitrarily. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and invites Bob's input (""What do you think?""), signaling a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still maintaining a professional and respectful negotiation approach."
