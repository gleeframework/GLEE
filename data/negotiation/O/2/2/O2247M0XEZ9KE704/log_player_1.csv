{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering you. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer.  I'm asking $1,800,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still achieve a good price.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but your initial price is out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John."

It's a good price for a product with so much potential. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly holding onto his $1,000,000 offer, and I'm still not willing to go below my minimum of $1,200,000.  With 6 rounds remaining, I'm not desperate enough to accept his offer. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can budge him closer to my target price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for continuing to negotiate. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  To demonstrate my sincerity, I'm willing to offer $1150000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**
