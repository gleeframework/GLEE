It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has declared $14,000 as her ""final offer."" Even if you could negotiate a bit further, it's unlikely you'll get significantly below that.
* **You're at your limit:**  $12,000 is your maximum budget. Spending more means overspending, even if you get the product from Alice.
* **John is a guaranteed win:** You have a sure thing with John at $12,000.  Why risk losing the product or overspending when you have a guaranteed win on the table?"
