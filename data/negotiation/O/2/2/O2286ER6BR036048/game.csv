"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $17,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of the product. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $17,000 is still outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500?  I believe that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
