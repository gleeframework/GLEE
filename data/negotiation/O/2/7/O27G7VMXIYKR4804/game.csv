"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
