"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $10,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This offer represents a significant reduction from your initial price, and it's the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my target, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can bring the price down further. If it doesn't work, I'm ready to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit stretched at $9,500. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9,250 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm thinking of $9,750. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is still above my budget and only $500 away from my initial rejection point of $9,250. There are only a few rounds left and I don't see much room for negotiation. It's best to buy the product from John for $8,000 and save time and effort."
