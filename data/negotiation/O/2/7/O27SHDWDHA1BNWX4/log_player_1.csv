Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This offer represents a significant reduction from your initial price, and it's the highest I can go at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit stretched at $9,500. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to pay $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9,250 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm thinking of $9,750. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}"
