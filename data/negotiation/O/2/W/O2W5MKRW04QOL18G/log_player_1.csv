"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1300000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also leaving room for negotiation in case he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds left and I'm still in a strong position.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm offering a price that's very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still slightly higher. I'm showing a willingness to compromise while keeping in mind my own financial goals. With only five rounds left, I need to be strategic and move closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great opportunity!  Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price. I've already rejected his offers in previous rounds, so I'm confident that he's serious about this offer.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle with John for the same price."
