{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum limit.** There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  You might be able to get a better price by counteroffering.
* **Buying from John offers no advantage.**  He's selling at your maximum, so there's no point in going to him yet."

Alice's offer:
