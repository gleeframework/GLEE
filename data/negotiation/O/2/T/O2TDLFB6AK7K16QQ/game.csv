"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value, I'm not comfortable with the starting price. I'm willing to consider purchasing at $750000.  This reflects my initial assessment of the product's worth and leaves room for us to find common ground. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $750000 is below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to reflect your interest and facilitate a deal.  This leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down. While I see the value of the product, $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000, which is a significant step closer to your offer. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
