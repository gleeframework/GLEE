"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price that's sure to be a great deal for both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and increase your chances of getting the product for a lower price from Alice."
