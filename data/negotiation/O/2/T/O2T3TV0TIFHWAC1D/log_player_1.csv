"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John, so I'm not desperate yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John, so I'm in a good position to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a little too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,350. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9350}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although $9,250 is getting very close to my minimum, I still have 4 rounds left and the option to sell to John. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more before accepting."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to budge from his offer.  While I'd like to get a bit more, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible price."
