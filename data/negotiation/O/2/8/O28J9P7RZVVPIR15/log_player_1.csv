Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is high but not outrageous. This allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price closer to our ideal selling point. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** If Bob rejects our offer, we have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000, ensuring we don't lose out."
