"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  Given its potential impact, I'm setting the price at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget right now.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to facilitate this deal. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
