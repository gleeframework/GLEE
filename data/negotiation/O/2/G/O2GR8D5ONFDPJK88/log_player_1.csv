Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your safety net.
* **Value-focused language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially influencing his perception and justifying the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in discussion and potentially counter-offer.  

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

1. **Testing Bob's willingness to pay:** The high initial price gauges how much Bob might be willing to spend.
2. **Leaving room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's space to lower the price, potentially reaching a deal above $15,000.
3. **Securing a profitable sale:** If Bob ultimately rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum price."
