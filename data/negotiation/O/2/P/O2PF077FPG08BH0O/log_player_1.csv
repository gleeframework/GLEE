"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, as it reflects the significant value this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price helps frame the negotiation. Emphasizing the product's ""potential"" and ""value"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Leaving Room:**  While aiming high, the offer is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), giving him a potential incentive to negotiate rather than walk away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while also providing a fair profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above your minimum, it's still considerably lower than his perceived value of the product. You have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,100,000. 

You still have plenty of rounds left, and selling to John at this point would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,110,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's price but is still significantly above his initial offer.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the idea of ""true value,"" subtly pushing back on Bob's lower valuation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps the negotiation moving and avoids a stalemate that could lead Bob to walk away or make smaller concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,110,000 is still above my target.  I'd like to offer $1,080,000. This represents a compromise that allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards your desired price range. While $1,080,000 is tempting, you're still early in the negotiation. Holding out for a slightly higher price, closer to $1,100,000, is a calculated risk worth taking.  You can afford to be a bit more patient and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,095,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the value you've recognized in the product while allowing me to feel good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1095000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This counteroffer represents a smaller concession than previous rounds, signaling that you're reaching the upper limit of your flexibility.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a price that benefits both parties, reinforcing the collaborative nature of the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer still keeps the potential profit above $95,000 over your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for a final small concession if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little higher than my target, though.  To meet in the middle, I'd like to offer $1,085,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,085,000 provides a very good profit margin ($85,000 above your minimum).
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After six rounds, both parties are likely experiencing some negotiation fatigue. Accepting now prevents potential stalemates or Bob lowering his offer further.
* **Time Value:**  While you have more rounds, securing the deal now eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or you misjudging the remaining negotiation space. 
* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  Accepting at this point leverages that position to your advantage."
