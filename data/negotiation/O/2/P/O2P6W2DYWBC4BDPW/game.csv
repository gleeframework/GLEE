"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I have a budget constraint that I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and respecting my need for a significant return on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, I'm still seeking something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $1,100,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
