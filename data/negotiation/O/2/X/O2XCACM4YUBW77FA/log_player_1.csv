Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While knowing Bob's valuation helps, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  We don't want to start at $15,000 even though that's our safety net with John. A slightly lower price makes us appear flexible and willing to make a deal. 
* **Justification:** By saying ""a great deal"" and  ""perfect for you,"" we aim to create a sense of value for Bob, even though the price is significantly higher than what he ideally wants to pay.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  We get $14,000, which is a great profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** We have room to go down a bit, potentially settling around $12,000-$13,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** We sell to John for our guaranteed $15,000."
