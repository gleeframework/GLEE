"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for a comfortable profit for you.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
