# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth $1300000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1150000 is significantly below what this product is worth. To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle on $1225000? This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000."
