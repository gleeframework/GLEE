# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
