Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $125. This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to stay within my spending limit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
