"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and value, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $140. This offer allows me to fairly compensate for the product while providing you with a reasonable saving compared to its market value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than the product's worth to Alice ($150), it's still above your maximum budget of $120. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth attempting to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $125. This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to stay within my spending limit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
