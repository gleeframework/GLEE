I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident the product is worth more to him than my minimum $1,500,000, but I need to test the waters.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. While tempting to accept, I believe I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about selling, but also that I still value the product higher than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum, and I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of further negotiation delaying a sale and the potential for Bob to back out entirely is too high.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
