Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than what I initially offered, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While I would have preferred to sell it to Bob for a higher price, his final offer of $90 is below my minimum value. Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $100, it's the most sensible option."
