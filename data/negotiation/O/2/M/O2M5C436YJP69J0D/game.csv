"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $150 to you. Considering its value to you, I would like to propose a price of $120 for it. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a reasonable price.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its value to me.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'd like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. This price reflects both the value you place on it and the value I believe it holds.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay and the value you're placing on the product. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. To try and reach an agreement, I am willing to set the price at $90 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you see in it while remaining within my desired range. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $87 for the product.  It's a fair compromise that acknowledges your value and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. In light of your latest offer, I am willing to agree on a price of $89 for the product. This price is slightly above your last offer but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $89 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $87. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",87.0,Bob,8,
