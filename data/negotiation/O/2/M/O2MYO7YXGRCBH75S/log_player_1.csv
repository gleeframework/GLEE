""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it at that price or lower guarantees a sale but leaves money on the table.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy. It's significantly less than our guaranteed sale to John, but still a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
