"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and signals that we value the product highly.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and our belief in its worth, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Future Rounds:** This initial high offer provides a benchmark for future rounds. We can gradually lower the price while gauging Bob's interest and counteroffers.

By starting high, we aim to maximize our potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our acceptable range, it's still significantly lower than our desired profit. We are willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. 

We believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $2,000,000. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that we're serious about the product's value while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It shows you're serious about this product. While I recognize your perspective on the market value, I believe this particular item offers unique advantages that justify a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product and leaves room for a win-win situation."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and perspective to show we're engaging in good faith.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We hold our ground near the $2,000,000 mark, emphasizing the product's unique value.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** By stating our desire for a ""win-win,"" we reinforce our willingness to negotiate while still seeking a strong profit.

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a focus on the product's higher value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below our $2,000,000 target and uncomfortably close to John's standing offer. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if a reasonable price isn't reached.  We'll use the next round to present a final offer, making it clear that it's our best and final attempt."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your latest offer carefully. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiations. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,900,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:**  We introduce the presence of John (without revealing his offer price) to create a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Final Offer:** By explicitly stating this is our ""final offer,"" we signal to Bob that we're serious and won't go lower.
* **Compromise:** We make a significant concession from $2,000,000 to $1,900,000, showing flexibility but holding firm above John's offer. 

This message aims to bring the negotiation to a head. Bob needs to decide if the product is worth this price to him, knowing that he might lose the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer, and I understand that you have another buyer interested. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,650,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can understand my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is too close to John's standing offer of $1,500,000. Continuing the negotiation with Bob offers a decreasing chance of a significantly better outcome.

It's time to cut our losses. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to an even lower final price."
