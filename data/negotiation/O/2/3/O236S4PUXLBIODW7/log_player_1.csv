"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a price that is a bit more than the product is worth to me. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to lower the price in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my value than Bob's.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll keep negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, but I'm starting to consider selling to John if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's unlikely to get a better deal and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
