"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than the product's worth to her, it's still more than your $80 limit. You can get a better deal by going with John."
