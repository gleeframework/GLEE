"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, appreciate the compromise.  $13500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12000.  If that's not acceptable, I'm ready to go with John.",12000.0,Bob,4,
