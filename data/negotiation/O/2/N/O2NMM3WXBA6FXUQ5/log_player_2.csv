"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $175 when you can get it from John for $100.  The strategy is to counteroffer Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering Alice the minimum I'm willing to pay, as I know I can get the product from John for that price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $125 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what John is offering. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a guaranteed deal with John."
