"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $15000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it holds significant value for you as well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $12000 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. There's still time to get a better deal, and Bob knows he can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  This would be a good deal for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 12750}
