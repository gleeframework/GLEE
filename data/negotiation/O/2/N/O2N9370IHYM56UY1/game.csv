"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is tempting, it's significantly below the product's worth.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $750,000. This price reflects the value I'm offering and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $750,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
