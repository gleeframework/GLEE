"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $14,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I have a few rounds left to try and get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but if I don't get closer to my target, I'm willing to sell to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is too low, especially considering the product is worth $15,000 to him. I still have a few rounds left to try and get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise.  If it doesn't work, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,750, so how about $11,375? That's the lowest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and allows me to close the deal with a profit. It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
