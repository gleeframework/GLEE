"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $12,250? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  I'm not willing to go lower than that, but I think it's a good compromise.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. I really don't want to sell to John at a lower price, so I hope we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,750, so how about $11,375? That's the lowest price I'm willing to pay.",11375.0,Bob,8,
