{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we start at $10,000? Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,000. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is within my budget and quite close to my last counteroffer.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid potentially losing the deal."
