"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $18,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping we can reach a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $16,500, which is only $500 less than my last counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept this offer. It's a good price, and I'm not sure I can push him higher."
