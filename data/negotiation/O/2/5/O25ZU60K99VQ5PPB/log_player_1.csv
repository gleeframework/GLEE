Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still get a decent price. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm prepared to potentially make counteroffers if necessary, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option to ensure I don't settle for a price too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still acknowledging his financial constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is a compromise. It's a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's initial offer. 
* The message remains positive and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I'm aiming for a quick resolution but remain prepared for additional rounds if necessary. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,500 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and allows me to stay within my budget. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially lowering my final price.  It's more advantageous to sell to John, ensuring I get the best possible deal for my product."
