"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,000?  That's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still a little hesitant at $13,500, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  How about we settle on $14,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value your willingness to negotiate,  $13,750 isn't quite hitting my target. Would you consider $14,000?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13800.0,Bob,8,
