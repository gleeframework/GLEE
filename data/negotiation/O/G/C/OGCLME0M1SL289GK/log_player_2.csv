"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at your desired price."
