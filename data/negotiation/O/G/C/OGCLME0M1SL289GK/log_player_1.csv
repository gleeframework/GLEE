Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. A price closer to $1,000,000 might be insulting and easily rejected.  $1,150,000 splits the difference, offering a potential win-win.
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to be polite and collaborative, suggesting the price is a starting point for discussion."
