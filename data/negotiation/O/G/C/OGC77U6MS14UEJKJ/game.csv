"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
