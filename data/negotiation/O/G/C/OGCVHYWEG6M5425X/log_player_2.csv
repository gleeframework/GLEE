"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We believe it's a game-changer and would like to offer it to you for $1,100,000. We're confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. While it's lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. It's a bold move, but it might push Alice to reconsider. This also provides a starting point for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and try to get the price down even further. He's still in a good position because he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing the exact price John is offering. This is a strategic move for a few reasons:

* **Pressure:** It puts pressure on Alice to accept, knowing that Bob has a backup option.
* **Finality:** It signifies that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't go any higher.
* **Minimizing Risk:** It avoids potentially losing the deal by rejecting a price that's right at his budget limit. 

If Alice rejects, Bob can still buy from John, ensuring he gets the product at his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we still need to make sure we're getting a fair price for the product. We're willing to meet you at $1,020,000. We believe this is the best compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still slightly above his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. There's a good chance Alice will come down even further, and Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a fair price, but $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,010,000, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement on this, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, showing Bob's willingness to compromise.  He's still within his budget, but it's close enough that Alice might see it as a good final price. The message also emphasizes the finality of the offer, hinting that Bob is prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we understand your concerns, and we're willing to make one more concession. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1,015,000. This is our final offer, and we hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget.  Given that they've been negotiating for several rounds and there are only a few rounds left, it's not likely that Alice will come down to Bob's preferred price.  

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. He's guaranteed the product at his maximum price, and he avoids risking a potential stalemate with Alice."
