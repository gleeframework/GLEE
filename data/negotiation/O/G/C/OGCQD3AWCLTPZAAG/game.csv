"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the fact that it's still above your minimum.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  This way we can both walk away happy.",800000.0,Bob,4,
