I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses, keeping in mind John's offer of $100 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum price, Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I can adjust my counteroffer based on how much Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is still a good price for me, considering my minimum price and John's offer. It's also a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to pay a little more to avoid losing the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer,  it's only $10 less than my minimum acceptable price and I risk losing the deal altogether if I keep rejecting his offers.  Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit."
