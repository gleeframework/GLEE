"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $155. That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think $155 is a good compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $165. It's still a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",165.0,Alice,5,
