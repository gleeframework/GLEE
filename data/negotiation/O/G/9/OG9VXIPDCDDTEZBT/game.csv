"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now. I'm willing to offer $775000 for the product, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",775000.0,Bob,4,
