"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
