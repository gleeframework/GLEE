Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer you the product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is strongly hinting that she won't go much lower than $11,000.  While we could try to negotiate a bit more, it's unlikely we'll get her close enough to our $8,000 limit.  John offers a guaranteed price that saves us a significant amount of money. It's time to cut our losses with Alice and secure the product from John."
