"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, but lower than what John would pay. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation,  inviting Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while being aware of the potential fallback with John. This high initial offer allows for a potential win-win scenario, where I get a good price and Bob still gets a product worth more to him than the price he pays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the gap between our desired prices. I'll likely use this round to adjust my offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a safety net if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. This product is truly unique and offers significant value.  Would you be willing to come up slightly? "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise from my initial price, but still aiming for a profit closer to John's offer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value, hoping to justify the higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:** By asking if he's willing to come up slightly, I'm inviting him to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground. I'm aiming for a price that is still profitable for me but also appealing enough for Bob to consider. I'm also using this round to assess Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit far off. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and I'm still very close to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer one more time, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to come up a bit more. If not, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to guarantee my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  We're almost there!  I believe this product is a valuable investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a significant compromise from my previous offer, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a respectable profit. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential ROI for Bob, hoping to emphasize the long-term benefits.
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm using language like ""almost there"" and ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to feel like we're nearing an agreement.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground in this round. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to guarantee my desired profit. However, I'm trying to push Bob just a bit more to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but not close enough. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a much more secure and desirable outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed profit over the risk of continuing negotiations.  The potential for a higher price is not worth the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting my final offer or taking too long to finalize the deal.  I believe John is the more reliable option at this point."
