"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",15500.0,Alice,5,
