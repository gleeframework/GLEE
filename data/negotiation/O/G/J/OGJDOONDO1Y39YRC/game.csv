"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,450,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,225,000 is simply not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come closer to our desired price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $1,250,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This is my final offer. If you aren't willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not sure if I can meet you at $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me there?",1280000.0,Bob,8,
