Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $120 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially landing on a price higher than $80.
* **Above Our Minimum:**  Even if Bob accepts the $120 offer, we are still making a profit above our minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Alternative Option:**  If Bob rejects our offer, we have the safety net of selling to John for $150, ensuring we don't lose out."
