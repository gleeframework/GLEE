"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your current budget constraints, I would like to counter your offer with a suggestion of $10,500. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's value, but I believe it offers a fair compromise. Please let me know if this revised price works for you, or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",10500.0,Alice,3,
