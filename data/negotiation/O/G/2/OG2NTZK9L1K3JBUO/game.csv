"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking interest in the product. However, $60 is quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $90? It's still a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $85. This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $80, and it gives me a bit closer to my minimum.",85.0,Alice,5,
