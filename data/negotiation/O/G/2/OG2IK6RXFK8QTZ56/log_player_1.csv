Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $11,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is just too low. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
