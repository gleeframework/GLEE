"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer ($1,300,000) closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to make the offer more enticing. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning a ""fair starting point"" and hinting at the ""return on investment"" provides Bob with a reason to consider the high price without revealing our hand entirely. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the negotiation door open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a tempting profit, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to engage and potentially pay more than his initial proposal. Rejecting now keeps the door open for a better deal without being overly aggressive. We have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your perspective."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and express appreciation for his engagement, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Compromise:** We counter with a price that's a compromise ($1,250,000) but still closer to our initial offer. This shows flexibility while holding firm on our desired value.
* **Value Reinforce:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point.

This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob towards a more favorable agreement while keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below your target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 represents a solid profit, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin. While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are likely to be incremental at this point. Accepting now secures a favorable deal and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations that could lead to a stalemate."
