"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I'm still very interested in the product, I'm not quite ready to go that high yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  I believe this is a fair price that would be mutually beneficial.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other opportunities.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
