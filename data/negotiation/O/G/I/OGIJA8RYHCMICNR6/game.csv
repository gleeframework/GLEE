"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to discuss further to see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's unique qualities and potential returns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
