"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
