I'm still not willing to pay that much, I'll reject the offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $14,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

Alice is getting closer to my price but $15,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll go with John and get the product for $10,000."
