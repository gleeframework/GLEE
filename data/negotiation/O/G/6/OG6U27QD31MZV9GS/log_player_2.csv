{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $110, and it's still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer signals Bob's willingness to negotiate and aims to find a price that's fair for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a successful transaction while saving money compared to buying from John."
