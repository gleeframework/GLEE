"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000 and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, there's no advantage to negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John immediately ensures you get the product without the risk of a longer negotiation."
