Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant return on your investment while recognizing the worth of what I'm offering. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We know our fallback is $800,000 from John, so we're not desperate and can afford to aim high.

**The message strikes a balance between confidence, value proposition, and a touch of negotiation space to encourage a deal.**"
