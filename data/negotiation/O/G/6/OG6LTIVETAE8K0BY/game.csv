"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is certainly appealing,  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? This still represents a significant saving for you on a product you value at $1,500,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,050,000 is a more reasonable price for me. This is still a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we settle on $1,075,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
