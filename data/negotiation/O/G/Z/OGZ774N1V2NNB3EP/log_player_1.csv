"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept $8,750, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference at $8,875? This would allow us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
