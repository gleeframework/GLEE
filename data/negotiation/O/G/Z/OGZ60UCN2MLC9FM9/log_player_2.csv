"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your position, but $20,000 is really my bottom line for this product. It represents significant value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has lowered the price slightly, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob has a better option with John, so there's no reason to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $17,000. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to let go of this valuable product knowing it's in good hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price,  he can still get the product from John for less. It's worth trying to push for a lower price before going with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is closer but still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $16,500? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
