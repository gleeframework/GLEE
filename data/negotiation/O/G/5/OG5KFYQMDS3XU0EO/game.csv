"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $12,500, and I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if that works for you!",12500.0,Alice,5,
