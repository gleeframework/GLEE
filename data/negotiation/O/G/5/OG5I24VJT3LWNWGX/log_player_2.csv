Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. This is my final offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling firmness:** Her language (""final offer,"" ""explore other options"") suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **The price is reasonable:** $1,150,000 is a decent saving on your $1,500,000 alternative with John.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** You're running out of time to negotiate further, and risking reaching an impasse. 

While you might be able to squeeze a slightly better price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential benefit."
