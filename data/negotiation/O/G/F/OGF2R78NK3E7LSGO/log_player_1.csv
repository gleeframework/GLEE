Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
