"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject the offer. It's still above your maximum budget, and you have leverage with John's offer at $10,000. You can counteroffer Alice and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's true value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.
