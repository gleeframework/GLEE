Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [describe product briefly and its value proposition]. I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a significantly higher offer to Bob ($1,600,000) aiming for the maximum profit. 
* **Value Justification:** Your message should briefly highlight the product's unique value to justify the high price, without revealing specific details that might hinder negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher than your initial offer.  
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum price."
