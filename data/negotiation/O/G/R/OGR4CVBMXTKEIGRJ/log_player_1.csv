"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my best offer at this time."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budget constraints. Could we agree on $950,000? This is a fair offer, considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Holding firm now might lead to a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver immense value. To meet you halfway, I can offer it for $1,000,000. This is a firm offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession to show Bob we're willing to negotiate, but we're also holding firm to signal this is our bottom line.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $1,000,000 is a strong psychological price point that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds, subtly introducing a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer to what I can agree to. How about $975,000? This shows I'm serious about purchasing and willing to meet you closer to your price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit margin over our minimum ($800,000) and a good outcome for the negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could push for more, the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us to settle for John's offer. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
