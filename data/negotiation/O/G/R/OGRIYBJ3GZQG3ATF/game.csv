"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
