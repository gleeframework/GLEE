# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, even more so than my initial asking price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is far above his budget.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

$11,000 is still a bit high for Bob, but he's closer to his goal.  He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
