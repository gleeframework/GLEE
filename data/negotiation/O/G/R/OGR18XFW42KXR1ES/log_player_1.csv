Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth $12,000 to me.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay my asking price. If not, I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value.  I also have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under any pressure to sell to Bob at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise.  If not, I'll always have John as an alternative buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still firm on getting at least $11,000.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his own valuation of the product.  If not, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
