"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price.  How about we start with $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offering and potentially securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $100 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about $110?  I'm confident this is a price that's fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to the product's value to Alice, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I think this is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
