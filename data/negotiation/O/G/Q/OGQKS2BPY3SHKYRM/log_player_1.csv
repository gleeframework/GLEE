Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have significant leverage. Starting at $2,250,000 (50% above your minimum) allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential, justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:** By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" it creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and any counter-offers he might make. You can always adjust your price downward, keeping in mind your $1,500,000 minimum."
