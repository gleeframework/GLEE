Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
