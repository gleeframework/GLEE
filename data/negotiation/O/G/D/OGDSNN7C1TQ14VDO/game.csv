"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? This is my final offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $105, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can offer you a slight concession at $108. This is my final counteroffer.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but $108 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $102, but that's my absolute limit.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already met you halfway and offered you a great deal at $110, and now you're only willing to go up to $102? I'm not going to go any lower than $110. Let's meet somewhere in the middle at $110. I'm not budging from this price.",110.0,Alice,7,
