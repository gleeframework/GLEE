Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, though I understand it might represent a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential value."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, selling to Bob at a slightly lower price can still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being substantially higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).  
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message hints that this is a limited opportunity for Bob, potentially motivating him to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob without losing him as a buyer."
