Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting the $125 offer gets you the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
