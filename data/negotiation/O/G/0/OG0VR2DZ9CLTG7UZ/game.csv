"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1100000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
