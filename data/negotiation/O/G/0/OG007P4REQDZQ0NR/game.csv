"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $8,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,400. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen.",8400.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,400 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,300, which is the absolute most I can afford. Let's close this deal at this price.",8300.0,Bob,4,
