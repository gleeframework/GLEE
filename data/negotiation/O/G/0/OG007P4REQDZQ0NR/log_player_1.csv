{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary, but also allows me to potentially maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $8,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,250 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,400. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,400 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,300, which is the absolute most I can afford. Let's close this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has proven to be a tough negotiator. $8,300 is a good deal,  and I don't want to risk losing him entirely and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
