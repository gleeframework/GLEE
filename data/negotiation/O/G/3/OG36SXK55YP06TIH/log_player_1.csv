Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $10,000 exactly might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less inclined to accept. 

By starting high but still within a reasonable range, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal close to her ideal price."
