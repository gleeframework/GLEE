"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can agree.",10000.0,Bob,4,
