{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you can then adjust your price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same as John's offer.  I'll accept it to avoid any further negotiation and secure the sale."
