"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to come down a little from my last offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle from $9,500 to $10,000, and I'll offer $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $9,900. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9900.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500 to $9,900, so how about $9,700?",9700.0,Bob,8,
