"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,150? ",10150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $10,150, so I'll offer you $10,050. Let's see if we can make a deal.",10050.0,Bob,4,
