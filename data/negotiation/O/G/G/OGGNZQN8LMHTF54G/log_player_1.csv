{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer.  It also signals my willingness to deal while keeping the option of selling to John open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell it for such a low price. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,150? "", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $10,150, so I'll offer you $10,050. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's still a decent deal for me.  Since I'm not sure how much longer Bob will be willing to negotiate, accepting his offer is the safest option. It's better than risking a rejection and ending up with nothing or having to sell to John for the same amount."
