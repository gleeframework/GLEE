"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to Alice's valuation. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $112.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at. Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal, as he has several rounds remaining.  Additionally, purchasing from John is still an option, but it's a last resort since it's the most expensive choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $107.50.  That's a good compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's offering a compromise, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway. This demonstrates his commitment to finding a deal while still working towards his goal of saving money.  $107.50 is a reasonable midpoint between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal being reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting closer to my target, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I can offer you the product for $109.25. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109.25 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal at this point.  It's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a decent price.  Additionally, with only five rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures the product within Bob's budget."
