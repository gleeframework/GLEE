"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $10000? It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
