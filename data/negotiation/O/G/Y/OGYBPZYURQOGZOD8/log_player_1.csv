"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and above what the product is worth to Bob ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and makes it clear that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive way, emphasizing the value of the product and the possibility of a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation and willing to discuss the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I'm comfortable selling for.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while remaining within a range Bob might be willing to accept.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting the offer, I can try to get closer to my goal of $150 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($140). This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, implying that $160 is a fair price given its worth.
* **Positive language:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While close to my minimum, there's still some wiggle room for negotiation. I can potentially push for a slightly higher price, closer to my desired $150. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 provides me with a safety net, allowing me to be a bit more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $150?  This would be a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is also the price John is willing to pay. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while still trying to get the best possible price. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to make my offer seem more attractive. 
* **Clear and concise:** I'm using direct language to clearly communicate my offer and leave room for Bob to accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $135 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price. I don't want to keep going down in price if it's not necessary.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, which is a much better outcome than risking a lower price with Bob.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By selling to John, I can secure my minimum acceptable price and avoid the possibility of getting a worse deal with Bob."
