"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500 at this time. ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still more than I can manage.  Let's split the difference - $9,250.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. ",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $9,250 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $10,500. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
