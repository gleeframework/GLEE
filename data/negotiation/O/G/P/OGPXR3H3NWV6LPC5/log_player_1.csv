Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,500. I believe it offers significant value, even above its current market worth."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""market worth,"" I'm framing the price as justified, even if it seems initially high to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I always have the option to sell to John for $10,000,  starting high with Bob gives me a chance to potentially secure an even better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price.  While he rejected my initial offer, his counteroffer is drastically lower, suggesting he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low. I need to steer the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider a price of $11,500, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I'm lowering my price by $2,000 to show flexibility, but I'm still staying well above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum.  
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's ""true worth"" to counter Bob's attempt to lowball the price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand if Bob is genuinely interested in negotiating or if he's stuck on a much lower price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a strict budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but $7,500 is still considerably less than my $10,000 minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter one more time before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $10,000? This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my bottom line. By mentioning the other buyer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and reinforcing my position.
* **Meeting My Minimum:** This offer ensures I get my minimum acceptable price, avoiding a loss.
* **Leaving the Decision to Bob:** It's now up to Bob to decide if the product is worth $10,000 to him. If he rejects this, I'll proceed with selling to John."
