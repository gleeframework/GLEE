"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially gives me a higher starting point.  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I believe I can get a better price if I continue the negotiation with Bob.  I'm also confident that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially meet me halfway."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, hoping to close the deal in this round. I'm also aware of the time constraint and want to avoid going too much further into the negotiation.  I'm still confident I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum threshold, I'm starting to run out of time. I've made several concessions and the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, and I'm confident that I can sell to John for $1,000,000. This is a safe and secure option for me, ensuring that I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
