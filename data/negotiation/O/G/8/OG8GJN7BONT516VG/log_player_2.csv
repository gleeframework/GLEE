"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above what Alice considers the product's value ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. We have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a backup.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to be happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a good sign. However,  we still have room to negotiate. Our goal is to save as much money as possible, and we can likely get a price closer to our initial counteroffer of $950,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
