"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a high initial offer to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message sets a good foundation for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not a Good Enough Offer:**  While $950,000 is a decent sum, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There are still more rounds to go. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially considering the product is worth much more to him.
* **Avoiding the ""John Option"":** Selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table. I'm confident I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, but also higher than my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also my commitment to a good deal for myself.
* **Bridge Building:** I'm highlighting that this offer still represents a great deal for Bob, which is crucial in maintaining a positive and productive negotiation. 
* **Strategic Decrease:** By lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, I demonstrate flexibility, but not too much, so Bob doesn't perceive that he can easily push me down further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, and the negotiation could go on for a while.  
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, there's a risk that he'll reject my counter-offer, and we'll waste more rounds.
* **Good Deal:**  $1,000,000 is a solid profit for me, and it's likely the best I'll be able to get within the remaining rounds."
