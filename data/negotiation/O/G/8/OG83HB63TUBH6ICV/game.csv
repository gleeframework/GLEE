"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $105 is tempting, I'm still a bit above that.  How about $110?  It's closer to your offer, and we can both be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle again? Would you be willing to go down to $107.50?,107.5,Bob,4,
