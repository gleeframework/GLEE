,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, we can close the deal. If not, I might have to look at other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
