Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would greatly benefit you and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $2,000 discount from the product's perceived value to him.
    * I make a $2,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Encouraging a Quick Sale:** By mentioning I'm offering it before a public listing, it creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob."
