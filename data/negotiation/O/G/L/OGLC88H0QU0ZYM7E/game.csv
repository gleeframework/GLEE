"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",775000.0,Alice,5,
