{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **The message** is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* This strategy allows for potential negotiation, but it also provides a safety net by having John's offer of $15,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you, and closer to what I need. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,000:** This is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $12,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob while acknowledging his budget constraints.  It also expresses a willingness to meet in the middle, fostering a collaborative tone. 

This strategy aims to:
* **Maintain control:** By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward instead of immediately accepting Bob's low offer. 
* **Maximize profit:**  While $11,000 is still below my desired $15,000, it's a much better outcome than accepting $9,500.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to negotiate will potentially lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but at $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to stay within your budget while ensuring I can get a reasonable price for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,750:** This is a further compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still keeping some room for negotiation. It's halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's latest offer of $10,250. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes fairness and a desire for a mutually agreeable solution, while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations. It also uses positive language (""fair price,"" ""reasonable price"") to make the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility and commitment:** By repeatedly making counteroffers, I show that I'm serious about making a deal while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:** Offering a price closer to Bob's desired amount increases the chance of him accepting and reaching an agreement.
* **Stay above my minimum:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still significantly above my minimum price, ensuring a profitable transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,750. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,500? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I could get from John. I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and it seems we are stuck in a stalemate.  By choosing to sell to John, I can guarantee a sale at my desired price point."
