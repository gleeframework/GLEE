Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Even though John is offering the product for $1,500,000, it's worth trying to get a better deal with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to his goal, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for both of them to compromise."
