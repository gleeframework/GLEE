"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to someone with your needs. To kick off our negotiation, I'm offering it to you at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and hopefully get a better price.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $950,000. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand you see the value in this product. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my initial target, I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I can still try to push for a lower price and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. I've got 7 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $875,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's time to close the deal and secure the product.  It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer, and I don't want to risk losing the product to another buyer."
