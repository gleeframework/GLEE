"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your operations. I'm asking for $950,000, which is a fair price considering its potential value to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000,  which still allows for a substantial profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $875,000. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to be at least at $890,000 to make this deal work. It's a significant investment for you, and I believe this price reflects the product's potential value.",890000.0,Alice,5,
