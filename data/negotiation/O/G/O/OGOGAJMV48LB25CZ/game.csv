"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That's still a great price for you considering the value of this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid further back and forth.",10000.0,Bob,4,
