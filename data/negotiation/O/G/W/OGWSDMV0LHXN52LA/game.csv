"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique nature of the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $6,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my best offer for now. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
