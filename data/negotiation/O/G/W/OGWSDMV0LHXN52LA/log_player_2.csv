Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $6,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my best offer for now. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John to secure the best deal."
