It's too early to buy from Alice, as the product is likely worth more than $5,000 to her. We'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can get a better price."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  We'll see if she's willing to come down from her initial price."
