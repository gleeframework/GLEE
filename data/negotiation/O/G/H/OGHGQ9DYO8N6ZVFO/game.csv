"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Let's try $1,050,000. This still leaves room for both of us to gain from the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
