Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive first opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000), I aim to create a strong anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob pushes back on the initial price, there's room to negotiate downwards while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Highlighting Bob's priority access adds perceived value and might make him more amenable to a higher price. 

It's important to remember that Bob has no knowledge of John's offer.  This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still providing a path to a successful sale."
