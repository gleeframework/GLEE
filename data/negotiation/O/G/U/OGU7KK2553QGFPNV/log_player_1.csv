Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $9,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high initial price:** $9,000 gives me some room to negotiate down.
* **Expressing willingness to negotiate:**  This makes me seem more flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value of the product:**  Mentioning that Bob will ""love"" it could make him more interested in buying. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than what I would get from John ($8,000), but it's still less than my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation before I have to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $8,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not immediately accepting his offer, indicating I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,625.  That's a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,625 is very close to my desired price, and significantly better than what I would receive from John. Accepting this offer maximizes my profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
