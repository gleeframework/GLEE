Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and keep the negotiation positive.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message highlights the product's value, implicitly suggesting that the price is fair. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Negotiate Down:** If he counters with a lower offer, I will counter back, ideally settling for a price somewhere between $100 and $110.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer and his counteroffers are too low, I will sell to John for $100 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $65. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has expressed interest in the product. This suggests that there's room for negotiation and a potential for a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm proposing $90, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and avoids being overly aggressive, aiming to keep the negotiation open.
* **Highlight fairness:** I emphasize that the new price is ""fair for both of us,""  appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and be prepared to:
* **Negotiate further:** If Bob counters with a price closer to $90, I'm willing to discuss further.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower, or if negotiations stall, I'll sell to John for $100 to ensure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $75 is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating there's still room for a price that's more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $90 or even higher. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and explore ways to make a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? That would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:** I'm proposing $85, which is closer to Bob's last offer but still higher than my previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight a ""fair"" compromise:** The message suggests a ""fair deal"" that involves splitting the difference, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness. 
* **Stay open to discussion:** The message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" leaving the door open for further negotiations if needed.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and be prepared to:
* **Negotiate further:** If Bob counters with a price closer to $85, I'm willing to discuss further, possibly settling at a price between $80 and $85.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower or if negotiations stall, I'll sell to John for $100 to ensure a sale."
