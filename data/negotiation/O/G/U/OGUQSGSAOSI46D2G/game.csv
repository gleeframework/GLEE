"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. This would be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product at a price significantly lower than its actual value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
