"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing it's above Bob's valuation. This will give me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profit close to my minimum of $15,000.  I'm also setting a positive tone to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable but still allows me to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $14,000. This is still above Bob's valuation but closer to my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not giving away the product for a huge loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about $12,000? I'm very interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going below $13,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $13,000 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $12,500? I'm sure we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise a bit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer but still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need to see a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $12,500 is still a little too low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $13,250.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm offering $13,250, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the need to close the deal, hoping to create a sense of urgency for Bob."
