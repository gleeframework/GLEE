"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,500,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
