"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob has a strong incentive to accept, as the product is worth $15,000 to him.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also still a good price for me, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,750. This is a further compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal. At this point, we are close to his value of $15,000 and my minimum of $12,000. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to hold out for a bit more,  Bob's offer of $13,250 is pretty close to my minimum and we are already at Round 6. There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to him rejecting and I might end up with a lower price or even lose the deal entirely.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the deal."
