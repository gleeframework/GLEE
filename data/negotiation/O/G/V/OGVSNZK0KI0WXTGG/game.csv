,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $11,500? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
