"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000.  This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go lower than $14,000, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is still a bit higher than you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $14,000. I'm willing to make one last offer to you. If you're willing to meet me at $14,000, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
