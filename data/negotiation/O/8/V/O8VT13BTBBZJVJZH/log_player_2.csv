Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $13,500, it's still over my budget of $10,000. I'm not willing to go above my limit, but there are still a couple of rounds left, and I'm hoping to push for a better deal. I'm also considering the option of buying from John, so I'm keeping my options open."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is still a bit higher than you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $14,000. I'm willing to make one last offer to you. If you're willing to meet me at $14,000, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeatedly insisted on $14,000, which is well above my budget.  I've made multiple counteroffers, but she's unwilling to budge.  With only one round remaining, the chances of a successful negotiation are slim.  It's better to secure the product at John's price of $10,000, which is within my budget, rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
