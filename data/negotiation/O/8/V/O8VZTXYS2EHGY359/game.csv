"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, so my starting price is $1,450,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.  Let's talk!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,450,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's value.  How about $1,400,000?  This would allow us both to gain a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer at $1,400,000. Given my financial constraints, I cannot exceed $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you, allowing us to finalize the transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing a final offer of $1,375,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I'm hoping you'll accept this offer and we can finalize the deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
