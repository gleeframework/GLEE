"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $750000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also leaving room for both of us to make a profit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $820000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $820000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident that we can close this deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
