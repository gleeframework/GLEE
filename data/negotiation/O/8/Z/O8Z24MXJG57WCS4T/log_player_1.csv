Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly implies the product is worth the high price without explicitly stating it's worth more to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""I believe"" and ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially negotiate the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a deal to be made."
