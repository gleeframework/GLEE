"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $128.75.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",128.75,Bob,4,
