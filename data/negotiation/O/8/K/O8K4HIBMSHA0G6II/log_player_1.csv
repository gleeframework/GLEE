Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions the offer as a great deal, encouraging Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $128.75.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $128.75 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further.  It's better for me to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
