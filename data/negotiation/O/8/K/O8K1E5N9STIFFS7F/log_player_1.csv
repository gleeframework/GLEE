I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll gauge Bob's response and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm happy with $1,200,000, I think there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a decent compromise. It's more than what John is offering and not too far from my desired price. It's time to close the deal."
