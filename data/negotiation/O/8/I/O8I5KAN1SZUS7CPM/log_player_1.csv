Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, considering my budget and its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I can either try to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000. Since I have 10 rounds, I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. How about $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's my absolute limit. I think it's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'd prefer to keep negotiating. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,500 is still a bit below my expectations. Let's aim for $15,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to work within my budget here. I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desired price. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to John."
