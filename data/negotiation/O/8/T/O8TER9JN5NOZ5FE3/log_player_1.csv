Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice needs to make at least $1,000,000 (her value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can lead to a deal.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting high allows Alice to potentially capture more of the value difference. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Even if Bob counters, Alice has room to come down slightly and still make a great deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Knowing its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as an investment.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 allows Alice to potentially gain $150,000 more than her fallback offer from John.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially around $1,100,000, which is still very favorable for Alice. 

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't offer a price within the ZOPA. John's offer provides a strong safety net."
