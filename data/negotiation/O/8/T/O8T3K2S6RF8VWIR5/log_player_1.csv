Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at my desired price point ($150) to maximize potential earnings.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  While I'm starting high, I'm not closing the door on negotiation. The message implies I'm open to discussing the price.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Prepared to walk away:** I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage during negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $80, his offer is still below my minimum price of $150. 
* **I have a better option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not obligated to accept Bob's lower offer.
* **Leverage for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, but still higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer close to my desired price:** I'm offering a price closer to my minimum of $150, but still leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and framing the offer as a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not yet accepting Bob's offer, but showing willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to budge and how close I can get to my desired price.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:**  My fallback option with John gives me the confidence to negotiate firmly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $150. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  I have a buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price than what I can get from John.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the best deal:**  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** I'm choosing to maximize my profit and minimize the risk of a lower offer."
