"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to the $900,000 mark."

Bob has two good options here:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This is a good deal for Bob, as he is paying only $25,000 more than what the product is worth to him.
* **Buy from John:** This is the guaranteed price, but Bob is saving $25,000 by accepting Alice's offer.

Since Bob's goal is to save money, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
