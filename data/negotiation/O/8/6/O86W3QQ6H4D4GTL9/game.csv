"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a million dollars to you for a reasonable price. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This seems fair, given the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would still leave you with a profit and allows me to acquire the product at a price that's closer to its value to me.  Let's try to reach a middle ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Considering the value this product holds for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're open to this.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
