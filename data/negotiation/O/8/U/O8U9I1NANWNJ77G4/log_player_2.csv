"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice and she's offering it for $1,100,000. This means there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to my business.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,100,000.  Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This offers you a significant profit and allows me to acquire the item within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $900,000. As the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product, and it's closer to my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is still above my target of $800,000. However, it's closer to my budget and shows a willingness to compromise. There's still room to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This would give you a solid profit, and it's the highest I can go at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $1,025,000, which is closer to my target but still above my comfort zone.  It seems she's unwilling to drop below $1,000,000. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
