"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be a huge asset to your business.  I've priced it competitively at $1,200,000, reflecting its value and potential.  Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, reflecting a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair midpoint between our current positions.  This offer reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  $1,000,000 is closer, but still leaves a small gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
