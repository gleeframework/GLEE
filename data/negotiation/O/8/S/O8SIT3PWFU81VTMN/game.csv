"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand you think $105 is a fair price, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $115? This is my final offer, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,122.0
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $122. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",122.0,Alice,5,,
