"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 simply doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  Let's compromise:  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still offers you a substantial profit margin, and I believe it's fair considering the product's potential.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However,  $850,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a compromise for both of us. This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I get a fair return. Let's make this deal work.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close, but $825,000 just isn't quite there yet. Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $860,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value.  Let's make this happen.",860000.0,Alice,7,
