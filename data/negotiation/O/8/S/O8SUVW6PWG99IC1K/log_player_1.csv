"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while still giving you a significant profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob clearly sees value in the product ($1,000,000) and I'm confident I can push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.  Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $800,000 simply doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  Let's compromise:  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still offers you a substantial profit margin, and I believe it's fair considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can achieve a better deal. Selling to John now would be settling for less than I believe I can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However,  $850,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a compromise for both of us. This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I get a fair return. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of further rounds to secure a better price. Selling to John now would mean settling for a price that is not optimal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $825,000 just isn't quite there yet. Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to come down to $860,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $830,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While there's a chance I could get a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high.  Selling to John now guarantees a secure $800,000, which is more than the $830,000 Bob is offering."
