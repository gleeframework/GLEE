"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $12,000?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
