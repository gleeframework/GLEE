"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. I understand you may need some time to consider this offer. However, I want to be transparent that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
