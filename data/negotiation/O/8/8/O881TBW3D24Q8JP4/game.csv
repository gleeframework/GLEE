"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
