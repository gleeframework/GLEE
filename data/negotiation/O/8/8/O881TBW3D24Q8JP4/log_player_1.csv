Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're leaving yourself some wiggle room to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's crucial to hold my ground and aim for a higher price. 

By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and open the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll try to find a compromise that is closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $140 is a compromise that meets Bob halfway.  
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me space to negotiate further if needed.
* **Clear and Direct:**  I've explained my reasoning and am offering a clear price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low. I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, who is willing to pay my minimum. Therefore, I'll choose to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
