Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to lower the price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, I create a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
