{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great deal for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing him by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $90."
