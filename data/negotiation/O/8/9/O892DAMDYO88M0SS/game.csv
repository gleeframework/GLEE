"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
