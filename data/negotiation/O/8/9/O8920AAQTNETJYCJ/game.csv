"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial price is attractive, I'm looking to pay closer to what it's worth to me. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and a great starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I think this is a reasonable starting point.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
