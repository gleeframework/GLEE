"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?  It's a fair offer that considers both our positions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $800,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
