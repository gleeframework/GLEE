Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high price. By framing it as a ""fair offer,"" I aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable deal even though it's above his initial valuation. 
 
This strategy aims to balance the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a higher price than my guaranteed sale to John."
