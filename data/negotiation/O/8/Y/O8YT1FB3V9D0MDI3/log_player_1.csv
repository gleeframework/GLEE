``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, while still securing a good profit for me. It also leaves room for me to lower the price if needed, while still maintaining a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't afford to drop the price that significantly. I'll counter with a higher price, but if he refuses to budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I've already made several concessions, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much further.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a much higher price."
