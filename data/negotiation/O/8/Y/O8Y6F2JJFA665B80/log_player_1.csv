Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Value:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John.

By offering $1,400,000, I'm:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Bob has incentive to counteroffer as he sees value in the product.
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  My offer is well above my minimum, so I'm not risking a significant loss if Bob rejects.

This strategy balances the desire for a high price with the need to keep the negotiation open and avoid losing the potential sale to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **My Minimum:**  I am still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000.

**Why Reject:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is showing interest, his counteroffer is too low. There is still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can achieve a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **No Immediate Loss:**  Rejecting his offer doesn't lead to an immediate loss. I can still secure John's offer if negotiations fail.

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Offer:** My previous offer was $1,400,000, and Bob countered with $1,200,000. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving towards Bob's offer by $100,000, showing flexibility while still staying above his offer.
* **Balancing Profit and Negotiation:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep negotiations ongoing. 

**Why $1,300,000?**

* **Compromise:**  This price represents a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a significant profit for me, well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The offer is attractive enough to encourage Bob to potentially accept or counter with a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John.

**Why Accept:**

* **Significant Profit:** While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a significant profit for me and significantly better than John's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** The negotiation process is becoming longer, and there's no guarantee that further rounds will lead to a significantly higher price.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting this offer reduces the risk of further negotiation breakdowns, potentially leading to a lower price or losing the sale to Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. While it's not the highest possible price, it's a good outcome considering the available options."
