"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair price reflecting the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  While I appreciate your latest offer, we're still quite a bit apart.  To move towards a mutually agreeable deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects my flexibility while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
