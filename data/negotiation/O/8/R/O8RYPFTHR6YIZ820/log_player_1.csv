{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. You can justify it by highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob.  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price a bit more, but remember, you have the safety net of John who is willing to pay your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below your minimum value of $12,000 and leaves you with a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value. You can use John's willingness to pay $12,000 as leverage in your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,500 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $9,500. This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to accept."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,200. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is still below your desired price, but it's much closer to your minimum value of $12,000.  This is a good compromise.  It's more profitable than selling to John and only slightly less than your counteroffer, so it's reasonable to accept."
