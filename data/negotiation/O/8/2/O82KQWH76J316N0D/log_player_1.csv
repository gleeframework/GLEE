{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This price reflects its high value and potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's above your minimum price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.  

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation going with Bob. He has a higher valuation, so there's more potential to earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. By rejecting his offer, I can  make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our valuations. There's still potential to get a higher price from Bob than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I need to stay closer to my valuation for this product. Let's try $875,000. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and gives you a significant discount compared to your initial valuation.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to gain something from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I respect your valuation and the effort to find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $840,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our interests. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $840,000 is just above my minimum price of $800,000 and represents a good compromise.  It's likely that further negotiation will be challenging, and I risk losing a sale entirely.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the deal."
