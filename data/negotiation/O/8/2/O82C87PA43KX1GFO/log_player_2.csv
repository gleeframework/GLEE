**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate one more time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. If not, I'll buy from John."

While Alice has come down significantly, her final offer of $1,012,500 is still above my budget.  I'm not willing to go any higher, so it's better to buy the product from John for $800,000 and save myself some money."
