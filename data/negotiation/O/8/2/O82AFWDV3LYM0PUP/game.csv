"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective.  While $800,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we consider a price of $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial returns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but we're still quite far apart.  To be honest, anything much over $1,000,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  How about $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it will bring.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down more for this to make sense for me.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I could go to John right now and get it for that price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
