"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and Alice is offering it for the same price, it makes sense to accept the offer. Buying from John would cost the same, so there's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer."
