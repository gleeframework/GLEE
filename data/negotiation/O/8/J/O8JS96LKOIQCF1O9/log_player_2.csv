"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm starting the price at $130. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's starting price and my maximum budget.  A counteroffer of $105 gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below $150.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating my price target. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves space for a counter-counteroffer from Alice, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $117?  This is a great product, and I think it will be worth it for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to my price, $117 is still significantly above her value of $100. There's room for her to come down further.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** Rejecting this offer signals I'm serious about a lower price and keeps the negotiation moving.  
* **Alternative Exists:** I'm comfortable rejecting this offer because I have the backup option of buying from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Alice's price but holding firm below $115. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Simple and Clear:** The message proposes a specific price point (""meet in the middle"") to make it easy for Alice to evaluate.
* **Time Consideration:**  As we progress through the rounds, offering smaller increments can help speed up the negotiation process."
