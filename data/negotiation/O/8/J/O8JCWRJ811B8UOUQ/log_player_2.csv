It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $120 is still more than the product is worth to you, and there's a chance you can get a better price."

I'm offering $105, which is still a decent profit for Alice, and closer to my desired price."

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying below what I'm willing to pay John.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm not going to overpay."

Alice is clearly not going to budge much lower.  While I'd prefer to get the product for less, I'm happy to pay John $150 to avoid further negotiation.  I'm confident I can find a better deal next time."
