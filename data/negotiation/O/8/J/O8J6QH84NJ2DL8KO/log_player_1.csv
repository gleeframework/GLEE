Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a price significantly above your fallback option (John at $80).
* **Not Being Greedy:** While you could start higher, aiming for the middle ground increases the likelihood of Bob accepting without further negotiation."
