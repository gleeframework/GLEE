Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still too low for me, especially since I know it's worth much more to him. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,350,000,  $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's still a significant profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard."
