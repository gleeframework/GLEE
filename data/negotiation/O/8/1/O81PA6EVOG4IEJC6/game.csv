"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and the potential for further negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price closer to your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $975000.",975000.0,Alice,5,
