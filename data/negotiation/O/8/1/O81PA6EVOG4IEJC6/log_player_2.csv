It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price closer to your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000.

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You can try to counteroffer again or buy from John for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $975000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

While $975,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point and you risk going back and forth with Alice for a while longer.  It's best to buy from John at this point and secure the product for a price you're comfortable with."
