"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```
Although Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I can sell to John immediately for the same amount. There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in future rounds, so I'll take the certain deal with John.
