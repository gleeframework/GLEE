"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the agreement at this price.",8750.0,Alice,3,
