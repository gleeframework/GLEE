This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my valuation of $1,500,000 while still being attractive to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my valuation than his initial offer, I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and  would still leave you with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see if this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering prices below my minimum acceptable value. I've already made concessions, and further negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a satisfactory price for me.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
