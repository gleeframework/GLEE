"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've offered before. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $760,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $760,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
