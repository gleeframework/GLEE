"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is significantly below the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $12000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $9500 is still quite a bit below my minimum price. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $11000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $10500. I hope this proposal will be agreeable to you.",10500.0,Bob,6,
