"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'd like to try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $1,225,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's true value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could get from John. Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my budget and allows us to both make a reasonable deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we try $1,200,000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a good compromise that reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly the same price as what John is offering.  Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, there's no advantage to continuing negotiations with Alice.  He can get the product for the same price from John, avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
