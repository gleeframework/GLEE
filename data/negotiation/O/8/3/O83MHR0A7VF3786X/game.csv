"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'd like to try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $1,225,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's true value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my budget and allows us to both make a reasonable deal.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we try $1,200,000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a good compromise that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
