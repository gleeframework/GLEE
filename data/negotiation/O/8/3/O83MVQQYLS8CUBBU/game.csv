"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very competitive price point.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down significantly, to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  how about we settle on $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Let's try to find a middle ground - how about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be fair to the product's value. $750,000 is too low.  I'm willing to consider $925,000 â€“ it's my final offer. It represents a significant reduction and a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset.",925000.0,Alice,5,
