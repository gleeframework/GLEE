Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down significantly, to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
