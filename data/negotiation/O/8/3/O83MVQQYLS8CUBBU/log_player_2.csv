"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very competitive price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down significantly, to $600,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway -  how about we settle on $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Let's try to find a middle ground - how about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be fair to the product's value. $750,000 is too low.  I'm willing to consider $925,000 â€“ it's my final offer. It represents a significant reduction and a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm on a price well above your maximum budget.  While she might come down slightly in future rounds, it's unlikely she'll drop to a price that makes sense for you.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which saves you money and avoids further negotiation risk."
