"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $120 from John.  Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's, but Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above Bob's $85 counteroffer.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? "", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $88.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, but it's still above Bob's preferred price.  Bob could continue to negotiate, but it's getting close to the price he's willing to pay from John.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will just take more time and may not result in a significantly better price. 

Therefore, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $120.  This ensures he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, and it saves him the time and effort of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
