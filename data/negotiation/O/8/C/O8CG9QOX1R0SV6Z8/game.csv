"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
