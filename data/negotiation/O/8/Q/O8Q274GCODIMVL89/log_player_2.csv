"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product could be useful, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a better deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** My goal is to pay significantly less than John's $15,000 offer.  $11,000 feels like a good starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Negotiating:**  Alice moving from $14,000 to $12,500 indicates she's willing to negotiate. There's still room to work towards a better price.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** $12,500 is closer to an acceptable range, but it's still important to try and get a better deal than John's $15,000 offer. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By rejecting and countering again, I keep the negotiation active and signal I'm serious about getting a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,750? I think that's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $11,000 to $11,750 to show Alice I'm willing to move towards her price. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than John's $15,000 offer while still being potentially acceptable to Alice. 
* **Framing as a Compromise:** By presenting this offer as a ""reasonable compromise,"" I'm hoping to encourage Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $12,100.  This offer reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is moving down in price, the increments are getting smaller. We're still a significant amount away from my target price.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're now halfway through the rounds. Continuing to reject and counter at this pace might not leave enough time to reach a deal significantly better than John's offer.
* **Applying Pressure:**  Rejecting this offer signals to Alice that I'm serious about a lower price and willing to walk away if necessary.  This might encourage her to make a more substantial move in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,900, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price considering you'd be saving on time and effort finding another buyer."",
""product_price"": 11900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer presents a compromise while establishing a firm limit. 
* **Highlighting Benefits for Alice:** By mentioning the benefits to Alice (time saved, guaranteed sale), I'm increasing the perceived value of my offer.
* **Limited Time:**  With only a few rounds remaining, setting a firm ""final offer"" adds pressure for Alice to make a decision. This can encourage her to accept a price closer to my target.
* **Backup Plan:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to accept John's offer of $15,000 in the next round or two.  This ensures I don't miss out on the product entirely."
