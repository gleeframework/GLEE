"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiations and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still too high. How about we split the difference and I pay $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  To be fair to us both, I could let it go for $14,000 and no lower. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:** 

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still outside of Bob's comfortable range. He has 5 rounds left but is getting closer to his limit.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her walking away completely or Bob running out of rounds and being forced to accept a higher price than he wants."
