,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still too high. How about we split the difference and I pay $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  To be fair to us both, I could let it go for $14,000 and no lower. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
