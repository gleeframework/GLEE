Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit for both parties.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still engaging Bob in a negotiation. I'm willing to walk away with John's offer of $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to that number through negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $975,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, emphasizing the benefit for both parties.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting him halfway,  showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while staying within a range that Bob might consider acceptable.  I'm hopeful that this compromise will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $925,000. I really think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $925,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still my best option at this point, as I'm not sure if further negotiations with Bob will lead to a more favorable outcome. However, I am still open to further negotiation, hoping to see if I can get Bob to offer a price closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $925,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a great price for the product, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $975,000 and Bob's offer of $925,000. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a clear reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the need to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Finality:** While remaining open to negotiation, I'm signaling that this is a serious offer.

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while still maintaining a sense of compromise. I'm hoping that this offer will convince Bob to accept, as it's a solid deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm starting to feel that further rounds with Bob are unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum requirements.  At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most financially beneficial option, securing a price that meets my needs and ensuring a successful transaction."
