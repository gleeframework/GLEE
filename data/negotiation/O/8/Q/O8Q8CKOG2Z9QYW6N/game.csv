"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product. However,  $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle at $1750000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can reach a deal closer to $1500000. How about $1600000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to still get a fair price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $1650000. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
