"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to make this purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $975,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
