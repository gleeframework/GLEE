"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $85, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $95. This is my final offer, and I'd really like to make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",100.0,Alice,5,
