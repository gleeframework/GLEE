Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than his perceived value increases the chances he'll accept immediately.

This strategy balances my desire for maximum profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to settle for $12,000 from John."
