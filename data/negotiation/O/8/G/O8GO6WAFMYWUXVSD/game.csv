"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
