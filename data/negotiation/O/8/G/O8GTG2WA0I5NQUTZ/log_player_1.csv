Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you.  I'm asking for $1,800,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,800,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor point. This might make Bob perceive a subsequent lower offer as more reasonable.
* **Sense of Scarcity and Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of scarcity and competition.  This could push Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price than he initially intended. 
* **Fallback Option:**  It's important to remember that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This knowledge allows you to confidently aim high with Bob, knowing you have a safety net.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes some level of negotiation is possible and that Bob might be influenced by scarcity tactics.  Adjusting the initial offer based on any knowledge of Bob's personality or negotiation style could be beneficial.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk that Bob might be completely turned off by the high initial offer and walk away. Assessing your own risk tolerance is key."
