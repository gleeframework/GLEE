Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, and I'm hoping I can get Bob to go a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  To be fair, I can come down to $11,500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to risk another round with Bob to see if I can push him a little further. If I can't get a better offer, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle at $11,125?  This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there at $11125.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10937.50?  This seems like a fair and reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,937.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the offers are still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob, especially since I don't know how much further he's willing to go. To avoid risking a final deal at a price lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
