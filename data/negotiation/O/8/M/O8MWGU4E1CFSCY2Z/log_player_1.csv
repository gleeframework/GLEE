Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by anchoring the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if vague, can make the offer seem more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** I am prepared to negotiate down if Bob rejects this initial offer. My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to avoid being too greedy and losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a decent amount above my minimum. By rejecting and countering, I aim to secure a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a very competitive price for this quality."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Clear Target:**  By suggesting $100, I'm setting a clear target for Bob and hopefully encouraging him to accept."
