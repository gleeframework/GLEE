Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,500 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), making it a potentially attractive deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob accepts, or lower it if you need to. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a smooth negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $14,500.  Since you have the option to sell to John for $12,000, it's not worth accepting Bob's offer right now.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price. 
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** By rejecting his initial counteroffer, you'll see if he's truly interested in negotiating or simply trying to get the lowest price.

You have a strong position here, as you're not pressured to accept Bob's offer.  You can use this to your advantage in the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm open to negotiating, $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This approach signals a willingness to compromise and move towards a mutually beneficial deal.  
* **Emphasizing value for Bob:**  The message reiterates that $13,500 is still a good price for him, considering the product's value to him.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While you're willing to lower your price, you're not giving away too much, ensuring you still get a decent profit. 

By offering $13,500, you're showing flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiation position.  This counteroffer should hopefully encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $12,000 is exactly what you would get from John.  While you would prefer to get a higher price, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks prolonging the process and potentially losing the deal entirely. 

Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's more strategic to accept his offer and ensure a quick and certain sale. This minimizes the risk of further negotiations falling through."
