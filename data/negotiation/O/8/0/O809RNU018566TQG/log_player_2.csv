"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $1,999,999. I believe it holds immense value, even exceeding your initial assessment.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John for the best price."
