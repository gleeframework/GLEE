Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response.**  It emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect, which can make Bob more inclined to accept or counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Encourage engagement:** A friendly message increases the chances of Bob responding.
* **Keep John as a backup:** You can always switch to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and doesn't reflect the product's true value. 
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, giving Bob another chance to consider a more mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  If negotiations with Bob continue to be unsuccessful, I have the backup option of selling to John for a much higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating leverage and keep the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise.**  It's higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **The message is still friendly and emphasizes fairness.**  It focuses on finding a price that works for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John.** This counteroffer keeps the door open for further negotiation but also allows me to switch to John if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,250 is still too low.** It's closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Rejecting keeps the negotiating process open.**  I can counteroffer again, potentially reaching a price closer to my target while still keeping John as a backup option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $11,250 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. That's a good price for a great product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a small step.**  It's a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my target.
* **The message emphasizes value and mutual benefit.**  It highlights the product's quality and focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to consider accepting or making a final counteroffer.
* **Keeps the option to sell to John open.** If this counteroffer is rejected, I can switch to selling to John for a higher price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm gradually moving towards a price closer to my desired value.
* **Encourage final acceptance:**  A small compromise might convince Bob to accept, as it's likely near his maximum price.
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation."
