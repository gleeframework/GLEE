"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd love to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob.  While $1,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $925,000? This offer reflects a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $875,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
