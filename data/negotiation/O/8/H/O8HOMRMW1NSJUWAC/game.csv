"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",12500.0,Bob,4,
