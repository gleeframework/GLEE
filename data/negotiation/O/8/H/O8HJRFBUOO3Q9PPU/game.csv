"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. I believe it's worth more than what others are asking, but let's discuss a fair price. My initial offer is $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise. How about I bring the price down to $95? This still allows us to value the product appropriately while making it more accessible for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $85. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering our past discussions, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $90 for the product? This still gives us room to value the product appropriately while making it more appealing to you.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can reach a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $87.50. This is a fair price that shows a commitment from both of us to reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try $88.50. This is a slight compromise from my last offer, aiming for a fair valuation of the product while also being mindful of your budget.",88.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate the slight drop, $88.50 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  This is a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",87.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Considering our ongoing discussion, I propose $88. This is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while being more accommodating to your budget. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",88.0,Alice,9,
