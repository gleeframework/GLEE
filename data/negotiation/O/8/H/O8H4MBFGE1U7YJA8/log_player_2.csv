Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems pretty firm on a price well above our budget. Her latest offer of $16,000 is a step backward and suggests she might not be willing to budge much further.  We have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000, which saves us a significant amount of money. It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
