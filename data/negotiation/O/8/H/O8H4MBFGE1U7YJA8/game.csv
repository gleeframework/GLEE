"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,000.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about $13,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
