"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe you'll find this offer appealing. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
