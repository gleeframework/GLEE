Bob's offer is my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but still aim for a profit above my minimum. I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to keep the price high enough to make the deal worthwhile for me."
