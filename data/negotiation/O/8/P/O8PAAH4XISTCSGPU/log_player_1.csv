Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John offers a safety net of $1,200,000.  The goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. We need to offer a price that's attractive to him but leaves room for profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  It signals the product's high value while still being potentially appealing to Bob if he's highly interested. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** This initial offer is a starting point. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a backup, exploring if other potential buyers exist might be beneficial in maximizing profit further."
