"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price slightly but staying above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a price closer to my desired value."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering I'm already halfway through the negotiations and John's offer is lower.  I'm happy to secure a sale and get a decent profit."
