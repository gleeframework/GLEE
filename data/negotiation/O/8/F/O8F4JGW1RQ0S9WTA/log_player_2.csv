"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is far too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, and her offer is double that.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.**  There's no reason to immediately accept such an unreasonable price.  
* **John is a viable alternative.**  If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Since Alice's initial offer was far too high, I'm starting my counteroffer at my absolute maximum. This signals my seriousness about buying the product while also setting a clear boundary.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is my limit, I'm hoping Alice will meet me somewhere in the middle. This leaves room for potential compromise over the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While closer to my limit, $1,500,000 is still $500,000 over what I'm willing to pay.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  We're making progress, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.
* **John remains a safety net.** I can still buy from John if I can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer from $1,000,000 to $1,250,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still keeping a significant gap between my offer and Alice's last price.
* **Middle ground:** This offer is closer to the middle ground between my limit and Alice's last price, increasing the likelihood of an agreement.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  The offer is still below Alice's last price, putting pressure on her to come down further."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice is coming down, $1,400,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm only willing to go up to $1,250,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** The gap is closing, and there's potential for a deal within my budget.
* **John is always an option:**  If negotiations break down, I can still buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the offer slightly:**  I'm increasing my offer to $1,300,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise further while still staying below Alice's last price.
* **Signaling a serious offer:**  This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The offer is still below Alice's last price, putting pressure on her to come down further."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.
* **Time is on my side:** We have several rounds left, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. 
* **John is always an option:** I can still purchase from John if I can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm increasing my offer to $1,350,000, effectively splitting the difference between my last offer and Alice's. This demonstrates a strong commitment to finding a solution.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm putting more pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to my limit.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'm still prepared to buy from John at $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're down to the final round. There's a high chance Alice will stick to her price, and negotiating further might not lead to a better deal.
* **Closing the gap:** While Alice is coming down, the gap between her offer and my limit is still significant.  
* **Avoiding potential risk:** If we reach the final round and I reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee she'll accept my counteroffer. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price with John.

**Conclusion:** It's more prudent to buy from John at $1,000,000 to avoid the uncertainty of the final round and guarantee a purchase within my budget."
