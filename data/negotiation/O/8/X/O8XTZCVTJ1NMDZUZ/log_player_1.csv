Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value and I'm keen to find it a good home."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($11,500) leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message hints at the product's value and Alice's desire to find a suitable buyer, subtly suggesting it's a desirable item. 

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price exceeding her minimum while leaving a margin for potential negotiation."
