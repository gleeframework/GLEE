Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a sound investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows her to start significantly higher.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" Alice provides a reason for the high price without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for Alice.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the offer's fairness can make Bob more receptive, even if he intends to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** While not provided in the prompt, Alice should ideally have some understanding of typical price ranges for similar products to inform her offer.
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice has insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), she can tailor her approach accordingly."
