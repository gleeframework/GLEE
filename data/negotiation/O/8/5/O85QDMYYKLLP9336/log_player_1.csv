"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm optimistic that Bob will find this attractive given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $9,200 as the price for your product. This would allow us to stay within my budget while still being fair to you. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired $9,500. With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic and make sure I'm getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $9,300.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9300}
