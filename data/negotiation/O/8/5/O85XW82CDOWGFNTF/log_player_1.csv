"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000), you set a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's value and demand helps justify the high initial price, even if slightly exaggerated.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, showing you're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $18,000 reflects the true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000?  This offer stands as a testament to my eagerness to work with you."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession by coming down $2,000. This shows flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still above both your minimum and Bob's offer, aiming for a price that benefits both parties.
* **Positive Language:** The language emphasizes a collaborative approach and reinforces the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of the budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Bottom Line:** Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting this offer signals that while you appreciate his efforts, you're still looking for a slightly higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that John's offer is your safety net, ensuring you won't have to settle for less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,750? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 14750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're explicitly stating this is your final offer, adding weight to the negotiation.
* **Slight Concession:** You're making another small concession, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This tactic often feels fair to both parties, potentially leading to a quicker agreement. 
* **Above the Minimum:** The offer is still comfortably above your $12,000 minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value.

**Important Note:** This offer carries some risk. Bob might be unwilling to go above $13,500. If he rejects this offer, you'll need to decide whether to accept his previous offer, continue negotiating with limited rounds remaining, or take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $14,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** While not ideal, $13,000 is still a $1,000 profit over your minimum and a reasonable outcome considering Bob's persistent resistance to go higher.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, the odds of significantly increasing Bob's offer diminish. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether, potentially forcing you to settle for John's $12,000 offer. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit."
