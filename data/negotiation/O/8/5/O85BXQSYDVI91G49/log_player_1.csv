Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'm thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price for both of us. It's the price you value the product at, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob has effectively met our lowest acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success, and we risk him lowering his offer. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk."
