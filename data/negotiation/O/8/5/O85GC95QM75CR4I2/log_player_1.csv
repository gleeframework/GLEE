{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. The message is friendly and highlights the product's potential value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for this product. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price. It's worth exploring if you can reach a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to recoup some of my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I must stick to my budget. I am still only able to consider offers up to $10000. Would it be possible to reach a mutual agreement within this price range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $10,000 offer.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees your minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
