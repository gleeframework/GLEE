Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of scarcity and desirability.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims high, leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can gradually lower the price, knowing my absolute minimum is already met by John's offer."
