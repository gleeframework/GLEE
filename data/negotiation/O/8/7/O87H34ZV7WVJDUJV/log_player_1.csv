Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting and sets a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 110}
