"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still too high for Bob. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer of $120. It's still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $150.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saving him $40 compared to buying from John."
