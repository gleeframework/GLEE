# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range. While it's tempting to accept,  it's better to try and negotiate a lower price. You have room to maneuver before reaching your upper limit of $1,500,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,150,000 is still above my target price. There's still room for negotiation before I have to consider buying from John.  I'll try to make a counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,120,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is still higher than my target, but it's getting close. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that she will come down further. Considering John's price of $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money. I can live with a slightly higher price to secure the product."
