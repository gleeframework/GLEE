"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $20,000. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is far too high. Alice is starting way above your maximum price, so it's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I can only consider a price closer to $5,000."",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a low counteroffer, we signal our budget limitations and our desire for a significantly lower price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer gives us plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards our $8,000 limit.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** Alice's response to this lowball offer will give us valuable information about her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $12,000 is still significantly higher than both your target price and your backup option with John. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're still staying well below her current offer.
* **Staying Below Limit:** The $7,000 counteroffer keeps us below our maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I can do $10,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:**  Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above your ideal limit and your John backup. 
* **One Last Push:** You have room for one more counteroffer before having to seriously consider John's offer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a little lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $8,000, my absolute final offer.  It's a good price for the product, and I'm ready to make the deal happen today if you're agreeable."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is your maximum budget, making it clear to Alice you won't go higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it's your final offer and you're ready to close, you encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Alternative Option:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you're prepared to walk away and take John's deal at $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is firm at $9,000, and you've already stated your absolute maximum is $8,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful.
* **John's Guarantee:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. 
* **Saving Money:**  While getting the product for $8,000 from Alice would have been ideal, opting for John's deal ensures you stay within your budget and don't overspend."
