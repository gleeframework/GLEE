"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $12,000. Given its worth to you is estimated at $8,000, I propose we find a mutually beneficial solution. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price that respects both our interests? Perhaps a negotiation could lead to an agreement that satisfies both parties. Looking forward to your response.",10000.0,Alice,1,
