"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $140, which is a fair price for both of us. ",140.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $152, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,5,
