"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product's value while also recognizing its worth to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a bit more reasonable than my initial offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a good price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,030,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
