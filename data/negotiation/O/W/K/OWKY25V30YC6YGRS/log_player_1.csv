"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** My goal is to maximize profit.  Starting at $2,300,000 leaves significant room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" signals that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Starting high sets a reference point that might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable to Bob.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (accept, reject, counter) will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than my target. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range.  I'll reject his offer to signal I'm seeking a higher price but remain open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price. To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value and the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, which is a substantial move designed to show Bob I'm flexible and want to make a deal. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):** However, I'm not meeting him halfway just yet.  This price keeps me above his initial offer and maintains room for further negotiation. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value and potential ROI, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Reciprocity:** By making a significant concession, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
2. **Avoid Stalemate:**  While I'm firm on the price, a large counter-offer prevents the negotiation from stalling too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a lower offer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll gain from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob decreased his offer by only $100,000,  while I decreased mine by $200,000 in the previous round. This suggests he might be getting close to his maximum price.  While $1,700,000 is tempting, I'll try to push him a little further before considering accepting or walking away to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm still very interested in making this work for both of us. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers, at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By proposing a price exactly between our last two offers, I'm demonstrating a strong willingness to find a fair deal.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** I'm getting closer to my walk-away point ($1,500,000 from John). Offering a compromise with a sense of urgency may push Bob to accept or reveal his true limit.
* **Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" that benefits both sides.  

This approach aims to:

1.  **Encourage Agreement:**  A clean, even split of the difference could feel agreeable to Bob.
2.  **Signal Bottom Line (without being explicit):** While not my absolute final offer, moving towards the halfway point signals that I'm nearing my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only slightly above John's standing offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield a marginally better price from Bob. The risk of him walking away and the time cost of further rounds make this a less attractive option. 
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Accepting $1,550,000 represents a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,000,000) and is a strong return overall. 

While I could try to squeeze out a little more, the potential gains are outweighed by the risks and the guaranteed offer from John. It's time to close the deal with Bob."
