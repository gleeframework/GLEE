"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price. To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value and the significant return on investment you'll see.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a lower offer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll gain from the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm still very interested in making this work for both of us. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers, at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value you're getting.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the value of the product.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
