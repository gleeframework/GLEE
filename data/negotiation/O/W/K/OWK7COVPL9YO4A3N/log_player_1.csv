{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 price:**  I'm starting slightly above Bob's perceived value of $80, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. 
* **Friendly message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage with the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants.

I'm aware that John is willing to pay $100, but I'm trying to maximize my profits. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself, always keeping in mind John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round. 

* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, so selling to John is my fallback option.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's room for negotiation, as Bob clearly wants the product and has already indicated a willingness to pay more than his initial $80 valuation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Gain leverage:** Show Bob I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially increase the price:**  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $85. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to make the price more appealing. 
* **Maintaining a margin:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, allowing me to make a profit while potentially securing a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to weigh whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $90.  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, I'm now starting to run the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers, and I could end up stuck with John's $100 offer, which is less than what I'm hoping to get.
* **Time factor:** The negotiation is already taking some time, and I'd rather secure a deal now than risk further delays and potentially lower profits.
* **Acceptable profit margin:** $90 is a decent profit margin considering my minimum acceptable price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and a profit, which is a good outcome."
