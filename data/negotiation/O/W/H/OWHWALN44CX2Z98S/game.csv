"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $110?  That's still a great price for a product worth much more.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can we do that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $105 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $112? This is the best price I can offer.  Let me know what you think.",112.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're not willing to go higher than $108. I'm still at $112, but to show my good faith, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110.  This is my final offer, and it's a great price for this product.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to have to pass on this deal if we can't meet at a lower price. My final offer is $107. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",107.0,Bob,8,
