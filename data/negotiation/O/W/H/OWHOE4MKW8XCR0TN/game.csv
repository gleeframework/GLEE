"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I could do $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still stretching my budget. I can do $7,000, and I think that's a very fair offer.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
