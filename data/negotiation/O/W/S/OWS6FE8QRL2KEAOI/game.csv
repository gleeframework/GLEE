"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's within your budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price going back up to $800,000. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $775,000 still doesn't quite cover the value of this product. Let's split the difference. How about $787,500? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so how about $787,500 is not the top of my budget, let me try $762,500. I think that's a fair price for the product.",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $762,500 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap. I'm willing to come down to $775,000.  It's a fair offer, and I think it's the best we can do.  Let's seal this deal.",775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $775,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $767,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",767500.0,Bob,8,
