"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which would still leave you with a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price represents a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this amount.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $862,500, which is halfway between my last offer and your current offer. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",862500.0,Bob,6,
