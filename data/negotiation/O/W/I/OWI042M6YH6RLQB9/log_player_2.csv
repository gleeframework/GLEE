Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.

I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can push for a lower price.  By rejecting her offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Also, I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $862,500, which is halfway between my last offer and your current offer. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 862500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $893,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $893,750.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a lower price, Alice has shown that she is not willing to go much lower. Accepting this offer allows me to purchase the product for a price that is still significantly lower than buying from John.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I will be able to negotiate a lower price."
