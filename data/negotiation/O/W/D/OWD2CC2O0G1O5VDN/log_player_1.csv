Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
