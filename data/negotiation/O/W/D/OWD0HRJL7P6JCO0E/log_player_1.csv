Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $9,500, you're aiming to capture the majority of the potential profit ($2,000) while still leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternatives.

This strategy balances risk and reward:

* **High Offer, Potential for High Reward:** While there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, starting high gives you room to potentially secure a very favorable deal. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
