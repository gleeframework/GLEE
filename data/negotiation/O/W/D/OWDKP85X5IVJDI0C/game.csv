"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can stretch my budget to $125. Can you consider this price?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the product at a price that fits your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by offering $125 earlier. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $122. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",122.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $118 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",118.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $122 and $118. I can offer you the product for $120. This is my final offer.",120.0,Alice,7,
