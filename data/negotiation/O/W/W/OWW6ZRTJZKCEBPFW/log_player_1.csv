Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point because it's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120).  I want to leave some room for negotiation, but also maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is only slightly less than my initial offer of $100, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
