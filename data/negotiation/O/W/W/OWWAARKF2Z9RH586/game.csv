"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $10000.  It's the most I can afford, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far apart from $10000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I'm now offering the product for $12500. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I hope you'll consider it a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm going to stick to my original offer of $10000, and I truly hope you'll consider it. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a good value for your product.",10000.0,Bob,6,
