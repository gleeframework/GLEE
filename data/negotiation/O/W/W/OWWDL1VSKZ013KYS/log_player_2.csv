# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $250 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product but would like to offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can meet your price of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $175. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $175 is still above his maximum of $150. He should continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $175 is still a bit high for me. How about $125?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm now offering the product to you for $150, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $150 is his maximum budget, and this is the lowest price Alice is willing to go.  There's no point in further negotiation, especially since John is also offering the product for $150."
