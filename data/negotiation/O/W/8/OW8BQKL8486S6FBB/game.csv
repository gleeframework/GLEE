"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $600,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a substantial investment for both of us, and I want to find a number that works.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm prepared to make one more significant move to bridge that gap.  My final offer is $1,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. That last offer is closer, but I still can't meet you at that price.  To be honest, my budget is capped, and I'm willing to pay $750,000. If that doesn't work, I might need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
