"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  I'm beginning significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting reasons why the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I encourage a dialogue and signal a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is far below both my minimum and his own perceived value. It's clear he's aiming extremely low to test my boundaries.  I'll reject this and counter in the next round, but I need to start moving the negotiation along more quickly as I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $600,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a substantial investment for both of us, and I want to find a number that works."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reframe:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer without agreeing to it, and I reframe his lowball offer as him ""trying to find a good deal"" rather than insulting the product's worth.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making a significant price reduction ($200,000) to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm staying well above both my minimum and his initial offer.
* **Emphasize Shared Investment:** I highlight that this is a significant decision for both parties, subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and encouraging a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Time Pressure (Implicit):** While I don't explicitly mention John, the faster pace of my price reduction suggests I'm serious about moving towards a deal or considering other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000, which indicates he's still significantly underestimating the product's value or trying to take advantage of my time constraint. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, I'm not feeling pressured to accept low offers.  
* **Need for Stronger Signal:** I will reject this offer to signal that his current negotiation tactic isn't working. My next counteroffer will be my last significant concession to try and gauge if a deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm prepared to make one more significant move to bridge that gap.  My final offer is $1,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to signal the seriousness of the situation and the limited time remaining.
* **Significant Concession but with Bottom Line:**  I'm dropping to $1,250,000, which is a $150,000 reduction and very close to my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing this as a balanced approach - recognizing his interest while emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Call to Action:** I'm ending with ""Let me know your thoughts"" to prompt a response and decision from Bob.

This offer will help me determine:

* **Bob's True Interest:**  Is he genuinely interested in negotiating a fair price, or is he simply trying to lowball me?
* **Next Steps:** If he rejects this offer, I'll likely walk away and sell to John to avoid wasting more time on a potentially fruitless negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. That last offer is closer, but I still can't meet you at that price.  To be honest, my budget is capped, and I'm willing to pay $750,000. If that doesn't work, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Bob's offer of $750,000 shows he's not engaging in good faith negotiations. Despite my significant price reductions and clear communication about my final offer, his counter is still far below both my minimum and a reasonable compromise point.
* **Time Value:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. I've given him ample opportunity to meet me closer to my price, and his responses suggest he's not willing to do so.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to move on from Bob and secure the deal with John."
