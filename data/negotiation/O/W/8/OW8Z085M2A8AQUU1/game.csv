"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering my needs and the value you're seeking.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1000000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value justifies this price. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still out of my range. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $900000, which would be $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $925000, which is closer to my budget. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,
