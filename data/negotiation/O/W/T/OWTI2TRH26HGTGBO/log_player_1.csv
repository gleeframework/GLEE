Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher if he's inclined. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is well above your $100 minimum, ensuring a profit regardless.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John's offer ($100) if Bob rejects the proposal."
