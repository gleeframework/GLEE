Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $60 is far too low for me, considering my minimum value for the product is $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for at least $125.  This reflects the value of the product and the costs involved.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $90? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still too far below my target. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm also getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the costs involved.  If you're serious about buying it, let's make this happen.  If not, I might have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $100?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'm getting closer to selling to John, but I'll give Bob one more counteroffer to see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $105.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying it, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be selling to John."", ""product_price"": 105}
