# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($9,500) is better than John's offer ($12,000).** You save $2,500 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though you value the product at $12,000, getting it for $9,500 is a good deal.** You're still paying less than your perceived value and saving money."
