You can get a better deal than $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $9,000. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's $1,000 above her value. It's also a significant savings for me compared to John's price."

$9,500 is a good deal for me, it's within my budget and still a decent profit for Alice. It's time to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
