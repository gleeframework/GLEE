Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. It also gives me some room to negotiate higher if Bob makes a counteroffer.  However, it's still well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still do better. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to the $10,000 I initially proposed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still below my initial proposal.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher price.  I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle with Bob."
