"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is seriously interested and to gauge his potential budget.  I'm leaving room to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm confident Bob is willing to pay closer to this number. I want to close the deal before I risk running out of rounds and having to settle for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally get a higher price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting close to my minimum and we are getting low on rounds.  It's not a bad deal, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
