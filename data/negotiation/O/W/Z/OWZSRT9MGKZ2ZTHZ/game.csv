"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit to $18,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",18000.0,Alice,3,
