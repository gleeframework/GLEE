Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me, I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a bit lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum value, and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his last offer."

Bob's offer remains at $100, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee he'll budge, and I risk wasting time.  Selling to John for $120 ensures I get a decent price and avoids further negotiation."
