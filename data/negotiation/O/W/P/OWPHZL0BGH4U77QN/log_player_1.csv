Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer but still not quite where I want it to be. At this point, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price from Bob, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed sale and a fair price."
