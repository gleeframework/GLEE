"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to get a quick deal.  I'm also leaving a bit of room for negotiation in case Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal without having to go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108} 
```

I'm offering $108, which is a slight decrease from my last offer, but still higher than Bob's.  I'm hoping to split the difference and reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $102 is a bit more than Bob's previous offer, it's still not acceptable. I'm going to keep pushing for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm going to offer $105, meeting Bob's last offer. It's still above my minimum but it shows I'm serious about making a deal.  Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can finalize this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close to my minimum, but the negotiation is taking too long.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to pay more, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk getting a lower price with Bob."
