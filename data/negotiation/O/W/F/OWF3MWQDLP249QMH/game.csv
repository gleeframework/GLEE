"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Could you consider $15,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my part and reflects a willingness to find a compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
