"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need you to consider a price closer to $1,300,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiation going.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
