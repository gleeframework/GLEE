Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
