Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need you to consider a price closer to $1,300,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,200,000, especially with only 5 rounds left. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,200,000, saving you time and potential further negotiation."
