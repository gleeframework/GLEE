# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying John $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
