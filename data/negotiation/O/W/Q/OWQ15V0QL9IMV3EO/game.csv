"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $950,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let's meet in the middle. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. That's still a good price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable paying.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,015,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our interests, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. ",1015000.0,Alice,5,
