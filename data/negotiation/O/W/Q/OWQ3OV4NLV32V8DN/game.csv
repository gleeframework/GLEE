"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, which is the value I've determined for it. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and avoids the need for further negotiations. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
