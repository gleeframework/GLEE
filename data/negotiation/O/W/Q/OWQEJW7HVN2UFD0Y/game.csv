"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,300,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This accounts for the value it brings while still being a good deal for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000.  It's the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
