# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $1,200,000. He should counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This accounts for the value it brings while still being a good deal for you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $1,600,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should counteroffer again to try to negotiate a price closer to his limit."
