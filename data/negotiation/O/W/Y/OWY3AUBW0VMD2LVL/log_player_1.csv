Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 initially gives room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob strengthens my position and makes him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not asking for the full $120, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured.

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price. I can likely get more.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is clearly interested in the product,  so there's room for a higher counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding hasty decisions:** Selling to John immediately would secure a profit, but I want to see if I can push for a better deal with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial $100 to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit low for me, considering its value.  How about we split the difference and meet at $92.50? I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85).  This shows willingness to negotiate and gives Bob a reasonable option.
* **Value reinforcement:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its worth and justifying my higher price. 
* **Positive framing:** Using language like ""split the difference"" and ""investment"" emphasizes a fair deal and the potential for value.

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I aim to reach a price closer to my initial target while still showing flexibility and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $2.50 away from my previous counteroffer of $92.50. This is a good compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit ($10 more than selling to John) and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial $100,  accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and profitable choice at this point."
