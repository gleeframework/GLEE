"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've poured my heart and soul into, and I know it has the potential to be a real game-changer for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1150000.  This price reflects its true worth, while still leaving room for you to profit handsomely. Let's discuss this further and see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,150,000 is lower than $1,200,000.
* **You have room for profit:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product and still have $50,000 of your budget left."
