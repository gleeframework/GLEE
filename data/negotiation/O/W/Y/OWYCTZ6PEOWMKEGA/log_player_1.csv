Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for potential compromise. 

I am hoping Bob values the product highly and accepts this first offer. However, I am prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to lower my price a bit, but still want to secure a profit above my minimum value. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still being significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while I could counter again, it's becoming clear that he's unlikely to meet my price expectations. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's time to move on."
