"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, given its potential value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.
* **Potential for savings:** Bob has a significant buffer ($100,000) between Alice's offer and his maximum price. This gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Exploring the negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant discount:** This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating.
* **Reasonable offer:** $950,000 is still a profitable sale for Alice, considering her minimum acceptable price is $800,000.
* **Opening for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further discussion and potential compromise, without immediately jeopardizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has come down in price, there is still a gap between her offer and Bob's desired price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob can likely secure a lower price by continuing to negotiate, given Alice is now demonstrating flexibility.
* **Risk of losing opportunity:**  Although buying from John is always an option, Bob is likely to get a better price with continued negotiation with Alice."
