"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $850,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's valuation. This counteroffer of $820,000 is a reasonable starting point, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount compared to the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $840,000 is a good deal, it's still not as good as Bob's initial counteroffer of $820,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a price closer to his initial counteroffer.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 830000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increasing his offer slightly from $820,000 to $830,000, showing that he's willing to compromise but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer. This counteroffer might be more appealing to Alice than the previous one, increasing the chance of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $835,000 is only $5,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly better price.  It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $165,000 compared to buying from John, and is likely close to the best price he can get.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and finalize the purchase."
