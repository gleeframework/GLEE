Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Bob's higher valuation allows for a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a good portion of the potential value for Bob ($100,000). This makes the offer highly appealing to him while still securing a significant profit ($200,000) for me. 
* **First Right of Refusal:** By approaching Bob first, I am essentially giving him a ""first right of refusal"" at a premium price. This approach acknowledges the product's higher value to Bob while still prioritizing my own financial gain."
