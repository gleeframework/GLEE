# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is a significant drop from her initial price, it's still above my budget of $80. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than my budget of $80. While it's getting closer, I'm going to reject it and see if I can negotiate a lower price. It's better to keep trying than to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with.  There's still time left in the negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $125 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
