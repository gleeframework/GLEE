"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and features, it's valued at $150 by you. I would like to extend this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $120. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best value while allowing me to maximize my earnings. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is lower than the maximum you're willing to pay ($150) and higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($80). This means you can get a good deal while still allowing Alice to make a profit. Buying from John would cost you more."
