"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals Bob's serious interest in the product while setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on the product, and I'd be happy to pay $9,500. This is a fair price, and hopefully, we can close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly working towards his target price.  By offering $9,500, he's showing he's serious about buying the product while still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise, and it signals to Alice that Bob is willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I think we can finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget and represents a compromise from Alice, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to push for a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she's already made multiple concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility in negotiating. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap with Alice while staying within his budget. By offering $9,750, he's demonstrating his commitment to purchasing the product while staying close to his $8,000 limit.  This counteroffer leaves some room for Alice to come down slightly if she wants to close the deal."
