"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details at this point, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects the potential benefits I see in this product for you, and I believe it's a fair proposition. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Even though Alice claims the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, you have no way to verify this. It's always better to err on the side of caution and stick to your budget, especially since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000."
