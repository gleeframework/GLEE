"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider $10,200, which is a small increase from your last offer. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,5,
