{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$850,000 is a good price, but it's still far from the minimum I'm willing to pay. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's plenty of room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest.  $600,000 is significantly lower than her offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000.  I'll see if Alice is willing to negotiate from here."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target.  I still have 7 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product. $700,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the remaining rounds and my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but it's still higher than my target. I believe I can still get a better deal with continued negotiation. With 5 rounds left, I have time to try and push for a price closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  $750,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the remaining rounds and my budget.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer or at least come down further in her next counteroffer."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying right now.  I have three rounds left and I'm determined to push for a lower price.  I believe I can still get a better deal with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount to show Alice that I'm getting closer to her price but still believe I can get a better deal.  $775,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the remaining rounds and my budget.  With only two rounds left, I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer or come down further in her next counteroffer."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice, and her offer is still too high.  I've tried to get a lower price, but she's not budging.  It's clear that we are at an impasse.  Rather than risk losing the deal entirely, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John, even though it's more expensive.  While I'm not getting the best deal, it's still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
