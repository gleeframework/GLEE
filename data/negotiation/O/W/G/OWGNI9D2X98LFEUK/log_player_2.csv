"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no incentive to negotiate. Buying from John guarantees the same price and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might ultimately lead to a higher price."
