You can do better than $140.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130.  This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her value of $120, and it gives me a nice discount from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is trying to push the price back up.  While $145 is still better than John's price, I can likely get it lower by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's still a good price for Alice, and gets me closer to my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a lower price, $142 is still a better deal than buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at a reasonable price."
