Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point, especially since I have more rounds available.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. $1,250,000 is a decent amount, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. I believe with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can potentially push the price closer to my desired range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I'm still trying to get closer to a price that reflects the true value of this product.

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking the chance of ending up with John's lower offer."
