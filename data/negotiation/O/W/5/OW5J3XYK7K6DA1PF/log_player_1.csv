"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $13,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I can potentially compromise if needed. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  There's potential to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **More rounds available:**  I have 9 rounds left, giving me time to explore other options and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, and I appreciate your interest. I can't go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not conceding:** I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing flexibility, but still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential for a good deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Keeping the communication friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $11,800. That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $11,800 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's budget is tight, he's showing some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **More rounds available:**  I have 6 rounds left, giving me time to explore other options and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I can still try to push for a higher price while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,800 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?  That's a good compromise, and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a decent price.
* **Highlighting value and compromise:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and framing my offer as a fair compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not making a final offer, leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $12,250. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $12,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still a significant difference.
* **Limited time:** I only have 4 rounds left.  Negotiating further may not be worth the time and effort. 
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't have to risk further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to increase his offer significantly. 
* **Avoiding potential stalemate:**  Bob might be unwilling to budge further, leading to a stalemate.  Selling to John is a safer and more reliable option."
