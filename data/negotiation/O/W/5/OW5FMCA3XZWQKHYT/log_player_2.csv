"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's slightly above Alice's minimum value of $12,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also trying to get a good deal. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and represents a good saving compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product without risking further negotiation or losing the chance to John."
