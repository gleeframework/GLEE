"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the full value of the product for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $850,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. I believe $900,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

I'm making a small concession this round. $890,000 is still a good profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal and am willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum price, and there's a risk that I could keep going back and forth with Bob and end up selling to John for less.  I'm willing to take the $880,000 and close the deal."
