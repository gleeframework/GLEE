"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in paying $90 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90.  While that's a good deal, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $100, you're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
