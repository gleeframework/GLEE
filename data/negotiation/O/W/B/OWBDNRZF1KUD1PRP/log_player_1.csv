Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and my desired return, and I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a significant discount compared to what you could gain from it. Please let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While the offer is already strong, offering $925,000 leaves a little wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so we don't want to go lower than that. 

This strategy aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit while ensuring Bob sees the offer as highly attractive."
