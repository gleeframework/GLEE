"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,600,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. I'm prepared to come down to $1,675,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1675000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,625,000 is closer to my goal, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping we can find common ground and close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,625,000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
