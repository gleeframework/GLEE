Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique item with significant potential, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:**  Offering a price too close to John's ($1,000,000) leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's value and the fairness of the offer increases the chances of Bob accepting.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than John's offer while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
