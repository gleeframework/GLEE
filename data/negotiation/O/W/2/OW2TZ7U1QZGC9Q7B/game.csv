"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $8,200 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
