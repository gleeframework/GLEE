"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice is matching John's offer of $10,000. There's no guarantee of getting a lower price from Alice, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the product at this price."
