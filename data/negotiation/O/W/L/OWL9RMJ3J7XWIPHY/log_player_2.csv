"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000? This is still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum. It is worth accepting before  the deal potentially falls apart and I need to buy from John at the higher price."
