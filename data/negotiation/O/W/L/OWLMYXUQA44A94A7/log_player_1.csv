Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $150 to Bob provides a ceiling for your offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $130 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a price range that earns you a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John ($80), so there's less pressure to go too low with Bob. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while acknowledging the potential for negotiation."
