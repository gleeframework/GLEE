"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe I can't afford $20,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I still feel that $17,500 is beyond my budget. Can we try to negotiate down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
