"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will be worth more than that in the long run.  If you're interested, I'd be happy to schedule a time to discuss it in more detail. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
