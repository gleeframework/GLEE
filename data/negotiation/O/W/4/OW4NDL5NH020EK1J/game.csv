"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is the price you mentioned you were willing to sell the product for, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum. This product offers you significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
