# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I'll make a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the amount that Alice is willing to sell the product for.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum. This product offers you significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. Would you consider $1,350,000?
