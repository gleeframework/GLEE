"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the move towards a compromise, I still feel that $11,000 is a bit steep. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
