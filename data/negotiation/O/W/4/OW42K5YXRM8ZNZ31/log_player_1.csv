"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being open to negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible and find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to find a more favorable price. Selling to John is an option, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to explore the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Counter with a Reasonable Offer:** $11,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. 
* **Focus on Value and Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and framing my counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests. By showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, I hope to reach a deal that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the move towards a compromise, I still feel that $11,000 is a bit steep. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Negotiation is Progressing:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer shows he's serious about buying the product. This gives me confidence that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is On My Side:** I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. This gives me the leverage to push for a higher price. Selling to John would be a guaranteed profit, but I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm still willing to negotiate and am confident I can achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer with your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.

By offering a price that's close to Bob's offer, I hope to incentivize him to accept and finalize the deal.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit margin and a step closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a final price of $10,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Quite:**  While Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have some room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and am confident in the product's value. This maintains my leverage in the negotiation.
* **Time is Still on My Side:** With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to see if Bob is willing to go higher.  Selling to John is still an option, but I'd prefer to get a price closer to my initial goal.

I believe there's a good chance Bob might increase his offer, especially since he's already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation alive and increase the possibility of achieving a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures both of us walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.  It shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive and enthusiastic tone to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Satisfaction:** I highlight the benefits of the deal for both of us, emphasizing that it will leave us both satisfied.

This strategy aims to finalize the deal at a price that's acceptable to both of us.  I believe this offer is compelling enough to motivate Bob to accept, especially since we're so close to the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to consider $10,500, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $10,375 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only 2 rounds remaining, time is running out to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Unlikely Increase:** Bob's offer of $10,375 shows that he's unlikely to budge much further, especially since he's already made several counteroffers.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. With limited time and Bob's unwillingness to significantly increase his offer, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure the guaranteed profit."
