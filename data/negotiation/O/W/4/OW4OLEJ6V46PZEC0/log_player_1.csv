"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I've set the opening price at $2,000,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This tactic provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping in mind John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I can afford to be patient and strategic in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Considering the current market conditions and similar products available, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I started high, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome. Accepting now ensures I achieve my goal without risking a prolonged negotiation that might not lead to a higher price."
