"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for you.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your need for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $925,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $962,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good outcome. What do you say?",962500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we both want to see this deal closed.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $950,000.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to sign today.",950000.0,Bob,6,
