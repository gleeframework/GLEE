Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After considering the situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns better with what I am willing to pay while still acknowledging the product's worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge Bob closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to your business is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the product's value to my business, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975,000. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, which suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount for the product. We're still far enough above John's offer to justify continuing the negotiation. Let's see if we can get Bob closer to $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. To demonstrate my willingness to reach a deal, I'll come down to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly represents the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

We're holding firm at $1,000,000 and presenting it as our final offer to encourage Bob to accept. This way, we're still aiming for a strong profit margin while introducing a sense of urgency to the negotiation."
