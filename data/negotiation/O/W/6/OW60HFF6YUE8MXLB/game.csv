"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you consider $6,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $6,800. This is a reasonable compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $6,800 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $6,600? This is a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a good price.",6600.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $6,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth. What do you think?",6900.0,Alice,5,
