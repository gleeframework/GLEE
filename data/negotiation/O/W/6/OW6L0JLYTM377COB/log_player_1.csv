Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it sets a high anchor point.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying the price in his mind. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a pre-public offer creates a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,000.  You'll need to be prepared to potentially negotiate down if he rejects the initial offer. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
