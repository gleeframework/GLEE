"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
