"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. While her message tries to frame the price as ""competitive,"" it's crucial to negotiate for a better deal. You have room to counteroffer and aim for a price closer to your $1,200,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting its value to me."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  This counteroffer aims for a price significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. While it's ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation while still staying under your $1,200,000 limit.
* **Justification:**  The message politely explains your budget limitations and positions the counteroffer as fair based on your valuation of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting with a lower offer, you give yourself space to potentially meet in the middle with Alice if she counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account its value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your range, but the offer is still above your ideal price and your fallback option (buying from John).  You have room to negotiate further and aim to get closer to the $1,200,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be open to $1,150,000? I'm trying to be realistic about my budget."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Alice showed willingness to move from her initial price, so further negotiation is likely to yield a better deal.
* **Strategic Counter:**  This offer splits the difference between her last offer ($1,250,000) and your previous offer ($1,050,000). It signals that you're serious about buying but need her to meet you closer to your range. 
* **Budget Focus:** Reiterating your budget constraints reinforces the idea that this isn't just about haggling but about finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price ($1,225,000) is now within a reasonable range of your best alternative (buying from John for $1,200,000). 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice backing out or hardening her position. This offer represents a good balance between getting a decent price and securing the product."
