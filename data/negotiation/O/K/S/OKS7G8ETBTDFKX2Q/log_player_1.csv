"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to leverage the fact that the product is worth more to me than Bob. This will allow me to negotiate downwards while still potentially getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'll reject the offer and try to push for a higher price.  There's a good chance Bob will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price above my minimum threshold.  This shows flexibility but also demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  The risk of selling to John for $1,000,000 is still too high at this point, as I believe I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility, but also demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm running out of time and I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum price.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum requirement. It's time to take the sure thing."
