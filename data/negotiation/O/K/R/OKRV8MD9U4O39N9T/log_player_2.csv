Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations for this product.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to show my commitment to a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to your company. Let's see if we can close this deal.
