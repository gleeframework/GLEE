"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price of $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. $175 is a reasonable price considering my minimum value and the fact that I have the option to sell to John for $150. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately undercut my own value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget for this product is $100. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to make at least $150 to be satisfied, and $100 is not even covering my minimum value. While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate. It's worth holding out for a better offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply not feasible for me.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum value of $150 but offering a significant discount to Bob.  $125 is a compromise and shows good faith. It also allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110 for the product. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $110 is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $150, and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping my option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm trying to close the gap with Bob while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit.  $135 is a good compromise, and it shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product's market value is closer to $110 than $135. I would like to propose $120 as a fair price. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but $120 is still below my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for a higher price.  I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your research, but I still believe $120 is undervalues the product.  We're getting close, though.  I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's a significant compromise, but still ensures I make a decent profit.  I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not desperate to sell.  $140 is a good starting point for the final round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price. However, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my maximum budget. I am willing to pay $130 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. $130 is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough. I have two rounds left, and I'm confident that I can either negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and we're getting closer.  However, I'm still not comfortable going below $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal and call it a day."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm sticking to my last offer of $135. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm trying to emphasize that we're close to a deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not going to budge much further. It's now or never for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, after careful consideration, I am willing to pay $130 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is the final round. Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum value of $150. I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is a better deal for me.  I'm not willing to settle for less, so I'll choose to sell the product to John."
