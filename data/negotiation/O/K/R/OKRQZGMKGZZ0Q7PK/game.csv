"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price of $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget for this product is $100. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply not feasible for me.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110 for the product. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product's market value is closer to $110 than $135. I would like to propose $120 as a fair price. I hope this meets your expectations.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your research, but I still believe $120 is undervalues the product.  We're getting close, though.  I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price. However, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my maximum budget. I am willing to pay $130 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and we're getting closer.  However, I'm still not comfortable going below $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal and call it a day.",135.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, after careful consideration, I am willing to pay $130 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product and my budget constraints.",130.0,Bob,10,
