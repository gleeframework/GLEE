"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get closer to a price that's good for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:**  While I want to save money, I also don't want to lowball Alice to the point where she's no longer interested in negotiating. $7,000 gives her some room to come down while still being a price I'm happy with.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important in negotiations. I want to keep the conversation positive while clearly stating my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $8,500, which is a compromise between our two numbers. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. While $8,500 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above her value for the product ($8,000).  I'm willing to counteroffer again to try and reach a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That seems like a good compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly between our previous offers. This signals a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Targeting Her Value:** $8,000 is Alice's estimated value for the product. While I don't know this for sure, it's a strategic guess that might be tempting enough for her to accept. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** I'm continuing to use a respectful and friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and productive."
