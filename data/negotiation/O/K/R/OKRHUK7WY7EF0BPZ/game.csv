"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial price, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $900000. This is a good middle ground, and I believe you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Would you be willing to consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $825000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $875000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. This price reflects the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can offer you a price of $850000, which is the same as your initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a price you're willing to accept, as it's the highest you've mentioned so far. Let me know if this is a deal-breaker or not.",850000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $850000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $850000. How about we meet at $837500? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",837500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $850000, just like you suggested. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to $837500. I can offer you a price of $838000. This is a small increment, but it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept.",838000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not sure if $838000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $835000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. Will you accept this price?",835000.0,Bob,10,
