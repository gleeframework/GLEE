"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to capture a large portion of the surplus value.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with some negotiation.  I'm willing to consider a counteroffer, but I'm not going to settle for $10,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  This counteroffer should encourage Bob to compromise, as he knows he won't get the product for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm raising the offer slightly from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but am not willing to settle for too low a price. This counteroffer should encourage Bob to accept, as it's only a small difference from his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to take the $9,000, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal.  It's getting late in the game, but I'm going to make one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm coming down to nearly my minimum, but I still believe the product is worth more to Bob than this price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and with only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and close the negotiation."
