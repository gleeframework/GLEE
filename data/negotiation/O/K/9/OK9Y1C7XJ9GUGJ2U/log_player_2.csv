"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I am extending an initial offer of $1350000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. He has a clear goal of paying no more than $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his target of $1,200,000. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To make this work, I'm going to need to stick with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his target, it's still above his maximum price. He should continue to negotiate in the hopes of getting Alice down to his desired price. There's still room for a counteroffer before he needs to consider buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In order to move forward, I am willing to consider $1250000 as the final price for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  This is the lowest price Alice has offered so far, and it's only $50,000 over his target price.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price from Alice, and he's running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
