"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. If Bob rejects, I can see if he's willing to come up closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. It's still above my minimum value, but a lower offer than my initial price. Hopefully, this encourages Bob to come up a bit, or at least shows him I'm serious about getting a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. It's getting a little risky, as I'm starting to run out of rounds, but I think I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is right in the middle between my minimum value and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this will be enough to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still going to reject it.  I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to make my final offer at my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk selling to John for the same price. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum value. It's better to sell to John for $12,000 than risk getting a lower offer or ending the negotiation with no sale."
