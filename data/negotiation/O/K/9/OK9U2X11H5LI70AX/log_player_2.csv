"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you'll be very interested in. It has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm asking for $1000000 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still too high for the first round. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to offer $700,000 for the product, given its potential. I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come down a bit more."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  A significant reduction from $1,000,000 to $700,000 shows I'm serious about negotiating and trying to get a good deal.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a rationale for the counteroffer, highlighting the product's potential while emphasizing my budget constraints.
* **Open to Discussion:**  This keeps the door open for further negotiation and shows flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $700000.  The product's true potential is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $850000?  I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $850,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident I can push for a lower price.  I want to see if she'll be willing to budge further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. To be fair, I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point there."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on Budget:** I reiterate the budget constraint to justify my counteroffer.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** I'm explicitly seeking a ""meeting point,"" suggesting flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
