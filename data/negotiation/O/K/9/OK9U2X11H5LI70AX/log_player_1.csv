Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to offer $700000 for the product, given its potential. I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to come down a bit more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially considering the potential value of the product.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $700,000.  The product's true potential is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. To be fair, I'm willing to go up to $800000.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $800,000. While I'd prefer a bit more,  I'm running out of rounds and  this is a good price."
