"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $800,000, which would be $850,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $820,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $820,000, which would be $835,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",835000.0,Alice,5,
