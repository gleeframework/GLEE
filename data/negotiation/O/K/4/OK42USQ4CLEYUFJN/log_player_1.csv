``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at the highest possible price.  It's a strong starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate further.  I believe the value of the product to Bob will motivate him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
