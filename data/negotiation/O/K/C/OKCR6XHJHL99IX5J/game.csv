"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity! This product is truly unique and has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business. Let's be reasonable - how about $1,100,000? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'll pay $950,000 for the product. Is this a price you're willing to accept?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference at $1,025,000? This is a fair offer, and we can both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go above $900,000, Alice. This is the highest I can go. Is this a price you're willing to accept?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.  I really want to work with you, but if this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, Alice. This is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,8,
