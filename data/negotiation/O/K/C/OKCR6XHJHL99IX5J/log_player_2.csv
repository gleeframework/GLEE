Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business. Let's be reasonable - how about $1,100,000? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference at $1,025,000? This is a fair offer, and we can both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?
