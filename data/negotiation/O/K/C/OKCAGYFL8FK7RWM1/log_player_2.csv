{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This seems like a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:** You're getting the product for $111, which is a $9 savings compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Alice indicated this is her final offer. If you reject and counter, you risk her walking away, forcing you to buy from John at full price."
