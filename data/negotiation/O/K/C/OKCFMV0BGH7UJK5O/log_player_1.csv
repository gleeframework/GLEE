"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob's valuation is unknown. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher price.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value.  This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I've got 6 rounds left and can always sell to John if this deal falls through. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's getting closer to my minimum value. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I've got a few rounds left, but there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob. It's time to take the deal and secure the sale."
