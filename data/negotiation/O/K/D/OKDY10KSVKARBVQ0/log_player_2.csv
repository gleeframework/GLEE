Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11400, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating with Alice, but it's clear that they are not going to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of them.  Alice is not willing to go lower than $11,400, which is still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price.

At this point, with only 3 rounds left, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000.  While this is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's the best available option to ensure he gets the product within the time limit and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
