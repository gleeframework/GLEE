I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to make a profit.  I'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible but still aim for a higher price.  I'm confident that Bob, wanting to make a profit, will likely accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and while $940,000 is a decent price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John's offer is a sure thing, and I'd rather guarantee a sale at that price than risk losing a higher sale altogether."
