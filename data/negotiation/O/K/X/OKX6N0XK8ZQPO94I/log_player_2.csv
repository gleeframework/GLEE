Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway. At this price, he's only $200 above Alice's perceived value, and it's likely she'll accept this offer.  If she rejects, Bob can always buy from John, which is his fallback option."

```
