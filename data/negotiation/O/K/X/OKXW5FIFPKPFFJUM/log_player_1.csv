Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is willing to counter. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A high initial offer sets a strong baseline and allows for potential concessions later. 
* **Knowing John's Offer:**  I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price. 

Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering.  

I'll counter Bob with a price closer to my starting point, but still lower than my initial offer. I'll see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** $15,000 is halfway between my initial offer of $18,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $10,000. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I make a profit.

I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches my minimum acceptable value.
* **No Further Gain:**  I'm not likely to get a higher offer from Bob, and John is also offering $12,000.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids further negotiation rounds, saving time.

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice given the circumstances."
