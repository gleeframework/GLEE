"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your position, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
