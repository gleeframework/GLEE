Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While my minimum selling price is confidential, I'm offering you the first opportunity to purchase it.  Would a price of $900,000 be agreeable to you?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We aim to get as close to Bob's $800,000 valuation as possible without going below our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $900,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice makes a profit.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
