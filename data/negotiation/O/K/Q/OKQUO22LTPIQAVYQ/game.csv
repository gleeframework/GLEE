"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a price that reflects its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I think this is a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and our willingness to negotiate.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
