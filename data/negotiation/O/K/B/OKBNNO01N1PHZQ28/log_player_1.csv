"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $13,500 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about meeting halfway at $11,000? This price reflects the quality and benefits this product offers."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a potential $500 profit.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
