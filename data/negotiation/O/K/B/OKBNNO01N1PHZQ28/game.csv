"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about meeting halfway at $11,000? This price reflects the quality and benefits this product offers.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
