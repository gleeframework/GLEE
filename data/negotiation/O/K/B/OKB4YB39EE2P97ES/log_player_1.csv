"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is high-quality, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I could go up to $10,000 if that would work for you. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some movement here which is good. To be candid, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming more appealing, but I value our interaction. Let's make this happen - $14,000 and we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a big stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer of $12,000 is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.  It's unlikely Bob will reach $15,000 in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to cut her losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
