"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is high-quality, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I could go up to $10,000 if that would work for you. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some movement here which is good. To be candid, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming more appealing, but I value our interaction. Let's make this happen - $14,000 and we have a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a big stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,6,
