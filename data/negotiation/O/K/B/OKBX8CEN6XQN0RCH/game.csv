"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too far below what I need to sell this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
