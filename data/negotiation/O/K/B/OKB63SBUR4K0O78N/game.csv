"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we try to find a middle ground again? I'm willing to meet you at $105. It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
