Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $11,500 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects your offer.
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:**  This allows for a back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.

Keep in mind, however, that you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if you're not satisfied with the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $11,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still within a range where I can negotiate further.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still not able to go above $11,000 for the product. Would $11,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob has repeatedly refused to budge from his $11,000 offer. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm confident I can sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a better deal for me.  I'll take John's offer and move on."
