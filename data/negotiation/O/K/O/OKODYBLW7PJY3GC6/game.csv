"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  It's still a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
