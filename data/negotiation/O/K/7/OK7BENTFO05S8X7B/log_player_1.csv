Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal:** Offering it at $140 gives Bob a potential discount while still netting you a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Direct and clear:** The message is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity that might hinder the negotiation. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob rejects the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while staying above your minimum acceptable price."
