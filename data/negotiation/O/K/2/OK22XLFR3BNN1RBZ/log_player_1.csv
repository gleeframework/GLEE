"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn a decent profit.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's $15,000 offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe there's still room for improvement. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still above my minimum price, and it's closer to his offer, which hopefully will make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now $13,500. This is only $1,500 less than my minimum price and is a good compromise.  There's a risk that if I reject this offer and counter, Bob might get frustrated and walk away, and I might have to sell to John, earning only $15,000. It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
