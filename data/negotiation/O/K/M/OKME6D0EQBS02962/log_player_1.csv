"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept $8,000, which is my minimum price. If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we're running out of rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I can't afford to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
