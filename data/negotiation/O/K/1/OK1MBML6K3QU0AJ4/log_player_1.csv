I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000 from John.  

My reasoning is:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I'm aiming high, hoping Bob values the product more than $1,500,000 and is willing to pay a premium.
* **No risk:** If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John at a decent profit. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing a sale."
