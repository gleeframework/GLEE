"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $85. I can offer it to you for $87.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",87.5,Alice,3,
