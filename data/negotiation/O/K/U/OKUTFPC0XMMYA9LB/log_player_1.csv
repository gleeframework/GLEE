Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $900,000 is appealing, I'm confident this product offers you a significant return on investment above that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?
