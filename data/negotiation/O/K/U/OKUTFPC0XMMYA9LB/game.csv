"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant value this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $900,000 is appealing, I'm confident this product offers you a significant return on investment above that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value proposition and ensures a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
