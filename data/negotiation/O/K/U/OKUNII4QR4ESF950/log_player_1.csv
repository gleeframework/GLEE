This offer is a good starting point because it's within Bob's budget and still allows me to make a profit. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Bob's offer is too low for me, and I am still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I will try to get a better deal in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to go above $10,500 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

Bob is firm on his offer, and it's getting close to my minimum price. However, I am still more confident in getting my desired price from John. It's not ideal to lose the $1,500 potential profit from a higher offer, but I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale at my minimum value."
