"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit margin while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your considerations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This still offers you a great opportunity to make a profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer as my budget is quite tight, but I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
