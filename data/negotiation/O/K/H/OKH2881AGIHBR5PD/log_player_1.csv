Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and has a lot of value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will at least consider this offer. If he doesn't accept, I can always lower it slightly or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product has value, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's not ideal, but it avoids any further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
