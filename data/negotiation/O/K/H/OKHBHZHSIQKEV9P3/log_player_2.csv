"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know it's worth more to you, and this price allows for a good margin on both sides. Let me know if you're interested! If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.**  Bob's maximum price is $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,400,000, saving Bob $100,000.
* **Even though Alice's offer is above her own value, it's still a good deal for Bob.** He gets the product for a lower price than he would from John, achieving his goal of saving money."
