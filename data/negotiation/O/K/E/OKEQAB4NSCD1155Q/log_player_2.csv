"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider selling it to me for $10,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for you. It's lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away from the deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
