Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I think $650,000 is still a bit low.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is showing some flexibility, it's unlikely she'll come down to $800,000.  You've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. John's offer provides a guaranteed price within your budget."
