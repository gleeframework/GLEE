"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I think $650,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal today. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
