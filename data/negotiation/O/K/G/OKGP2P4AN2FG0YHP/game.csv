"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still represents a great deal for you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1180000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,220,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This price acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's find common ground.",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to my target price, but I'd like to make one final push to see if we can meet at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
