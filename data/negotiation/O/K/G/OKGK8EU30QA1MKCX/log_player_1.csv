"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000.  It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident it will be a major asset for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the product's benefits for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute bottom line, allowing for a few rounds of negotiation.
* **Preparing for John:** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net in case Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit potential while allowing me to recoup some of the value of this exceptional product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher. 
* **Highlighting value and profit:** I emphasize the product's value and potential for profit for Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Staying flexible:**  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm making it clear that I won't go much lower.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I remain aware of John's offer, giving me confidence to hold firm if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer provides leverage:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, allowing me to hold firm in these negotiations.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it offers you a great deal. Let's seal the deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on value and potential:** I continue emphasizing the product's value and potential to motivate Bob to pay more.
* **Urgency:** I suggest sealing the deal to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me confidence to push for a better price."
