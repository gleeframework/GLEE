"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition and potential for your business, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to you than the asking price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. You have a strong alternative with John, so there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with John's offer."
