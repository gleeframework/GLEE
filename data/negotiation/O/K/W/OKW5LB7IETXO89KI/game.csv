"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's split the difference and close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $108 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's compromise.  I'll go down to $109.  This is my final offer.",109.0,Alice,5,
