Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling on a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This strategy balances risk and reward. While there's a chance Bob might reject a high offer, the potential gain from his acceptance outweighs settling for John's guaranteed $800,000."
