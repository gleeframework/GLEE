"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $12,000 is above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, he should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's also worth considering that John is offering the product for $10,000, making Bob's risk of negotiating with Alice higher.  Therefore, he should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident I can get the value I need from this product, but I can only go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit.  Bob has two compelling reasons to reject the offer:

1. **John's offer:** John is offering the same product for $10,000, making Alice's offer less attractive.
2. **Negotiation potential:** There are still rounds left. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a lower price and potentially save even more money. 

By rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate, Bob can potentially get a better deal without risking going over his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and believe it's worth the value, but my budget is set at $10,000. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer it to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,700 is tempting, it's still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  Considering that:

* **John's offer:** John is offering the same product for exactly $10,000, which is within Bob's budget.
* **Limited rounds:** There are only a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will lower the price further.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures that he gets the product within his budget without risking further negotiation with Alice."
