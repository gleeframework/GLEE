"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's much higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,250,000 is a bit steep. How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,250,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $1,850,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest,  $1,100,000 is about as high as I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
