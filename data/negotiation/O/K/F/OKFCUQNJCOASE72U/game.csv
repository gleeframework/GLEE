"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, given its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product offers a unique set of benefits that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you in the long run. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer.  I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price. I'm willing to make a significant move to show my commitment to getting this deal done. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being willing to compromise. I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
