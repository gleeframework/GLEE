"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, accepting her offer is the best option. It allows you to acquire the product at your maximum budget, saving you any potential negotiation hassle. While buying from John would result in the same price, there's no benefit to doing so when you have an offer already in place."
