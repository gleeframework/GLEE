* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  This is Round 9, and you only have one more round left. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While Alice is unlikely to go lower in the final round, you can still try to counteroffer for $11,000.  If she rejects, you can still buy from John for $15,000.

**Conclusion:**

It's a good time to accept Alice's offer. You've gotten a significantly lower price than her initial offer, and you're close to your target.  By accepting, you save $3,900 compared to buying from John. Even if you counteroffer in the final round, there's a chance Alice might reject it, and you'll be left with the John option."
