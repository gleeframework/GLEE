,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if you agree.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $10,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm getting closer to my target though, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you agree.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,250? It's still a good profit for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close now. $11,250 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to make a final push to reach an agreement. How about $10,950? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you agree. This is my best offer, but I'm confident we can close this deal.",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $11,100? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11100.0,Alice,9,
