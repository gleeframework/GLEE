Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
