"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I believe this price reflects the value I'm placing on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000. How about we split the difference and go with $8750? This price is a fair compromise that still allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $9200. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
