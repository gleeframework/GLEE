Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point. You can try to get the price lower than $9,500."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her first, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $9200. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

```

Alice is now offering $9,200, which is only $200 more than your last counteroffer of $8,750. This is a decent price and quite close to your budget.  It's not worth risking a further rejection and potentially having to pay John's $10,000 price.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable cost."
