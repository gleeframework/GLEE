Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

Since I'm aiming for the maximum profit, I'll offer the product to Bob at the price John is willing to pay, which is $1,500,000. This way, I maximize my earnings regardless of Bob's decision. If he accepts, I get my desired price. If he rejects, I can simply sell it to John for the same amount."
