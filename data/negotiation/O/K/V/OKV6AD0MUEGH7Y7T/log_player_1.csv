Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he values the product at $12,000, but it also allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where we can both walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price slightly to 11200. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell the product for a higher price, Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's a better deal than selling to John for $10,000."
