"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that the negotiations could drag on and Alice might not budge further. Given the opportunity to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, Bob should take that option. It's the best deal he can get and guarantees the product without the risk of further negotiation."
