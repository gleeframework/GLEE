``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below your minimum of $12,000. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring you get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you want to get a fair price, but $9,250 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal price point. I believe I can push for a higher price."
