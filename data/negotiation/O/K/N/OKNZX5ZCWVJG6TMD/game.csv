"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $78? It's a good compromise, and we can both be happy.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $82 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your compromise at $78. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $80.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",80.5,Alice,5,
