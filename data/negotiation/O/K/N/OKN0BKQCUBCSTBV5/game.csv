"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you want to maximize your profit, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
