"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $1250000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident that it reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1290000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
