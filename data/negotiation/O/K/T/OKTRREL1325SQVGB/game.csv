,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000. It's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it would be a good way to close the deal.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's make this happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's the best I can do at this point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're holding firm at $1,250,000.  I'm willing to come down one last time to $1,262,500. This is a very fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. I truly believe this is the best option for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1262500.0,Alice,7,
