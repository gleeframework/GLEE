"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation, and is within your budget. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in accepting this offer as it's still above her own valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92 is higher than your initial counteroffer and is getting closer to your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that further rounds will result in a price closer to $100. Since John is willing to sell at $100, it's more efficient to simply buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
