"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to buy the product and save as much money as possible, and both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You'll get the product at the same price but might be able to build a relationship with Alice for future potential deals."
