{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential negotiation. It also frames the product as valuable and tailored to Bob's needs, aiming to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than your absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and meet at $16,000? This is a unique opportunity, and I believe you'll find it worthwhile at this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and selling to John for $15,000 would only yield a slightly better result.  This offer represents a fair compromise and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
