You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
