"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'd like to make you a one-time offer to buy it from me for $9,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value you place on it, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I'll need to sell it for at least $8,500. This is my final offer for now. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? That seems like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $7,750. I can do $8,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
