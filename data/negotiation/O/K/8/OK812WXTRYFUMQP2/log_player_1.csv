"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'd like to make you a one-time offer to buy it from me for $9,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value you place on it, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
