"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $800,000, meaning a deal can likely be reached somewhere between those two numbers. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $950,000 but still offers Alice a profit of $50,000 over her valuation. It shows Bob is serious about getting a good price, but also acknowledges the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good price, considering she rejected Bob's counteroffer of $850,000. It's still significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000, making it a worthwhile deal for Bob.  While there might be room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and ultimately choosing to deal with John is too high."
