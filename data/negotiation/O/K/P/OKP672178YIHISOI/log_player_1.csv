{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least that much to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $18,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $14,000, it's less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still willing to negotiate, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $16,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather not risk losing the sale completely, especially since John is also offering $15,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
