"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $18,000 to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still willing to negotiate, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $16,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",15500.0,Bob,4,
