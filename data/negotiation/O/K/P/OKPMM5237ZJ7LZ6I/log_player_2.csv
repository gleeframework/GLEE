"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $800000 to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my original offer.  How about $880000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price point. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation. Bob should counteroffer Alice again and try to get closer to his target price."
