Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You're still getting a significant return and can adjust the price based on Bob's response.
* **It's a clear signal of your willingness to negotiate:** You're not starting at your absolute top price, showing flexibility. 

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, but you also want to keep Bob engaged and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable paying $900000.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer you $850000. This seems fair considering your asking price and the value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Selling to John would guarantee you a much higher profit.  You have room to negotiate with Bob, but it's important to maintain your position and demonstrate your commitment to getting a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my original offer.  How about $880,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows you are willing to compromise but still maintains your position above Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Reasoning:** You provide a clear reason for your counteroffer, emphasizing the value for Bob and your need to approach your desired price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** You phrase the message to encourage further discussion and potential agreement.

This approach aims to balance your need for a good price with the desire to maintain a positive relationship with Bob and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $880000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $860000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $860,000 is a good price and a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  John offers a guaranteed profit that far surpasses the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob. 

At this point, it's wiser to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk a prolonged negotiation with Bob that might ultimately lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown in negotiations."
