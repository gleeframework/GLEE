"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this fantastic product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit higher than I had in mind. Would you be open to negotiating a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer and for meeting me halfway.  How about we try to split the difference again and settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair price to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
