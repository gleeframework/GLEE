"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is a fair price given my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's an increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value than before, it's still a bit below. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a bit higher in the next round. However, I am aware that I only have 4 rounds left, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll likely sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll accept $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
