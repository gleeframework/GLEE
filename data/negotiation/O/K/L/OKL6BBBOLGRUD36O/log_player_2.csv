"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far beyond Bob's budget of $800,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget of $800,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to his limit. There's still room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This offer takes into account your valuation while ensuring the deal remains worthwhile for me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. While there's a chance Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of the price not coming down further and missing out on a better deal with John is too high. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at his maximum budget with John."
