"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product.  While I cannot disclose the specific details just yet, I can assure you it's worth well over $1000000 to me.  I'm confident you'll find it equally compelling.  My initial price is $1500000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1200000 is simply too low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
