Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $8,500? That's a significant discount from my initial price and still allows you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to her price than John's. Let's try to nudge her a bit closer to $8,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $8,250?  That's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to come down much further.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $8,000. We've spent enough time negotiating, and getting the product sooner is valuable too."
