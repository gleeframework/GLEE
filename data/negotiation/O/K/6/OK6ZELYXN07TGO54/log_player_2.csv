"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value of the product ($800,000).  As Bob, I have a lot of room to negotiate and can try to get a much better price.  It's also worth noting that buying from John is a last resort option, and we have 10 rounds to try to reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than her own value of the product.  As Bob, I can still negotiate for a lower price.  While $1,000,000 is a significant improvement over her initial offer, I'm confident I can get it lower, especially since I have 7 more rounds to negotiate.  Buying from John is still a last resort option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is getting close to my counteroffer of $950,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, we are nearing the halfway point of our rounds and I want to avoid the risk of running out of time. It's also important to consider that buying from John for $1,500,000 is a much worse deal.  Accepting Alice's offer is a good compromise that ensures I get the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
