"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset for your business.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to acquire the product at a price that fits my financial plan.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I've reviewed our previous discussions and believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs and allows us to move forward with this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
