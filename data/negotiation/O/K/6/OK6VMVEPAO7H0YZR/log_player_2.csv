(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it's a fair compromise.
