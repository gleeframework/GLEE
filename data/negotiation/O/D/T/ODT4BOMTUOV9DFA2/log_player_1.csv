Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $120 to Bob, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $110. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm countering with a price of $115. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it seems likely that we're too far apart.  I'm going to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a good outcome for me."
