"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
