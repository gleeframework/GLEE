We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly engaged in negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly trying to find a middle ground and is steadily increasing his offer. Accepting at $880,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
