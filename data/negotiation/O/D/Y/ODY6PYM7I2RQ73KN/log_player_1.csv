"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 to ensure it fits within my budget. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is really my bottom line to make this worthwhile.  I could potentially come down to $13,000, but that's absolutely as low as I can go. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $10,000 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer.  It's time to move on to John who is ready to pay the desired price."
