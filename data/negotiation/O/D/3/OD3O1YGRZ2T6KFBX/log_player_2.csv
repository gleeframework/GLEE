"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. I believe this product has tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's ample room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is still a considerable amount for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point. This product has incredible value, and I believe it has the potential to generate significantly more revenue for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1250000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still higher than my desired price. I can still try to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm confident that this product will be beneficial for me, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a mutually beneficial solution that allows us to complete the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1100000 still isn't quite where I need to be. This product is truly unique and has the potential to be a game-changer for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1150000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal and make it a success for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within my budget and is getting closer to my desired price. It's getting close to my max budget, but it's still cheaper than buying from John, and I have more room for negotiation if I need it.  Therefore, it's better to accept this offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of a deal falling through."
