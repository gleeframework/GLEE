,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
