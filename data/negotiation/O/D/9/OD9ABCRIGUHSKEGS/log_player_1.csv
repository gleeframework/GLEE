# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my assessment, I am not willing to pay $2000000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to my valuation of $1500000? I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
