Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000 offer:** This is a good starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for Bob.
* **Friendly message:**  It's important to keep the tone friendly and encouraging. 
* **Focus on the value for Bob:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect can encourage him to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly lower price, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* **Encourage counteroffers:** If he rejects, it's likely he'll make a counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate towards a mutually acceptable price.

I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls or doesn't yield a satisfactory result. This gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to even consider at this stage. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my bargaining power:**  Accepting such a low offer would weaken my position in future negotiations.
* **Initiate a counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that is more aligned with my desired price point.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** This keeps the dialogue open and shows Bob I'm serious about selling the product, but not at a significantly discounted price.

I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and if not, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $850,000:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but considerably lower than my initial offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning and Value:** I emphasize the value of the product and highlight that this price is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Agreement:** I reiterate my desire to reach an agreement, suggesting a willingness to compromise further if needed. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating my willingness to negotiate increases the likelihood of a successful deal.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** By offering a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation going and create the opportunity for Bob to come closer to my desired price.

I'm ready to adjust my offer again if needed, but I'm determined to get a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,200,000, it's a good deal considering Bob's limited willingness to go higher.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** $825,000 is a significant profit, especially considering Bob's initial low offer.
* **Avoid risks:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal without the uncertainty of further rounds.
* **Time is money:** Prolonging the negotiation could be costly. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower offer.

While selling to John for $1,200,000 is ideal, securing $825,000 with Bob is a solid outcome that minimizes risk and maximizes potential profit in the given circumstances."
