"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit below my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would represent a significant movement on my part while still acknowledging the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
