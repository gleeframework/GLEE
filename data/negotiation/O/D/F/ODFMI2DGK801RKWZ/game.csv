"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $1400000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1400000 is a good offer, it falls slightly short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1450000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I've reviewed your latest offer of $1450000, and while it's a reasonable compromise, I still feel that $1400000 would be a more equitable price for both parties. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
