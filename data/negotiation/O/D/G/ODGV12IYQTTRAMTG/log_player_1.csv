Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  Here's why:

* **It's a good starting point:** $12,000 is significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still less than what you need to get from another buyer. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's room to go up or down depending on Bob's response and how much you want to prioritize selling to him versus selling to John.
* **It's a friendly opening:** The message is positive and suggests you are willing to work with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Your time:** How quickly do you need to sell the product? If time is of the essence, you might want to be more aggressive in your pricing.
* **Your relationship with Bob:** Do you have a pre-existing relationship with Bob? If so, you might be able to negotiate more aggressively.
* **Bob's negotiating style:**  How likely is he to counter-offer? How determined is he to get the product? 

By monitoring these factors and adjusting your offers, you can maximize your chances of getting the best price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it's still significantly less than what you need to get. It's worth trying to push for a higher price.  

You have a few options for your counteroffer:

* **Compromise:**  Offer a price slightly lower than your initial offer, perhaps $11,000. 
* **Stronger Stand:**  Hold firm at your initial $12,000 and see if Bob is willing to budge.
* **Counter-counter-offer:**  Counter Bob's offer with $10,000, meeting him halfway.

The best approach depends on your assessment of Bob's willingness to negotiate. If you think he's likely to walk away, a compromise might be wise. But if you think he's serious about getting the product, you can try to hold your ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great price for you, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **Compromise:** It meets Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:** $10,000 is still above the product's value to Bob, but it's closer to his offer, making him more likely to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on making the deal work, keeping the negotiation positive. 

By offering a counteroffer that's both reasonable and shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, you increase your chances of getting a better price while also keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've reviewed it again and am willing to increase my offer to $9,500. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:**  $9,500 is only $500 away from your minimum acceptable price of $9,000.
* **Limited upside:**  You've already lowered your price twice.  Pushing for a higher price risks losing the sale entirely.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale without further negotiation.

While it's tempting to try for a higher price, considering the risk of losing the sale to John,  accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision."
