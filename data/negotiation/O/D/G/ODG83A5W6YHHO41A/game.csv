"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product. I'm hoping we can close the deal on this round.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
