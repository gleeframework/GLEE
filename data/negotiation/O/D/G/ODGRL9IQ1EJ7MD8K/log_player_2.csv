"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a great asset. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation.  You might be able to get a better price by rejecting her initial offer."
