"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we settle at $650,000? That would work for me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $650,000 just isn't feasible for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and agree on $725,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",725000.0,Alice,5,
