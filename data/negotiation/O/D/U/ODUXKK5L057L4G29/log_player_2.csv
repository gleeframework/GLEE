# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth, I'm extending an exclusive offer to you at $120. This price not only reflects the product's value but also provides you with an excellent opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You can get the product from John for $150, which is within your budget. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
