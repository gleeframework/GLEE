,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. My next offer is $920,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $920,000 is still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $860,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $860,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next offer is $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",880000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $880,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one last concession. My next offer is $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",915000.0,Alice,9,
