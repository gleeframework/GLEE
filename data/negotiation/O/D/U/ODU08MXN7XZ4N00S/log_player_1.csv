Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation, giving him an incentive to potentially accept. However, it also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While it's tempting to accept and get a quick sale, it's too low of a price. I'm not willing to sell for such a loss.  

I will counteroffer to find a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
