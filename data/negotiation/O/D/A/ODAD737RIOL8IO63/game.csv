"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's value to me is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on price. However,  $1,750,000 is still higher than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
