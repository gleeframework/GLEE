"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to go down to $7,200?"", ""product_price"": 7200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit closer to $7,000, but I'm still trying to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $7,350. It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,350 is still lower than John's price of $8,000, and it's a reasonable compromise after her previous rejection. Bob has already made his counteroffer and there's no guarantee of further negotiation success. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of further rounds."
