{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts by building rapport and expressing confidence in the product's value for Bob. The price is set at $9,500, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to his own value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,150. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $8,900. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,900 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe there's a good chance of getting a better price in future rounds, but the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is too high for me.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000 to guarantee my desired profit."
