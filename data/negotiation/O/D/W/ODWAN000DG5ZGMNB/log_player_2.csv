"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,350,000 is lower than your maximum price, there's room to negotiate. Alice seems eager to sell and mentioning ""other interested parties"" might be a tactic. By rejecting, you could potentially get a better offer from Alice or still buy it from John for $1,500,000."
