"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. While your price is attractive, I'm aiming to keep my investment below $700,000. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $680,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. ",680000.0,Bob,2,
