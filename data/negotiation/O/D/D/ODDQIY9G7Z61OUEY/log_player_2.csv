"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal from Alice."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly willing to bargain, so continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and my bottom line. How about we meet at $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer is $14,000, which is the same as her initial offer. It seems she's not willing to budge further.  Bob has already rejected this price once and made a counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate will likely lead to a long and frustrating back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better deal.

Given that John is offering the product for $15,000, it's more efficient for Bob to simply buy from John and avoid the potential for a stalemate with Alice."
