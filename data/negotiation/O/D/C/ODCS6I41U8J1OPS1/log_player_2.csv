"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, so you can definitely do better than $120. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
