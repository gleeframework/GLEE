"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1000000. This allows you a substantial profit, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with. Please consider this offer carefully. I'm confident you won't regret it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
