"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $6,500.  Would that be feasible?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $7,000. That's a pretty good offer considering I can buy it from John for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you can purchase it from John for $8,000. Let's close this deal.",7500.0,Alice,7,
