"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see where you're coming from, but the product's quality and potential are worth a premium.  Would you consider $15,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
