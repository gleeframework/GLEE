"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I'm interested, $800000 is a bit outside my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable at $650000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly. What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
