Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I'm interested, $800,000 is a bit outside my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation and shows that you are serious about buying the product but are also mindful of your budget."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable at $650,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing flexibility. It's still below Alice's offer but indicates you're getting closer to a possible agreement. You're also emphasizing a sense of urgency and fairness, making a deal more likely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is very close to your ideal price point. Considering the limited rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing the price higher outweighs the potential benefit of a lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures you get a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product."
