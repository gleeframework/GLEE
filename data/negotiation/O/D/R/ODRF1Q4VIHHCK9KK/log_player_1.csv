"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm going to start with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still less than what I'd ideally want.  I'm going to reject and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully close enough to Bob's desired price to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but it still keeps the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's getting a little frustrating.  I'm not sure if we'll be able to close the deal at a price I'm happy with. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal profit, but it's a safe and sure deal."
