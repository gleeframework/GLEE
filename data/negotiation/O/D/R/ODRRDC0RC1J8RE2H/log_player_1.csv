Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves a considerable margin for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a price closer to $900,000, and I think with a little more negotiation I can get there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $887,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us and keep the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit away from $887,500. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'd like to make a deal, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer from Bob is very close to what I was hoping for.  I'm going to accept it and sell the product to Bob for $882,500. This is a good deal for me, and it's worth taking the deal now rather than risking losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price."
