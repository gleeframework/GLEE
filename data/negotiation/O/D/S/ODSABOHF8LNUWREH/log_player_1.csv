Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still working within a strict budget. I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is getting close to my desired range, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether. Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a sale quickly."
