"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. While I'm happy to provide you with more information, I'm confident in its worth and believe it will be worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount considering its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is also very interested.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
