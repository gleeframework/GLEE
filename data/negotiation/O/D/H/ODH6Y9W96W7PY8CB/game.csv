,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to go a little higher, but $107.50 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we settle on $106?",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about $107?",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $108, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $109 to break even.",109.0,Alice,7,
