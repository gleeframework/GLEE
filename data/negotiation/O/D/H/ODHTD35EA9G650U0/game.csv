"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $8000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $7500 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that price.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8250 is getting closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  Would you consider a final price of $8000?  That's my absolute maximum, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
