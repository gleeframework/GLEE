"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is well above my budget. I'm happy to consider a price closer to $10,000.  This feels like a fair starting point given the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows me to make a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?  This would give us both a good deal and keep the negotiation moving forward.",14000.0,Bob,4,
