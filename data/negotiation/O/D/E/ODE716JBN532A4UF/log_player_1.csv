"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my maximum price, $1,200,000, to see if Bob is willing to meet my valuation. This gives me the best chance to maximize my profit while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to take $950,000, it's still a loss for me.  I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John for a guaranteed profit. I will counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. It shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're halfway through the rounds. I need to keep negotiating to try and get closer to my desired price. While selling to John is always an option, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit. $1,050,000 is a good compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer while still giving me a profit. It shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but also that I won't settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the rounds. However, I'm not willing to sell for a significant loss. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can find a compromise. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll sell to John and guarantee a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would prefer to reach an agreement with Bob, I need to ensure I make a profit. John's offer guarantees me my desired outcome."
