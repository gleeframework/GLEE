Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and appear flexible. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will tell you a lot about how badly he wants the product and his potential willingness to pay more than $8,000. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you have John as a backup who's willing to pay $12,000. This knowledge gives you leverage to walk away from a deal with Bob if it's not beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob offered $10,000, which is $2,000 more than he values the product. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting $10,000 would mean losing out on the $12,000 John is guaranteed to pay.
* **Aiming Higher:** It's worth trying to negotiate a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value to me is considerably higher. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer aims for a price closer to the middle ground between Bob's offer ($10,000) and your desired price ($15,000) but slightly favoring you.
* **Testing the Waters:** By countering with $13,000, you're gauging how much further Bob is willing to go. His response will determine your next move.
* **John as Leverage:** You still have the option to walk away and sell to John for $12,000, giving you negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still working within my budget and would like to propose an offer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches the price John is willing to pay. This means you're getting your minimum acceptable price.
* **No Guarantee of More:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better offer from Bob. He might not be willing to go any higher.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the sale."
