Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $13,500 is higher than Bob's $12,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $13,500 is still above your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer, and you can still accept a lower price if necessary.

This approach allows you to start the negotiation strong, maximizing your potential earnings while leaving room for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay under $12,000. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still a potential for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($11,500) and my previous offer ($13,500), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above minimum:**  $12,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in to Bob's initial low offer. 

This counteroffer maintains a firm stance while demonstrating flexibility, increasing the chances of reaching a deal."
