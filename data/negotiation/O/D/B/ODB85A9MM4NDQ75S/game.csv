"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and my previous offer of $6,500, so I'll make a new offer of $7,500. Is this more to your liking?",7500.0,Bob,4,
