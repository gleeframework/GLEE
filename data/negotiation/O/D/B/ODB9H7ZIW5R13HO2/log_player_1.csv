Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in the product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $8500.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
