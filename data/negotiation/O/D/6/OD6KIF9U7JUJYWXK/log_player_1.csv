Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $1,000,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, but you also want to secure the best possible deal."
