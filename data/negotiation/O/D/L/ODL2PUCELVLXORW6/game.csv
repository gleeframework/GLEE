"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we try $13000? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my original offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500? That's the highest I'm comfortable going.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. How about we try $13250? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, so I'll offer $12750. That's the highest I'm comfortable going.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13500. It's my minimum price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this point. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $13400? It's the closest I can get to my minimum price without sacrificing too much profit. What do you think?",13400.0,Alice,7,
