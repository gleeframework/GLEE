**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer and gives us room to negotiate. It's important to start with a bold move to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still too high, but it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,150,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still trying to save as much money as possible."
