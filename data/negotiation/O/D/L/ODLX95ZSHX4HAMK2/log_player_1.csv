Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm going to counter his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves me with a significant profit.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
