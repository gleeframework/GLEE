"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $10750 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a more substantial increase from your end. I'm counteroffering at $12200.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'm counteroffering at $12375. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",12375.0,Alice,9,
