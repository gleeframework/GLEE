"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $135. It's worth $120 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $150. A counteroffer will likely get you a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice has come down to $130, which is still a good deal for you considering you're willing to pay $150.  Accepting her offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
