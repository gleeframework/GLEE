Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $135 is more than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $150, allowing for potential compromise.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value the product. 

This strategy aims to secure a fair price while also keeping the negotiation open for potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $135 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at your minimum:** While $125 is acceptable, it doesn't leave any room for profit beyond your bare minimum. 
* **You can try for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price. You know Bob is interested and has already shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can sell to John for $120 provides a safety net in case you can't reach a better deal with Bob.

**Next Step:** 

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer in the next round. Consider aiming for something slightly higher than $125 to see if you can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  This counteroffer increases your price by $5, bringing it closer to your desired price while still being within a reasonable range.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By lowering your price, you show flexibility and your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  You reiterate the product's value, hoping Bob will recognize its worth and be more inclined to accept.

This approach balances the need to secure a decent price with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
