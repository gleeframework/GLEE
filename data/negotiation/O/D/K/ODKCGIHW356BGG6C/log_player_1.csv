Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I think I can still do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum,  $875,000 is still below my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer and see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, it's better to secure a sale now than risk getting nothing at all."
