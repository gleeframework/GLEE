Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 provides some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, potentially persuading Bob to consider the offer.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy accordingly. If he seems hesitant or unwilling to negotiate near your asking price, accepting John's offer is the best way to maximize your profit."
