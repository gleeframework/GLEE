Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but even a dollar above your minimum ($120) is profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John provides leverage. You don't need to drastically lower the price for Bob.

**Important Note:** This assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew you had a guaranteed buyer at $120, he'd be less likely to offer more than that."
