"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive but not the best possible deal.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is a good starting point but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation.** By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can guide the price down further.
* **Buying from John is not a viable option right now.** While John's price is your absolute maximum, it's always better to try and get a lower price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price but still leaves room for negotiation.**  $950,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it down further.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps you in control of the negotiation.** You can continue to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is not a good option yet.** You're still within a reasonable range with Alice, and there's potential to save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $925,000 for the product. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  $975,000 is only $50,000 higher than your last counteroffer, and you're likely not going to get much lower.
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer.**  Continuing to reject offers could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away.
* **Buying from John is a worse deal.** You're currently closer to your desired price with Alice, and risking a stalemate with her could mean you have to pay John's full price. 

**It's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price.**"
