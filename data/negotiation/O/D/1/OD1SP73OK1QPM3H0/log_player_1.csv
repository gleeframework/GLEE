Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he may be willing to pay a premium for it if he perceives it as valuable or if it solves a significant need. 
* **Below John's Offer:** This offer ensures that if Bob rejects, you're still getting a great deal from John.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. He may try to bring the price down closer to his perceived value."
