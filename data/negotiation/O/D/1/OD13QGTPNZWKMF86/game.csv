"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
