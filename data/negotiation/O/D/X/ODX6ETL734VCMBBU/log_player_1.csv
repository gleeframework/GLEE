Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You are still making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** This incentivizes him to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if needed.

By offering a price that is in the middle ground, you're showing Bob that you are willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution. You also have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, you can still do better. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,225,000?  This would still represent a significant savings for you compared to the product's true value and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's a small step back from your initial offer:** You're showing flexibility while still holding firm on your desired price range.
* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway, increasing the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **It still leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price further if needed. 

By offering a slightly lower price, you are showing Bob that you are serious about striking a deal.  At the same time, it is still within your acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your initial asking price, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has repeated his offer of $1,200,000, which is a good price. While you might be able to get a slightly higher offer by continuing the negotiation, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. It's also possible that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, allowing you to move on to other opportunities."
