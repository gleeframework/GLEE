"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your company. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,225,000?  This would still represent a significant savings for you compared to the product's true value and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
