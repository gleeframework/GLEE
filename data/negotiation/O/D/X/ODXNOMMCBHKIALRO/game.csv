"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go as high as $1,050,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,150,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to your offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,120,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. ",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,115,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
