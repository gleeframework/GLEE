Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $11,500 is the best move. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $11,500 is still a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has uncertain outcomes. Bob might walk away, forcing you to settle for John's offer of $12,000.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows you to move on to other opportunities.
