"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,5,
