I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This gives me a good starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I want to give Bob the opportunity to buy first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,600,000. This is a smaller reduction than before, showing Bob that I'm getting closer to a price we might both be happy with. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to come down a bit more to see if we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not coming close to my minimum acceptable price.  I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm getting tired of going back and forth. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than giving the product away for a price that's significantly below its value."
