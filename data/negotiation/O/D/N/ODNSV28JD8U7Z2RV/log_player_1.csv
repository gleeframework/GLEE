Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a significant profit.  It also opens the conversation with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my target.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round. I want to maximize my profit and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I still think I can do better. How about $9,800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is tempting, it's still not close enough to my target.  I'm going to counter again and try to push for a higher price. There's still time to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference this time?  $10,150.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to counter again.  The product is worth a lot to Bob, and I'm confident I can get him to pay closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're close! I'm willing to come down to $9,800.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other buyers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $9,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting a little nervous about the number of rounds left,  $9,600 is still too low for me. The product is worth significantly more to Bob, and I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter one more time before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $9,600 just isn't enough.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to pay $8,000 right now.  If you're serious about getting this product,  I'm willing to go to $9,700. This is my final offer,  and I'll need an answer quickly."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,700 and my original offer of $9,000. How about $9,350? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only one round remaining and Bob's offer still below my target, I have to consider selling to John.  Although I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I've reached the end of my negotiation window, and selling to John guarantees I get a price above my minimum. It's better to secure a decent profit than to risk getting nothing."
