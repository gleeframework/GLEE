The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110. I can get it for $100 from John, so I will reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy it for $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $107.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $107.50 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Since I can get it from John for $100, I'll go with that option."
