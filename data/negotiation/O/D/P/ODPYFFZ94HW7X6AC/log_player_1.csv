Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product can do. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential of this product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

Bob is moving closer to our target price and $875,000 is a significant profit. It's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer further or walking away in later rounds."
