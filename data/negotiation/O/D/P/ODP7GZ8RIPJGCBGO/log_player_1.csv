{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd like to close the deal with Bob, accepting his offer would be a big loss for me.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer will ensure a sale and allow me to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
