"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation below your $1,500,000 maximum. By rejecting, you signal that the price is too steep and encourage her to come down significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

This counteroffer:

* **Anchors low:**  It establishes a much lower price point, aiming to shift the negotiation in your favor.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While significantly below Alice's opening, it allows for some back-and-forth without immediately hitting a stalemate.
* **Conveys seriousness:**  The specific number suggests a considered offer rather than a random lowball.

This strategy aims to see if Alice is willing to drop her price significantly or if she's firmly set near her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice lowered her price, it's still above the midpoint between your initial offer and her initial asking price. This indicates there might be room for further negotiation. Rejecting again maintains pressure and lets her know you're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of the current negotiating range ($1,100,000 - $1,300,000). This common tactic can signal fairness and willingness to compromise. 
* **Approaching Your Limit:**  You're nearing your maximum budget, so further concessions should be smaller. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This offer will reveal if Alice is truly willing to move substantially from her last offer or if she's holding firm closer to $1,300,000."
