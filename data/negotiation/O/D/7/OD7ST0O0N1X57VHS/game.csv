"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your company. I'm asking for $950,000, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from this product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we try $760,000? This offer represents a significant investment from my side, while still acknowledging the value of your product.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $760,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at $800,000 to make this deal work. I understand we both have our limits, but this is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the potential value you'll gain.",800000.0,Alice,5,
