Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price of $1,000,000. This ensures I get the maximum value for my product while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that John will buy it for this price if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more while still remaining close to my ideal price. I'm confident this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider without jeopardizing my own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is closer to my desired price point and is higher than my minimum of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to sell for $950,000 or more, I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful transaction, which is my primary objective."
