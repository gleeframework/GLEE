"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
