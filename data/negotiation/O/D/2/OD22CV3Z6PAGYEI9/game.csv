"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $70 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $75? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",75.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could do $72, but that's really stretching my budget.",72.0,Bob,6,
