"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's a chance you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower offer (7000) is a good strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a significant discount from the initial price, making it clear that you are serious about negotiating. If Alice rejects, you can adjust your counteroffer based on her response in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price, which is not ideal. However,  rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going. This allows you to continue exploring if Alice is willing to come down in price or if you should consider the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice raised her price, but it's still within your budget.  A counteroffer of $7500 represents a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages Alice to meet you halfway.  If she rejects, you can still consider buying from John, but this counteroffer is a good attempt to keep the negotiation alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price again, making her offer far less attractive. It's clear she's not willing to negotiate towards a price you find reasonable.  At this point, buying from John for $8,000 is the best option, as it ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you further time and potential frustration with Alice."
