,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $110. Let's find a way to make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $120 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a steal at that price. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
