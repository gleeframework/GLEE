"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Openness:** I'm indicating willingness to negotiate, but not giving away my bottom line.

This strategy aims to:

* Get Bob thinking about the value of the product and its potential to him.
* Create an initial negotiating point that gives me room to move down in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob acknowledges the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Time to counter:**  I have more rounds available, and I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation and try to reach a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which still gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm counteroffering with $14,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm still keeping the communication friendly and open to negotiation.
* **Highlight the value:**  I remind Bob that $14,000 is still a good deal considering the product's value.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but not at a price that significantly undermines my minimum value.
* Keep the negotiations moving forward toward a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $13,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is key:**  I have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better offer.
* **Not ready to settle:**  I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired value.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price that's closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $13,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is the midpoint between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000).
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer is a compromise that considers both our needs. 
* **Staying firm on value:** While I'm willing to move closer to Bob's price, I'm not going below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
*  Keep the negotiations moving forward and hopefully reach a final agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I've been thinking about it and would like to propose $13,000 for the product. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited.
* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a secure option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation risk.

While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Therefore, to ensure I receive my desired value, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000."
