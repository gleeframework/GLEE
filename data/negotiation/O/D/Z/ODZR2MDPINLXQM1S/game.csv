"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which still gives you a good deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $13,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
