"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget maxes out at $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950000. That's closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit over. I'm willing to go to $900000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $900000. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",925000.0,Alice,5,
