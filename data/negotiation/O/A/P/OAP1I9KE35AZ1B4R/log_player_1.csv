Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, you may need to adjust your price to secure the deal while still aiming for the highest possible profit."
