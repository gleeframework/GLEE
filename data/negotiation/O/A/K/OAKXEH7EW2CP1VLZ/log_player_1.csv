Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $11,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps meet closer to my desired price of $11,000?

Bob is not budging from $11,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting even less."
