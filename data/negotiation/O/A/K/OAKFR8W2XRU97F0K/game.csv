"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's true value.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to close the deal at this price.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,800 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $10,000 even? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
