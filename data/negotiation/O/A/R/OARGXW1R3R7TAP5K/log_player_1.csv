Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still getting a significantly better price than John's offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that is highly profitable for Alice while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
