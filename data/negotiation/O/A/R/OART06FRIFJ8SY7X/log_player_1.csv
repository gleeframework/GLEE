I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $120 is still below my minimum, but I'll see if I can negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $125?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4

I'm still not comfortable with $115.  It's too close to my minimum, and I'm hoping to get closer to $125. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $115 is really pushing it for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 6

While $118 is still below my ideal, it's very close to my minimum and Bob has signaled that this is his final offer. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for $100."
