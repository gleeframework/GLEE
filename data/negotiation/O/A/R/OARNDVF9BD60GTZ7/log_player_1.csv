Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. Here's my initial offer:

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a significant amount. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Let's see what he thinks!
