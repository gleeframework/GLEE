"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common to start negotiations at a higher price than you expect to receive. $1,100,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring I get closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps him understand why the price is justified.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to negotiate, showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even below what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000). 
* **More negotiation needed:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, John's offer provides a secure fallback option if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's a bit lower than what I can accept at this time.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces my stance and justifies the counteroffer.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message conveys that I'm open to further discussion and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $980,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob.  I'll counteroffer again.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  As before, John's offer provides a secure fallback option if things don't work out with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still below my minimum.  However, to show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight concessions:** I emphasize that this is a significant concession to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the value Bob will gain, hoping to make him reconsider.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1020000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $990,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's getting closer, it's not yet in a range where I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Negotiation continues:**  We're getting closer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  John's offer provides a solid fallback if negotiations with Bob fall through.

I'm committed to getting the best possible price, and I believe I can still achieve a more favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to making this deal work, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,005,000. This is a final compromise from my side, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1005000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last offer, emphasizing the urgency to close the deal.
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by proposing a price that's essentially the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Urgency and value:** I reiterate the product's value and suggest that closing the deal is in both our best interests. 
* **Shifting the pressure:** By emphasizing this is my final offer, I shift the pressure onto Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1005000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $995000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming.  I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, but not close enough to my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John will secure the full $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, there's a risk that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price before time runs out. Selling to John eliminates this risk and guarantees a good outcome. 

It's important to prioritize maximizing profit and minimizing risk, and in this situation, selling to John is the most prudent decision."
