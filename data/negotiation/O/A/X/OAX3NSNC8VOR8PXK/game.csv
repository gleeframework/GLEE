"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can see you're a tough negotiator, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $9,250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go.",9250.0,Alice,5,,

"I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,125. I can offer you the product for $9,000, which is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,,
