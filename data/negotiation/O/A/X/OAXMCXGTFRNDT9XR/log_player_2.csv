"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer.  You have no information about Alice's bottom line, so there's a good chance you can get a better price.  Additionally, rejecting the offer opens the door for negotiation and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A 50% reduction is a substantial starting point, and it allows room for further negotiation if Alice counteroffers.  This approach aims to quickly establish a range for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my initial target, but still higher than I'd like. There are still rounds left to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $700,000,  showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price below her last offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between our previous positions, and hopefully pushing us closer to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my current target.  I've already shown my willingness to negotiate and have established a range.  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $750,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, while still aiming for a price lower than her last offer.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap.  Hopefully, Alice will see the value in accepting this offer and avoiding further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer of $825,000 is within my acceptable range, especially considering the possibility of further negotiation.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product while still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance I might get a lower price if I continue negotiating, the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
