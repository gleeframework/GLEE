"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if necessary. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $800,000 as possible, while still leaving room for negotiation."
