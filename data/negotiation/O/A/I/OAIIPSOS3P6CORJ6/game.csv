"Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way, we're both getting closer to what we want.  Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,5,
