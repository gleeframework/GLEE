"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $6,500, we position ourselves closer to the middle ground between our ideal price ($8,000) and Alice's likely lower limit (somewhere above her value of $12,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** We don't want to lowball too much and risk offending Alice. This counteroffer shows we're serious but trying to find a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our price, but we can still try to push for a better deal. Her offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's $8,000. We'll make a counteroffer slightly below John's price to see if we can incentivize Alice to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $8,000.  I'd prefer to buy from you, but only if we can get closer to that price point. Would you consider $7,800?"", 
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Leverage:** We're being transparent with Alice about John's offer to create a sense of urgency and give her a reason to lower her price further. 
* **Slight Concession:** We're not completely lowballing her. Offering $7,800 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows we are willing to compromise, but not at the expense of losing money.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court. She can either accept a slightly lower profit margin or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you've found a similar product for $8,000, but mine is unique and offers additional value.  I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings with Continued Negotiation:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200. The potential savings of a few more dollars are outweighed by the risk of her refusing and us having to settle for John's offer anyway.
* **Good Deal Secured:** We've managed to negotiate the price down by $1,800 from Alice's initial offer. This is a significant saving and a good deal overall. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting this offer allows us to finalize the deal and move on."
