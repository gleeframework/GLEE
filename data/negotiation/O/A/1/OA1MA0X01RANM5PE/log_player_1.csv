Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's less than Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob and increases the likelihood of him accepting.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while leaving room for negotiation if necessary. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. It's important to remember that I have room to negotiate, and there's still potential to get closer to my ideal price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to hold out for a better offer.
* **Explore further options:** I can now counter with a higher price and potentially secure a more favorable deal.

I will proceed with a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,400,000.  Here's why:

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's price, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't settle for less than I'm comfortable with.
* **Room for adjustment:** This price leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects my offer again. 

I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between securing a reasonable price and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a tough one. It's just a bit more than what John is offering, but it's still below my desired price. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to minimum:** While not ideal, it's only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better price. Bob may be unwilling to budge further.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and move on. 

Weighing the pros and cons, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer. It's a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale at a price that's not too far below my minimum."
