"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is a high-quality item that has been valued at $120 by yourself, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth and benefits. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $120 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product immediately from John without any potential for haggling or risk of rejection."
