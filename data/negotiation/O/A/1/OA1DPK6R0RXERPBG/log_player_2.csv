"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price but still offers her a profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and Bob is demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a significant improvement over Alice's first offer, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $9,500. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,875.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still within Bob's budget and offers Alice a decent profit margin.  It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $9,875.  How about $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that $10,000 is her final offer. This price is still within Bob's budget and is closer to his desired price point.  While he could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential of losing the deal entirely."
