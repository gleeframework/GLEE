"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly above her own valuation of the product. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly below Alice's offer but still a comfortable margin above her valuation. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling our interest in a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, but it's still above the midpoint between our initial offers.  We have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,000,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're proposing a price that matches Alice's own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and it represents a significant saving for us compared to John's offer or her previous offer."
