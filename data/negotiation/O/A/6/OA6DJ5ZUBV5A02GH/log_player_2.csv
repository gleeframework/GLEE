"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save $100,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  While $1,100,000 is within your budget, there's still room for a better deal.  You have more leverage since you have an alternative option (John) at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  You're aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000, but you're not going too low to risk losing the deal entirely.  This counteroffer shows that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer means you save $25,000 compared to buying from John and $25,000 compared to your last counteroffer. While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for saving a little more money."
