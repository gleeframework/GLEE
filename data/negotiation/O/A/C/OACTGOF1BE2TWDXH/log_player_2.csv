"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if we can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still significantly above John's price. We should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I can do $700,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're now only $50,000 away from John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, potentially missing out on the deal altogether.  Buying from John guarantees the product at our target price."
