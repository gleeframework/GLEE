"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I can do $700,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
