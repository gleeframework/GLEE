"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. I believe this price is fair considering the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This price still reflects its value, but it's a bit more flexible than my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1300000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
