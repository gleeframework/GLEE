"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the discount. However, I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,320,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This price is fair, given the potential value it brings to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal here.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,290,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to seal the deal. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
