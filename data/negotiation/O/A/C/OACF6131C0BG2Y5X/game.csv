"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of the product's value, I understand your desire for a more favorable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant discount and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
