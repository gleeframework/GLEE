"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
