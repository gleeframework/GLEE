"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly unique and goes beyond the $900,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
