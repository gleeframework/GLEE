{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.  This price is high enough to potentially interest Bob, but still leaves room for me to bargain if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid potentially further negotiation, which could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.  $9,000 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to secure the sale with Bob."
