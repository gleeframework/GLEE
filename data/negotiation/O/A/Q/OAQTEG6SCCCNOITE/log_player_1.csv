Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000) aims to establish a strong anchor point. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable by comparison.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high initial price provides space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can gradually reduce the price while still aiming for a final sale price significantly above her minimum ($15,000).
* **Considering the backup offer:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge allows her to confidently set a higher price for Bob, understanding that she has a safety net. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice might adjust her approach in subsequent messages to maximize her profit."
