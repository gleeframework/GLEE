"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a value for the product, but I also have a minimum price I need to meet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my price range.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,250,000 is still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $1,275,000? This would give me a fair return and still offer you a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit below your latest offer. How about we try $1,225,000? I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
