Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the product's worth to me.

It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my price range."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,250,000 is still not quite there.

Bob is not budging much, and I'm worried I'm getting too close to my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
