Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500.  I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still a potential saving of $500 compared to your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is your initial offer, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, allowing for a potential agreement closer to your desired price."
