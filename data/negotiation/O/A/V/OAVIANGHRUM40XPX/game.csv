"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,000. I'm eager to close this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider.  To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
