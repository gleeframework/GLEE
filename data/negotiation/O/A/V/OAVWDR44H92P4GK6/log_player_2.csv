"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly willing to meet him halfway.  At $9,750, Bob is saving $2,250 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving.  There's a good chance he won't get a better price, and the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it."
