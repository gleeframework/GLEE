Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than your guaranteed minimum from John, leaving room for negotiation with Bob while still providing a substantial profit for you.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Than Minimum:** Offering $1,500,000 is a good starting point because it's a clear signal that you value the product and are not desperate to sell.
* **Potential For Negotiation:** This price allows for negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.
* **Risk Management:** If Bob rejects, you're still guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, minimizing your potential loss. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. You can adjust the price depending on your assessment of Bob's potential willingness to pay, his negotiation style, and your own risk tolerance."
