"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $130.  I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for a product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  This product is really worth a lot more. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. Could we do it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While negotiating with Bob might eventually lead to a sale, it's unlikely he'll reach the $100 mark. John offers a guaranteed $100, which matches the product's minimum value to me. It makes more sense to take the sure deal with John at this point."
