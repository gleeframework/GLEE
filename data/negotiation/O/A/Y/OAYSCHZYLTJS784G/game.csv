"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I believe a mutually beneficial deal is within reach.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
