Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $10,000 for the product. Would you consider this amount as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his $10,000 offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. Accepting his offer is a significant loss, making selling to John for $15,000 the best decision at this point."
