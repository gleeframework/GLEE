Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can get you to come down.
* **Justification:** By saying ""I think it's worth a lot,"" you are subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind above the $120 he perceives. 
* **Politeness:**  Being polite and offering it to Bob ""first"" can encourage him to engage positively in the negotiation.

While you are guaranteed $120 from John, there's a chance Bob might accept your offer, earning you an extra $30 profit."
