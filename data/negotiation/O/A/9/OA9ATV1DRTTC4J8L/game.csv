"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am not able to meet the price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
