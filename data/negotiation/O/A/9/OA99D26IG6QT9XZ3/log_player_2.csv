"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though Alice's offer is $100,000 more than the product's worth to her, it's still $100,000 less than what you would pay John. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
