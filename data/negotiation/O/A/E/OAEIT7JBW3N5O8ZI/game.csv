"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,050,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm trying to make a smart business decision here.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a smart decision, and I appreciate you coming up on the price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,850,000? This represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the product's value will more than justify it in the long run.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Alice, but I still think $1,850,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,725,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
