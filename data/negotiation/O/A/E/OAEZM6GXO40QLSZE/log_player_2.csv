**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,050,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a good deal compared to the original offer, Bob has a better option: buying from John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees him the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
