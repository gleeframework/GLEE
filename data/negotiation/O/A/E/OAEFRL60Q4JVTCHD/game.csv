"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate you getting closer to my target price, but $9,900 still isn't quite there. How about we split the difference at $10,000?  It's a fair price and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,900 and $10,000. How about $9,950?",9950.0,Bob,8,
