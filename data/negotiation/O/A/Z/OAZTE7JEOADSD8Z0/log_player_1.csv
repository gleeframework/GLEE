Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a starting point that offers a significant discount to Bob, while still ensuring I receive a substantial amount for the product. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while giving me some room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also aware of John's offer, and I'm prepared to switch to him if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, but still aiming for a profit significantly higher than John's offer. I believe this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my desired profit.  Furthermore, it's a higher price than John's offer.  I believe it's best to accept and move on from this negotiation."
