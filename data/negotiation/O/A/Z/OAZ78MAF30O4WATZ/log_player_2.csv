Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! But I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about $105 again? I'm willing to stick with my previous offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price around $105.  We're still in early rounds and have room to negotiate. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're really sticking to that $105! I appreciate your position but I'm not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle at $98?"",
 ""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds. Offering a price that's a straight split of the difference shows we are serious about getting the deal done.
* **Maintain Pressure:** We don't want to jump up to her price, as it might signal we're willing to pay more. A smaller increase keeps the pressure on her to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We still have John's offer as a backup. If Alice is unwilling to budge, we can take John's offer without wasting more time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still talking, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway on the difference, but I think I can do better than $98. How about $99? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Great Price:** $99 is a fantastic price, well below John's offer and close to Alice's lowest acceptable point.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only one round left, the risk of Alice not budging further and us losing the deal outweighs the potential to save another dollar. 
* **Successful Negotiation:**  We successfully negotiated Alice down $11 from her original offer. Taking the deal now secures a good outcome."
