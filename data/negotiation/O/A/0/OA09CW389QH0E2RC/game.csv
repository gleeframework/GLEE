"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it can bring to your business is well worth it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,
