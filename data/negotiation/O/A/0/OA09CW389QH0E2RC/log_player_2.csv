"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it can bring to your business is well worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have no information about the value of the product to Alice. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price before buying from John at $1,000,000. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows your willingness to negotiate and gives you room to maneuver in future rounds. The message is respectful and acknowledges the product's value but emphasizes your budgetary constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired price point.  You still have room to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price. Meeting in the middle demonstrates your desire to reach an agreement. By proposing a price that's not too far off from Alice's last offer, it increases the chance of her accepting and getting a better price than your previous offer."
