"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1240000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.
