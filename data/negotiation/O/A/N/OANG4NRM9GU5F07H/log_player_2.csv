(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $180 is far above your budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** $160 is still above my budget, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this product for $140.  It's the most I can afford right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I need to make a profit. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $145 is closer to my budget, it's still a little too high.  Since John is offering the product for $100, it's a better deal for me and I don't want to risk further negotiations with Alice."
