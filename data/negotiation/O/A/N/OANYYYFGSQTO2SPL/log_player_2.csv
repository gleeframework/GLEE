"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my $10,000 limit.  There's a good chance I can get the product for less than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially stay under my $10,000 limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down this much, there's a good chance I can get a great deal. If not, I can adjust my offer in the next round. 
* **John as Backup:** I always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $10,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign, but $10,500 is still above my maximum budget.  I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm prepared to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I can go a bit higher, but $10,500 is a little too much for me. How about $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate by increasing my offer, but I'm keeping the increase relatively small ($750).
* **Staying Below Budget:**  This counteroffer keeps me well below my $10,000 limit.
* **Testing Flexibility:**  This offer will test whether Alice is truly willing to meet closer to my budget or if she's firmly above $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge below $10,000.  While I might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of her, it's not worth the risk of her walking away.  John's offer of $10,000 is guaranteed, and it keeps me within my budget. It's time to take the safe option."
