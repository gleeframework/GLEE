{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay but is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I can go a bit higher, but $10,500 is a little too much for me. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10125}
