"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  I can go a bit higher, but $10,500 is a little too much for me. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10125.0,Alice,5,
