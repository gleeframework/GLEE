"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is asking, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This initial counteroffer aims to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with and saves him $3,500 compared to buying from John."
