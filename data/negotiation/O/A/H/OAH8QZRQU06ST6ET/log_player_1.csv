Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This is a common negotiation tactic to set a high anchor point.
* **Room for Compromise:** The offer still leaves room for negotiation, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he's not even close to this price, I can immediately switch to John and get my minimum desired price.

**Note:**  This is just a starting point. Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my negotiation strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** I believe there's still potential for negotiation. I'm willing to explore further counteroffers to see if we can reach a price closer to my minimum desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance I could get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's offer and formulate a counteroffer that will keep the negotiation moving forward while also ensuring I don't lose too much value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is closer to Bob's offer and demonstrates my willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I won't lose money on the deal. 
* **Testing the Limits:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's commitment to the deal and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching an agreement with Bob. By moving my price closer to his offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price, I'm showing flexibility and increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it is getting closer to my perceived value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  However, at this point,  the negotiation is becoming more risky. It is unclear if Bob is genuinely interested in reaching an agreement or simply trying to get the product at a lower price.  
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum desired price and a safe option. 

**Decision:**

The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain. I am confident that I can secure a higher price with John, so I will accept his offer."
