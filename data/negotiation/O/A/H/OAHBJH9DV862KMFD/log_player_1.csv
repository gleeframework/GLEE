"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $100 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, but I'll make a counteroffer that reflects my value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find this product worthwhile at that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $100 if this deal falls through, so accepting Bob's offer is the most advantageous option."
