Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to give me a good profit, but it's also lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired profit. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $102.50 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd rather sell to Bob than to John for a lower price."
