Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob likely has a higher value for the product than I do, making him more likely to accept.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only $5 below my initial offer, and still above my minimum.  It's in my best interest to accept and move on rather than risk further negotiation."
