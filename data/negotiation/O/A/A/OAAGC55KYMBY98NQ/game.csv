"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $925,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,5,
