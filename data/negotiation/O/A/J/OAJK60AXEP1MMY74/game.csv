"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a little too high for my budget.  How about we try $750,000?  That's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
