(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my preferred price, but it's within my budget and a significant drop from her initial offer. With only 5 rounds left, I'm willing to accept to secure the product. It's also possible that Alice will not budge further and I might end up buying from John for $100 anyway."
