Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price if Bob values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John for $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for him to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, significantly higher than selling to John, and it seems like we're close to a final agreement. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob and being forced to sell to John for less."
