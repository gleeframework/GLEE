"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product has value, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000.  This is a more realistic reflection of what it can do for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That being said, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
