"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
