Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in the product, your price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll bring to it.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $800,000, especially given its potential future applications.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I see the value in the product,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's current value and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant increase, and it's not worth the risk of losing the $1,000,000 guaranteed by John."
