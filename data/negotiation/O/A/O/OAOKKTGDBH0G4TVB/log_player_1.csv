Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 reflects the true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price point offers a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps $13,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. It's getting closer.  To be honest though, I have a firm budget, and $14,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to make the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to go above $14,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer for $15,000."
