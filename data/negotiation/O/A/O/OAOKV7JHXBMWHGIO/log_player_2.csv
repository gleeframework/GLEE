"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to get a lower price. You know the product is worth less to you than to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. You can start by rejecting her offer and seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my maximum value. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and hoping to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. However, this offer is closer to my maximum value, so I'll try to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and might lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a better price.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise between our two values.  If she accepts, I'll get the product at my maximum value. If she rejects, I can still go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is very close to my maximum value, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product, rather than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a slightly higher price."
