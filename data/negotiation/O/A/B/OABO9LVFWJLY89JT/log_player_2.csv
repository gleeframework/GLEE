Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is $170. It's too high, so rejecting the offer makes sense. You can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $160 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum. You can try to get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, you've negotiated for several rounds and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $152. While this is close to your maximum value, it's still not a good deal. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $120 from John, so it's better to accept John's offer and save $32."
