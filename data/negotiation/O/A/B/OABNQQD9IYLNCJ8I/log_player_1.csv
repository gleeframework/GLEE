Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) sets the stage for a negotiation.  
* **Not too high:**  $110 is within a range where Bob might still be interested, but it gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the value of the product makes Bob more likely to consider my offer. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned $110.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I'm better off selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I value the product at $100, so accepting his $90 offer would be a loss.
* **Potential for a higher price:** While Bob's offer is lower, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's potential for a counteroffer that would be more advantageous for me.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $100, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $100, potentially $95 or $98. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Highlight value:**  I emphasize the product's quality to justify the higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profit of $95.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer. If it's still below $100, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose $92 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $92 is still slightly below my ideal price of $100, it's only $8 less. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. If I reject this, he might refuse to go higher, leaving me with John's $100 offer. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob may take more time and effort without a guarantee of a significantly better price.

**Next steps:**

I've accepted Bob's offer and successfully sold the product. I've earned $92, which is a decent profit and close to my desired minimum."
