{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than what I'd get from John and only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
