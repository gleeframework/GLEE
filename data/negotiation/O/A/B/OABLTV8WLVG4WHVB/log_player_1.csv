"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $17,000 in the remaining rounds. Accepting $14,500 would mean losing out on potential profit. John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
