"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $15,000.  I want to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
