"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,
