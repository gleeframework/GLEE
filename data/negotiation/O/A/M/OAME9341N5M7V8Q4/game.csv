"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair price that allows both of us to be happy.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9,750? It's the best I can do, but I really want to make this deal work.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go below $10,000. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be satisfied with the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
