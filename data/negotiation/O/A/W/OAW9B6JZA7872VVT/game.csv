"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great value, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? That's the absolute most I can spend on this right now.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're able to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
