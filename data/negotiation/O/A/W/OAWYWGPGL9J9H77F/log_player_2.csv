Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very insistent on getting a price above John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go below $10,500, and even that price is not ideal.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees the best price."
