Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $120, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to try to get a bit more by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial asking price and is still a good deal for me.  It's worth accepting rather than risking a further counter-offer and potentially ending up with only $120 from John."
