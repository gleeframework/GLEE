Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is fair, given the value of the product and the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
