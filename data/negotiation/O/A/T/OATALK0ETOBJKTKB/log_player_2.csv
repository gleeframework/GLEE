"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs. $1,200,000). As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible, so accepting this offer would be a bad move.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better price through counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is fair, given the value of the product and the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects its value and potential benefits, while also being a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a slight improvement from her previous offer, but it's still below what I'm willing to pay.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price, considering that the product is worth $1,200,000 to her and I'm open to paying a substantial amount.  Continuing to counteroffer allows me to potentially save more money without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This price acknowledges your need to make a profit while allowing me to acquire the product at a price that makes sense for me."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,075,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,090,000 for the product. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to save even more,  rejecting this offer and continuing to counteroffer might risk losing the deal altogether. It's important to consider the possibility of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or even increasing her price if I reject her offer.  

Therefore, accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable price, saving $110,000 compared to buying from John."
