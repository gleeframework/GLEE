Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while showing you're serious about selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob won't budge much further.  I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price, so I'll sell the product to him instead of risking further negotiation with Bob."
