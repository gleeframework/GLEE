"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows us both to come to an agreeable deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This price takes into account your willingness to compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of this product, $11,500 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250.
