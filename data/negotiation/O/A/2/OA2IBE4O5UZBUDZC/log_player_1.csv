Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit below $110, how about $105?

You have three options:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems firm on his offer of $105. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $5, whereas continuing the negotiation risks him lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's $100 offer."
