"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've offered. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $1050000 / 2 = $525000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",525000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid your counteroffer is not even close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I've already made concessions and compromised, and I'm not willing to go below $1000000. I think we're done here. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1000000. It was nice negotiating with you, but I think we've reached an impasse.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
