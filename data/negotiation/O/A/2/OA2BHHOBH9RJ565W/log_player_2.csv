# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to proceed with.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer. I'm happy to accept this offer and save a substantial amount of money."
