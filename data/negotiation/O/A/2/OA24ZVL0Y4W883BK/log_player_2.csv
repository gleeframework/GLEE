"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  While I can't disclose the exact details of the product right now, I can assure you that it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm offering it to you for [Insert Price Here], which I believe is a fair and competitive price considering its potential.  If you're interested, we can schedule a time to discuss the product further and explore its potential benefits for your company. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than the price John is willing to sell for ($1,000,000). This means accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000.  While Bob doesn't know the true value of the product, he knows it's worth at least $800,000 to Alice.  This suggests a potential upside beyond just saving money."
