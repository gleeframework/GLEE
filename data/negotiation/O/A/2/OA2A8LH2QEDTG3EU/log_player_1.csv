Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit. Let's find common ground.

To be honest, I'm getting close to walking away and selling to John for $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $1,300,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
