"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. Let's try $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob time to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's make a deal and avoid going back and forth further."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  I understand your budget, but $1,250,000 just isn't going to work for me. To be honest, I'm getting close to walking away and selling to John for $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $1,300,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is becoming difficult:** Alice is threatening to sell to John, indicating a possible breakdown in negotiations.
* **John's offer is a safe option:** Bob can secure the product for his maximum budget by buying from John. It's better to take a sure thing rather than risk losing the product completely or ending up with a deal that's still too expensive."
