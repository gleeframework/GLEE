Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $4,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and makes him more likely to accept.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob knows exactly what you're proposing. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, we can still do better.  Bob clearly sees the value in the product, so there's room for a higher price.  Let's counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and still allows me a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,750 is a good compromise.  It's more than what John would pay, and we're still getting a decent profit.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option here."
