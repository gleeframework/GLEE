Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and John guarantees $1,000,000. Therefore, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it slightly above his valuation might not be tempting enough.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $950,000 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly. 

By starting with a strong offer, I increase the chances of securing a deal that surpasses the guaranteed sale to John."
