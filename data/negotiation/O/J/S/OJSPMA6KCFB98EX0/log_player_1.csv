Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John provides leverage. You're not desperate, which strengthens your position.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while still having a safety net with John."
