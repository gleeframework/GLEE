Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This gives him a good deal, as the product is worth $12,000 to him, while still allowing me to make a profit of $2,000, which is more than selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for me, as it is above my minimum price of $8,000 and closer to my initial offer. Accepting his offer allows me to secure the sale without risking further negotiation and potential rejection."
