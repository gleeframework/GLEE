"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident that the value this product brings significantly exceeds $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
