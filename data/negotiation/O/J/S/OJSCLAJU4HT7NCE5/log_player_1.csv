Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that you are serious about a good deal but are not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value I place on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better deal for myself."
