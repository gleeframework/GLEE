# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're extending an exclusive offer to you. Would you be interested in acquiring it for $100? We're confident this price reflects the true worth of the product while providing you with an excellent opportunity to experience its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have another option with John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject the initial offer."
