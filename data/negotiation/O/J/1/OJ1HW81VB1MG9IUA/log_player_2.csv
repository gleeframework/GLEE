"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm thinking of a price around $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a competitive price for this product. Could you meet me halfway at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial $14,000, it's still above my budget of $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate further with Alice before considering John's offer."
