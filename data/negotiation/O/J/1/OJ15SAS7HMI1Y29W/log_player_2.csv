"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is offering it at $10,000, you're not saving any money by accepting her offer.  You're better off rejecting her offer and buying from John for the same price."
