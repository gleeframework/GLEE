Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his minimum, as I know the product is valuable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  While I could sell to John now for $15,000, I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but also that I won't go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still below my minimum, and I've already lowered my price once. While I could keep negotiating, it's getting close to John's offer. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to secure a sale."
