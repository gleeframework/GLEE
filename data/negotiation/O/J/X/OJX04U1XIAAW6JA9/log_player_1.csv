I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate, but if not, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price. I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price in the middle between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to drop my price too far below what I think the product is worth."
