Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your value for the product and the potential value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
