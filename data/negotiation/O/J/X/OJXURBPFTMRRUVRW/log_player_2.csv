"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower, saving yourself a significant amount of money.  The counteroffer strategy allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your value for the product and the potential value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being a compromise that works for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000. This is a good price for you, as it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible move, securing a good deal and avoiding unnecessary risk."
