Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but significantly above my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable deal.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price can make it more palatable to Bob. 
* **Alternative Option (John):** I'm aware I have a backup buyer at $100, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value. There's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to try and meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? It's a great deal for a product you'll value at $120."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential gain he receives from the purchase.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a reasonable position. I'm prepared to accept this offer or negotiate slightly lower, but going below $108 would likely lead me to accept John's offer instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** While not ideal, $107.50 is still a reasonable profit margin above my minimum of $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further negotiation risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer secures a solid profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now allows me to move on to other potential deals."
