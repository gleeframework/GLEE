"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I see its value, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
