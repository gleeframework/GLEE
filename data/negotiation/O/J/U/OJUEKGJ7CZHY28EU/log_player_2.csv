"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have a good starting point to counteroffer and try to secure a lower price, potentially saving yourself some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I see its value, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my counteroffer:**  $875,000 is only $25,000 more than my offer of $850,000. 
* **The potential for further negotiation is limited:**  It's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming, and I might not be able to get a significantly lower price.
* **A good deal:**  $875,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000.  This is a good deal."
