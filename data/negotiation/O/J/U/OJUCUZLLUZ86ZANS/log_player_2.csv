"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know this is a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  It's also a good price for me, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,500,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to potentially negotiating a better price with her or proceeding with your backup plan with John and saving a significant amount of money."
