,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for this product.  Its unique capabilities are truly unmatched, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that reflects its value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. Can we compromise at this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,

It's a unique opportunity to gain access to [mention specific key features or benefits], which can significantly boost your [mention Bob's potential gains].  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
