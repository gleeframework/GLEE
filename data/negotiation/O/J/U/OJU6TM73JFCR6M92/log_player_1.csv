"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value!  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""steal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Motivating action:** I'm urging Bob to act (""Let's make this deal happen"") to increase the chances of closing the deal in this round.

**Remember:**  This is a risky strategy.  If Bob rejects this offer outright, I might need to negotiate down considerably or even resort to selling to John for $1,000,000. However, the high starting point gives me leverage and room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have John as a backup buyer.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can counter with a lower price, but still closer to my target.
* **Test Bob's limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I can see how committed he is to buying the product.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, but still below my initial offer. I'll also try to emphasize the unique value proposition of the product to encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for this product.  Its unique capabilities are truly unmatched, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that reflects its value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer to show that I'm taking his proposal seriously.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the unique value and capabilities of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Compromise Language:**  I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""find a compromise"" to suggest that I'm open to further negotiation but still maintain my stance on the value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,050,000 is a compromise price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my original asking price, demonstrating flexibility.

**Reasoning:**

By rejecting Bob's offer and making this counteroffer, I'm aiming to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This counteroffer will reveal how seriously Bob wants the product. 
* **Move Closer to Target:**  While still below my ideal price, $1,050,000 brings me closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

Depending on Bob's reaction to this counteroffer, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round. If he rejects again, I may need to further lower my price, but I'll still aim to stay above $1,000,000.  If he accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. Can we compromise at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my value. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's still potential for Bob to raise his offer, especially if he realizes that I'm willing to walk away.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me, as it's below my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target, perhaps $1,025,000. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting close to my minimum price, while still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 still doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity to gain access to [mention specific key features or benefits], which can significantly boost your [mention Bob's potential gains].  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reiterate Value:** I'm emphasizing the unique value and potential benefits of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Highlight Bob's Gains:** I'm connecting the product's benefits to Bob's specific needs and goals to make the offer more appealing.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""make this happen"" to show my willingness to compromise but maintain my stance on value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,025,000 is a slight decrease from my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer further narrows the gap between my price and Bob's offer.
* **Increased Pressure:** By showing flexibility while still maintaining my stance on value, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Testing Bob's Commitment:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly interested in the product or if he's just trying to get a lower price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely need to consider selling to John. However, if Bob accepts, I'll have successfully negotiated a deal that's profitable for me while still satisfying Bob's needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the benefits of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum.  There are only 4 rounds remaining, and I don't want to risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures that I don't lose money on this deal.
* **Limited Time:** With only four rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Potential Loss:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price, which would be worse than selling to John.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
