Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is significant too. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $1,200,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value to Bob. It also invites a response, encouraging Bob to start the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Higher Starting Point:** Starting high allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not unreasonable, giving Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, appealing to his interests.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,000,000, setting a lower limit on my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can push for a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, the potential for a higher price from Bob outweighs the risk of rejection."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit low for me right now.  I'm confident this product holds a lot of value for you, and I'm prepared to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I've countered with $1,050,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Reasoning:** This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, reinforcing the product's value and highlighting the fairness of my counteroffer. It also emphasizes the positive outcome of a successful deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain Momentum:**  Continuing the negotiation keeps the potential for a higher price alive.
* **Be Realistic:** The offer is within a reasonable range, giving Bob a strong incentive to accept.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message continues to emphasize the product's value to Bob, appealing to his interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so how about we settle on $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $1,000,000, Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is too low.  It's getting increasingly difficult to negotiate, and  I'm concerned about the risk of further rejections. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Further Rejection:** I don't want to risk further negotiation and potential rejections, which could lower the final price even more.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a more secure outcome.
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could take a lot of time, and I may not be able to reach a price I'm happy with.

**Decision:**

The potential for a higher price from Bob is not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John provides a guaranteed, acceptable outcome."
