Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests some room for negotiation, accepting his initial offer would be a substantial loss. It's strategically better to counter-offer and see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget considerations, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it presents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While a significant drop from the initial price, it shows a willingness to negotiate and keeps the offer significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, justifying the higher price point.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This counter-offer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,700,000 is still above my budget, I would like to propose $1,400,000 as a compromise. I believe this offers a reasonable price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,400,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the negotiation."
