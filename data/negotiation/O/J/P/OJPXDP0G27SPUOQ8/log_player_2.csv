"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you.  Let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not convinced that Alice's offer is the best deal. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'd be leaving $300,000 on the table by accepting her offer. I'd rather reject her offer and buy the product from John for the full $1,500,000.
