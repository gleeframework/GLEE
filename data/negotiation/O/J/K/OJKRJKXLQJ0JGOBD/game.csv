"Thanks for the offer Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $10,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This would get us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
