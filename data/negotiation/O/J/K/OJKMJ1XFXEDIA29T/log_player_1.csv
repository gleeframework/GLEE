"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects, I can then consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a lot closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  It's only round 2, and I have plenty of time to negotiate with Bob. I'll reject his offer and send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair price, given his perceived value of the product. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
