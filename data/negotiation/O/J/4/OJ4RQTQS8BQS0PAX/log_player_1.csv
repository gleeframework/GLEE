Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. You could potentially accept a price as low as $115 and still make a profit compared to selling to John.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""value"" rather than just the price, hoping to sway Bob's perception. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $125. He might counter-offer, or reject the offer outright. Your strategy should adapt based on his response."
