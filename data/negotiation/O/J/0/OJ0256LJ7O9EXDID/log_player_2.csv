Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $135 for the product? It's still a good deal for you compared to its value, and it's higher than my initial offer, ensuring a satisfactory profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.
