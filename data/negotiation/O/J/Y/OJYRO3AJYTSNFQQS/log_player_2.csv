"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than its actual cost. Given its high quality and unique features, we're confident it would be a valuable addition to your collection. We're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $100. This is a special opportunity considering its true value is $120. We hope you find this offer compelling and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you have an alternative option with John for $120.  It's worth seeing if Alice might be willing to lower her price further."
