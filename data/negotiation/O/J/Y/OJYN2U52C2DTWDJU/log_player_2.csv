Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I would like to offer a compromise. How about $10,800 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  Let's split the difference and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
