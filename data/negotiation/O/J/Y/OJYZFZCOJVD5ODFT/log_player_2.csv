Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12500.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and he still has several rounds to try and negotiate further. Rejecting allows him to continue the negotiation and hopefully get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, incrementally moving towards his maximum price point. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance. This approach aims to create a sense of momentum and pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's desired range."
