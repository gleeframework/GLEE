Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds. I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of him backing out completely."
