"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12500.  It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
