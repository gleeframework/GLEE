"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $9,000 right now. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $10,200 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $9,500.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $10,000, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $9,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the price down, but I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is my last offer, so I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",9800.0,Alice,7,
