Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,199,999. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my minimum acceptable price. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to push Bob as close to that as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While my initial offer is high, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Urgency and Value:** My message hints at the product's value to Bob and subtly implies I have other interested buyers by mentioning my ""minimum acceptable price."""
