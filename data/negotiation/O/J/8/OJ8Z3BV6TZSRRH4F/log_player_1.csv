"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob to make the price seem more appealing.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in a negotiation rather than immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, and I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay my minimum, I still believe I can potentially secure a higher price from Bob with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still below his offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still reflects the substantial value of this product for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **Collaborative Approach:** I use language like ""find a solution"" to encourage a win-win outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob and brings us closer to an agreement. If he rejects again, I will continue to adjust my offers based on his responses, remaining flexible while aiming to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $1,300,000 as a compromise. This allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation room:** I have 6 rounds left and believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.  
* **John's offer:** While selling to John would secure my minimum, I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price. I will continue to assess the situation and adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and willing to be flexible. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Open Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and gauge Bob's willingness to move forward.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more enticing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal. If he rejects it, I'll carefully assess the remaining rounds and consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. I'm determined to get the best possible price, but I also need to be strategic and avoid losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my previous offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** We have only 4 rounds remaining, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to get a slightly higher price with more negotiation, there's a risk of Bob backing out or my counteroffers being rejected, leading to me having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal, as it's a good compromise that allows me to secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
