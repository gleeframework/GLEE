"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  To be frank,  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant and unique value, which I'm sure you recognize. How about we meet closer to the middle at $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
