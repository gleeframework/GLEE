Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage.  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception at a higher price point. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss. If Bob negotiates, you can gradually lower the price, aiming to secure the highest possible amount above your $1,200,000 baseline."
