""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy it for $800,000, but aiming higher is in your best interest.
* **The Offer:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.  This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's valuation."
