Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is well above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates. 

By starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation, you increase the likelihood of him accepting without further negotiation, leading to a higher profit for you."
