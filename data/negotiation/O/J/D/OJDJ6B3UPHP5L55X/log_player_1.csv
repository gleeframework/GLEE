Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob values the product higher than your minimum and John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Going too close to $15,000 (Bob's perceived value) might make him feel like there's no room for negotiation and he might walk away."
