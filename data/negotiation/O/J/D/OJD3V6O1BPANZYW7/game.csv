"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and the time it would take to negotiate further. Let's make this a quick and easy deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply not feasible for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1750000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to close this deal quickly. Let's move forward and avoid further negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
