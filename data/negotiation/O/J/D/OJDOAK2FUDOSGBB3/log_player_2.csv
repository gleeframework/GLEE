"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a price of $12,000. It's a rare and highly sought-after item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to get a significant profit margin. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or resort to buying from John at your maximum budget."
