"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $9,500.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* While it's a better deal than John's offer, it's not within your acceptable price range. 
* You can reject Alice's offer and still purchase the product from John, even if it costs more."
