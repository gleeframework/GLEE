Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes its value to him at $1,000,000. He saves $50,000, and you earn a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is a strong starting point, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters."
