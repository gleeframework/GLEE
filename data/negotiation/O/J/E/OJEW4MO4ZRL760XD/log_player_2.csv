"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. It's a great deal on something I know you'll love! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $175 is higher than your maximum budget of $150 and more expensive than buying from John. Buying from John at $150 is the best way to save money."
