Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your ideal price. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have gone higher. If he negotiates, I have room to go down while still making a significant profit. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The worst-case scenario is Bob rejecting the offer, but I'm covered as I have John willing to buy at my minimum acceptable price."
