"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price.  $825,000 is too low for me, and I still have time to negotiate before needing to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, but $825,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, as I mentioned before. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached a point where it's clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations. I've made significant concessions and he doesn't seem willing to budge. Given the limited time remaining and the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the $800,000."
