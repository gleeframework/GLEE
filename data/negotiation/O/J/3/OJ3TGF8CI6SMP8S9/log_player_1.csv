Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before you move on to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to find a price that's enticing to Bob (significantly higher than your minimum) but still leaves you with a substantial profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price that reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value, subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Price: $1,350,000** This price positions the product as a great deal for Bob (saving him $150,000) while netting you a significant $350,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a clear idea of your walk-away point. 
* **Relationship:** While aiming for profit is important, consider the potential for a future relationship with Bob if this deal goes well. A slightly more flexible approach might be beneficial in the long run.
