Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low. It's below the value I need to get for it. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for you, as I really value your interest. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000, and your goal is to spend no more than $8,000. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John."
