"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low. It's below the value I need to get for it. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $5,000 was too low, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for you, as I really value your interest. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
