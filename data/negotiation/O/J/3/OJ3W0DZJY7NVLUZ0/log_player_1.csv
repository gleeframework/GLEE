Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob might scare him off.  Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" create a sense of urgency and importance, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Highlighting:** By stating ""significant value for someone with your interests,"" Alice subtly appeals to Bob's potential motivations for buying, making the offer more enticing."
