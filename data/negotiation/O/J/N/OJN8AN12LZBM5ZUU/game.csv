"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a great product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $14000? ",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $16500 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to have to stick with my initial offer of $14000. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $15800. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",15800.0,Alice,5,
