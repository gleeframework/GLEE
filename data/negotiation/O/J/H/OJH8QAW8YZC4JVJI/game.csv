"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $12,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
