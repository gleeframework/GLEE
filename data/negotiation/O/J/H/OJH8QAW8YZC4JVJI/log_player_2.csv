"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's above Bob's budget and doesn't leave room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a tactic to show his seriousness about buying the product while also establishing a starting point for negotiation. By stating his willingness to find a ""middle ground,"" Bob is inviting Alice to continue the negotiation and hopefully find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price of $12,000.  He still has a few rounds left to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $12,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $12,000. He's making a counteroffer that's only $500 above his ideal price, showing his willingness to negotiate but also setting a clear limit.  The message also emphasizes his readiness to close the deal at this price, potentially making Alice more motivated to accept."
