"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product.  I believe it gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with the $1,500,000 offer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm willing to continue the negotiation, but will keep in mind my option to sell to John if things don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  With only 6 rounds left, it's in my best interest to accept and secure the deal."
