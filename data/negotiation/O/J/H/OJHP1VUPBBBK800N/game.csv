"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's worth.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we try $11,500? That's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this. How about $12,500?  This offer reflects the product's value while still providing you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think we can do a bit better. How about we try $12,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,500, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,6,
