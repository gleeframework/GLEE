"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
