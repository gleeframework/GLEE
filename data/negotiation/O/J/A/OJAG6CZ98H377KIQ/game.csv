"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750? That's the highest I can go.",7750.0,Bob,4,
