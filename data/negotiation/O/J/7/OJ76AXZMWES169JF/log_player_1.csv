Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be quite valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $120 offer allows for potential back-and-forth. Bob might try to negotiate down, and you can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, maximizing potential profit if he accepts without negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything because you have a guaranteed sale to John for $150."
