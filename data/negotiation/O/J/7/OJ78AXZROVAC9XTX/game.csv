"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  It's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,125. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I think we can close this out. Let me know what you think.",8125.0,Alice,5,
