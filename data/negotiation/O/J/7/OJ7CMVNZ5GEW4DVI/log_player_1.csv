Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential while remaining within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you offering a price.  I've given this a lot of thought, and while I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident this product has great potential, but I can only offer $950,000. This reflects my budget and my belief in the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a long and arduous process to reach a price I find acceptable.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a sure thing and saves me valuable time and negotiation energy."
