"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations. Let's aim for a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us. How about we start at $140?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position, and we'd like to try to meet somewhere in the middle. How about we consider $135 as a starting point for further negotiation? This reflects a compromise between our initial offers.",135.0,Alice,3,
