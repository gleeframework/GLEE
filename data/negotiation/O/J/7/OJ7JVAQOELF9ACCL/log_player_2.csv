"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own value of $120.  He's offering $105, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** Bob is expressing interest but is firm about his price point.  He's being respectful while also being clear about his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? This is a really great product, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting now means Bob saves $10 compared to buying from John, but there's a chance he can get it for even less if he keeps negotiating. 
* **Strategy:** Continuing to negotiate might allow Bob to achieve a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $108.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving the needle:** Bob is showing flexibility by moving up to $108, but still remaining firm in his desire to get a good deal. 
* **Finding the middle ground:** By suggesting meeting halfway, Bob is making a clear and specific proposition.
* **Confidence:**  Bob is demonstrating that he's confident in his position, which can make Alice more likely to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your offer, $108 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109.  How about we close this deal at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $109 is just $1 over Bob's ideal price of $108.
* **Potential for more negotiation:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might get more stubborn or reject further offers. 
* **Time constraint:**  With only five rounds left, accepting now guarantees a good deal and leaves room for potential future negotiation if the product proves to be valuable."
