"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? This is a really great product, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your offer, $108 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109.  How about we close this deal at that price?",109.0,Alice,5,
