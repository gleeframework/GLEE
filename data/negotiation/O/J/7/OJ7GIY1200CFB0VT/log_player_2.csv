# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1200000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to show my willingness to work with you. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a much more realistic starting point.
