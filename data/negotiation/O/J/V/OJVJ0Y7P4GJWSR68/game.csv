"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
