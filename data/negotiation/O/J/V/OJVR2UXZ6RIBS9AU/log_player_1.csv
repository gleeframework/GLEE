Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **John's offer as a baseline:** Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, this is the minimum I am willing to accept.
* **Potential for higher value:** I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I want to try and get a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering $1,500,000 is a calculated risk. It's possible Bob will reject the offer, but there's also a chance he might find the product valuable enough to pay the higher price.  

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the security of John's offer as a fallback."
