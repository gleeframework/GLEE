"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to spend.  To get this deal moving, I'm offering $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 doesn't reflect its full potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still more than I can reasonably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, a price that's a significant compromise for me and allows for some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's find a middle ground - I propose $1,450,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to close this deal while ensuring a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I can see you're serious about this purchase.  How about we settle this right now at $1,375,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get to $1,300,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Bob,8,
