Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I have 9 rounds left and can always sell to John if necessary."

Round 3

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000.

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I have several rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000?

Let's see if we can find common ground on this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $975,000 is still significantly less than my minimum. I'm going to counter again with a slightly lower price but still closer to my target.  I have four rounds left, and if necessary, I can always sell to John."
