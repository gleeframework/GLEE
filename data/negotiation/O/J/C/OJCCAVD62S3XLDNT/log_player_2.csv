"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Budget Mention:** By mentioning a ""limited budget,"" we're subtly signaling to Alice that we might be willing to walk away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $9,500 is still above your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's statement about this being ""the lowest she can go"" is likely a negotiating tactic. There's a good chance she's willing to go lower with further bargaining. 
* **John is our Backup:** Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. Would you consider $7,500? That would help me fit this purchase within my budget."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but not dramatically. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost. 
* **Budget Emphasis:**  By reiterating our budget constraints, we're politely reminding Alice that we have a firm limit.
* **Middle Ground:** $7,500 is a price point slightly below John's offer, putting pressure on Alice while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Your Limit:** Alice has met your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Plus, John's offer is also $8,000.
* **Secure the Product:** Accepting now ensures you get the product at your target price."
