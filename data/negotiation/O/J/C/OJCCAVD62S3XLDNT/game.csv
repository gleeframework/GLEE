"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",8000.0,Alice,5,
