"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe you'll find great value in it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only go up to $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and still allows me to make a profit. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $12000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is closer to your offer. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm trying to be realistic here. $15500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as I can, but $13000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is closer to your offer.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this transaction. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer. ",13500.0,Bob,8,
