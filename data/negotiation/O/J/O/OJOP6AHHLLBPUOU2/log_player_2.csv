Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $98. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98

While it's not ideal to go above $90, Alice seems firm, and this price is still better than John's offer. Accepting at $98 avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
