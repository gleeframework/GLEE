"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $120 limit and John's offer of $120. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
