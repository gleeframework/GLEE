"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we compromise at $875000? This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm willing to make it happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $825000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
