"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my potential profit, so I'm starting with a price that's closer to the value Bob places on the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $100, I leave space for Bob to counteroffer and for us to find a middle ground.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $90?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price of $100.
* **Not a significant drop:** Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial offer, which is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further before accepting his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about $95?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm serious about making a deal while still aiming for a good price.
* **Leaving room for further compromise:**  By offering $95, I leave a small window for Bob to counteroffer once more before accepting. This keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Positive tone:** A positive message encourages Bob to feel like we're working together to find a solution that benefits both of us."
