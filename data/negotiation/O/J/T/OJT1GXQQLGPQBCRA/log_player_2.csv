"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it at $80, I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While Alice believes the product is worth $150 to you, you know it's worth $150 at most. This means you're still getting a good deal."
