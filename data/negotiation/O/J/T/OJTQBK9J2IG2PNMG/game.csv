"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a good compromise, considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,7,
