"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally beneficial to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:** The initial high price acts as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value, it sets a reference point for subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows us to see how Bob reacts. If he immediately rejects it outright, we know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, even at a much lower price, it signals a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  Even though we have a guaranteed offer from John, it's strategically better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Would you consider a significant price reduction? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This indicates that:

* **Bob has room to move:** He's likely lowballing you to see how much you're willing to concede.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  The fact that he made a counteroffer at all suggests he's interested in finding a mutually agreeable price.

Accepting his offer now would be leaving a lot of money on the table. Selling to John is a safe option, but we can likely negotiate a better deal with Bob with some more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we want to stand firm on our value, a smaller concession in this round shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable offer.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** This counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's stated value, giving us room for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on him to increase his offer considerably.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to reiterate the product's value while expressing willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. Would you consider $700,000? That's a firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000, signaling that he's trying to move slowly and cautiously. 
* **Below Perceived Value:**  His offer is still significantly below his own stated value of $800,000. 
* **Leverage:** We still have time and the guaranteed offer from John. This gives us leverage to push Bob closer to a more reasonable price. 

We need to show Bob that we're willing to walk away if he doesn't make a substantial move toward our price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more serious commitment from your side. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for this product. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're not willing to endlessly negotiate. 
* **Calculated Risk:** We're taking a calculated risk by significantly lowering our price but making it clear that this is the bottom line. 
* **Maintaining Value:** While a significant drop from our previous offer, $1,600,000 is still well above Bob's offer and allows us to maintain a strong profit margin.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, we need to push Bob toward a decision. This firm stance encourages him to either meet our price or risk losing the deal altogether."
