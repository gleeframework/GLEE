"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me ($120) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter with $112. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower and are now below my minimum acceptable price.  I've tried to compromise, but we're not making much progress.  It's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum and guarantees a sale."
