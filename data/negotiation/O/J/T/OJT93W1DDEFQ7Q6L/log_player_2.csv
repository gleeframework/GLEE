"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price considering your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's still a potential to negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a much higher price is not worth it. Accepting this offer saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John."
