{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000, making it appealing to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for him, making it more likely he'll be receptive. 

This offer balances the need to get a good price with the desire to keep the negotiation moving and not immediately scare Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000? I believe this might be closer to a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  This shows that I'm serious about getting a good price and am willing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range.  I'm confident that I can achieve a better price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still below what I need to make this a worthwhile deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,237,500.  This is a small adjustment but brings us closer to an agreement. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 1237500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,237,500:** This counteroffer is a very small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints and reiterate that my price needs to be higher.  I use a persuasive tone and emphasize the closeness of our proposed prices, encouraging him to accept this final compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully. I would like to counter with $1,230,000. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It seems we've reached a stalemate.  Rather than continuing to negotiate, I've decided to sell the product to John for the guaranteed price of $1,500,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
