"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in the product, but I'm hoping we can reach a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, that I won't sell the product for less than $1,075,000. Your offer of $1,000,000 is actually lower than that, and I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to hold out for the price I want, and I'm confident that we can reach a deal. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we're at an impasse.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
