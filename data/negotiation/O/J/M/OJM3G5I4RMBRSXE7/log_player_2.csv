Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 even?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you, Bob, that I won't sell the product for less than $1,075,000. Your offer of $1,000,000 is actually lower than that, and I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to hold out for the price I want, and I'm confident that we can reach a deal. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,075,000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we're at an impasse. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely Alice will budge from her $1,075,000 offer.  She's made it clear this is her minimum, and continuing to negotiate could lead to an impasse. Accepting now secures the product for less than John's $1,200,000 price."
