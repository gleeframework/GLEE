Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a strong point, leaving room for potential concessions while still securing a significant profit for you.  It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has some room to pay more than your minimum. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You have already established a higher starting point, and you're in a good position to negotiate. 

Let's counter with a price that still leaves some room for compromise but gets you closer to your desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise from your initial offer, showing flexibility. It still leaves you a healthy profit while demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than what you're willing to accept.  While you could continue to counteroffer, it's clear that negotiating further with Bob will likely result in a price that is too low for your desired profit.  

John's offer of $1,000,000 is your minimum acceptable price, and it's a guaranteed sale.  It's the best option to ensure you achieve your financial goal."
