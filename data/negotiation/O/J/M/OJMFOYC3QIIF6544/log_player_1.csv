Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $18,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $17,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $17,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

Bob is clearly anchored at $17,000 and unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting his offer now secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
