Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're really close to a deal, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14500. However, I still need to make a profit, and $14500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14500 and $15000, which is $14750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting closer to my price, $14,750 is still above my budget of $10,000. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  Buying from John at $10,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity."
