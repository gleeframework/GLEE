"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $12000? This represents a substantial discount for you while still being within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value of the product, I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.

I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $15500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value of the product and the discount you're requesting.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're really close to a deal, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14500. However, I still need to make a profit, and $14500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14500 and $15000, which is $14750. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value of the product and the discount you're requesting.",14750.0,Alice,7,
