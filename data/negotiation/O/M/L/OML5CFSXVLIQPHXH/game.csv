"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $10,000 for it? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a decent profit.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $12,500. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
