"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You have a maximum budget of $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for $12,000. 
* This means you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum value of $10,000. 
* This shows I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to compromise. 
* By offering $10,500, I'm hoping to find a price point where we can both agree, saving me money while still allowing Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer is higher than her initial offer and is closer to my maximum budget of $15,000. 
* However, I'm still not willing to accept this price as I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. 
* By rejecting the offer, I can make another counteroffer and potentially get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice raised her offer slightly, showing she's not willing to drop her price too far.
* However, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price. 
* This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* This approach aims to find a middle ground where both of us can feel comfortable with the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,200 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $15,000.
* While I still prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate might lead to more back and forth, and potentially a stalemate.
* Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price, avoiding potential delays and the risk of having to purchase from John at a higher price."
