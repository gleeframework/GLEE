"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is still a fair price given the value it offers, while also allowing me to save some money. Looking forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This represents a significant discount from the value I place on this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. ",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,075,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
