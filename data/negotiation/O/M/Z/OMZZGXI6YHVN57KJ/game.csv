"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  That way we both get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to meet me at $98?",98.0,Bob,6,
