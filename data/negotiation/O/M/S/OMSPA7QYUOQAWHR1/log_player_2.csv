You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not within your desired range. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but you're not desperate.  Rejecting the offer keeps you in the negotiation and allows you to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, but her offers are still too high.  This counteroffer increases your offer from the previous round, showing that you are serious about buying the product, while still leaving room for Alice to come down further. It's a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price range, but $10,900 is still more than you want to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and you have several rounds left. By rejecting the offer, you can push for a lower price and potentially secure a better deal. You are comfortable with the risk of not striking a deal with Alice as you have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating that you are willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to your target. It's a calculated risk, as you're getting closer to Alice's potential walk-away price, but it shows that you're serious about closing the deal without exceeding your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,850 is very close to your counteroffer of $10,800. It's a good deal for you, saving you $150 compared to buying from John.  You have a few rounds left, but there's a high chance Alice won't budge further.  It's a good time to close the deal and secure the product."
