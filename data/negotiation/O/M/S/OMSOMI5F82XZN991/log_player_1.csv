Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to get as much as possible, but I also want to keep the negotiation moving. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer if I think he's a serious buyer. However, I also have the option of going with John's $12,000 offer if it seems like I won't get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
