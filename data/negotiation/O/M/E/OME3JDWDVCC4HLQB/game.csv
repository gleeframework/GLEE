"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, which is still a discount from the original price. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider a price of $825,000, which is still a discount from the original price. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider a price of $775,000, which is still a discount from the original price. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,7,
