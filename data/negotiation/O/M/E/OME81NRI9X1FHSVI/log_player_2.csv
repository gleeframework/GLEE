"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($15,000) and John's offer ($15,000). By rejecting her offer, you can pursue the guaranteed option of purchasing from John at a lower price."
