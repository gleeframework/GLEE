"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this level.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
