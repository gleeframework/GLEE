"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you.  You have two options:

* **Counteroffer:** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down, especially since you're showing you're interested but have a limit.
* **Buy from John:**  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. It's safer than risking a failed negotiation with Alice.

Since you want to save as much money as possible, **rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering is the best initial strategy.**  You might be able to secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. Even though it's a ""compromise,""  you're still paying more than you're comfortable with.

You have two options:

* **Counteroffer:**  You could try to negotiate further, perhaps offering $1,100,000. However, there's a risk Alice will reject again, and you might be left with no deal.
* **Buy from John:** You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. This is the most risk-averse option.

Since you're focused on saving money and minimizing risk, **rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the safest strategy.** You can lock in the best possible price and avoid further negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It seems she's not willing to budge further.  You have two options:

* **Counteroffer:** You could try to negotiate further, but it's unlikely Alice will change her mind.  This would just prolong the process with an uncertain outcome.
* **Buy from John:**  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000.  This is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget and avoid further negotiation.

Therefore, it's best to **reject Alice's offer and buy from John.** You'll save $200,000 compared to Alice's final offer and avoid the risk of a further stalemate."
