"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is my final offer for now.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer. I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $13,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go up to $14,000. That's my best and final offer for now.",14000.0,Alice,5,
