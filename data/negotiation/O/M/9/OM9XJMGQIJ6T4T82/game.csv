"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price or is there some flexibility to negotiate further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $2,300,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
