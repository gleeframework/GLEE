Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000, significantly higher than John's offer.  This is a common tactic in negotiations.
* **No information:** I have no information about Bob's valuation, so I'm taking a calculated risk. If he values it lower than $2,000,000, he'll likely reject the offer.
* **Potential for profit:** If Bob is willing to pay more, I can earn a higher profit.
* **Fallback option:**  If Bob rejects, I have the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John. 

This offer allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still having a safety net in case Bob isn't interested at this price point."
