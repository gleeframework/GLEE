"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. How about $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter offer aims to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate further. Aiming for a price closer to $90 is still worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm getting closer, Alice. Could you do $95 for it?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a more acceptable price. This keeps the negotiation moving while signaling that we're serious about buying at the right price."
