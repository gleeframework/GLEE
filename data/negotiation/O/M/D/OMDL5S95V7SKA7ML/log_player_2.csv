"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice at $9,000 is cheaper than buying from John at $10,000.
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer and forcing you to buy from John at $10,000 is not worth it."
