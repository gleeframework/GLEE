"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500,  which is still a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $11,750? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round.",11750.0,Alice,5,
