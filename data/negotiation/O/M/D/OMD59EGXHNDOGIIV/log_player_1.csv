"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me a significant starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not satisfied with that price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is still a considerable profit for me and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is close to Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, which is what I can get from John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000.  This is still a considerable profit for me and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay. It also keeps me from being too close to John's offer, leaving some room for potential negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob, or if not, I'm confident in selling to John for $1,500,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm now going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is the price John is willing to pay, so I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob has shown he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach a deal,  I can't risk further negotiation and potentially lose the opportunity to sell to John. I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
