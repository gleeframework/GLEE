Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. It's a valuable asset to me, and I'm sure it will be just as valuable to you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price is still a significant savings for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
