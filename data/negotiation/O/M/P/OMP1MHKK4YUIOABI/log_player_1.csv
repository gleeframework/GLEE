{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves potential for a good profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, which may pique his interest and make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, ensuring the negotiation process can continue.

**Note:** This is just the first step. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest in the product and may be willing to increase his offer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I want to see if I can secure a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a fair price given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not going down to Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and justifying my price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message ends by acknowledging the need for finding a mutually acceptable price, leaving the door open for more negotiation.

**Note:** I'm keeping my price above my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm also trying to avoid pushing Bob away with an offer that's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm willing to take a small risk and try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is clearly interested in the product. There's still a chance he might increase his offer slightly.

**Next steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $15,000 or even slightly higher if I'm feeling bold. I'll also consider the risk of potentially losing Bob altogether and having to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bold but reasonable:** I'm raising my offer slightly, but not by much. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties. This can help sway Bob towards acceptance.
* **Finality:** I'm making it clear that this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Note:** I'm taking a calculated risk here. If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh my options carefully and decide whether to accept John's offer or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low for me:**  $13,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer, and his offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and Bob is not showing any indication of increasing his offer significantly.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether.

**Next steps:**  I'll sell the product to John to secure a decent price and avoid further risk."
