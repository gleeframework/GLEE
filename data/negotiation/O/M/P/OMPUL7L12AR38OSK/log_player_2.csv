"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $950000. This offer is reflective of my desire to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction while maximizing the return on this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice wants at least $1,000,000, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial deal. By rejecting the offer, you can explore a lower price and potentially save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very compelling, but I'm looking to maximize my investment. Would you consider a price of $900,000?  This would still give you a substantial profit and allow me to secure the product at a more favorable price point."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $975000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between maximizing my return and providing you with a competitive offer. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is close to my initial counteroffer, and it's still a good deal for me. I can save $25,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price."
