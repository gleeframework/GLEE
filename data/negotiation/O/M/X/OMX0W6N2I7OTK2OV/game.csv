"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $65 is too low for me. How about we split the difference at $72.50? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price.",72.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $65, but $72.50 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $68?",68.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $68 is still a little low for me. How about we meet at $70? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",70.0,Alice,5,
