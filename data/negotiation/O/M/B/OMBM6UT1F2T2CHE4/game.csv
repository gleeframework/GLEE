"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product at a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you and my original asking price, I'll make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
