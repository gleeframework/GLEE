"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $12000 to us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something around $15000 to start our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is your maximum budget.** There's no immediate advantage to accepting.
* **Negotiation is possible.** Alice is open to discussing a fair price, indicating a potential for a lower price. 
* **Exploring options is key.**  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm interested in the product but at $15,000 it's a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:** The counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your commitment to a deal but also setting a clear starting point for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting your perceived value helps Alice understand your perspective and might incentivize her to consider your offer. 
* **Open to compromise:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to find a solution that works for both parties."
