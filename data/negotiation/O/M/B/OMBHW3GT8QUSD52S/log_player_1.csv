Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm interested in the product but at $15000 it's a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
