Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $750,000. I need to be fair to myself in this negotiation. My last offer is $825,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and she's using strong language to pressure you (""last offer"", ""significant price reduction"").  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
