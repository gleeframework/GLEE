Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $110.  $130 is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's price is getting closer to my limit, her language suggests she won't go much lower. It's not worth the risk of her sticking to $130 or even raising the price. John offers a guaranteed price that fits my budget."
