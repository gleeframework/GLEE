"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think it's worth more than that. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $12,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $15,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $13,500. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still significantly lower than the value I'm placing on this product.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's close this deal!",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,500, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $14,500, which would be $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $14,250, which is a significant concession on my part. This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you've been wanting.",14250.0,Alice,7,
