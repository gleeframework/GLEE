{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer provides room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his $10,000 perceived value, but still well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" of the product helps justify the high initial price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
