"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it right now.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
