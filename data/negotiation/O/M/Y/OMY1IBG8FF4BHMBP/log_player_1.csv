Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a high price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will make a counteroffer, allowing me to get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can get him to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,100,000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than what John is offering, and it seems like we're reaching a stalemate. It's time to close this deal."
