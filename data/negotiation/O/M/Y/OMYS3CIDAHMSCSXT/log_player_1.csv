"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love!  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a good starting point without being too aggressive. I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by showing interest in his opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! The price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm not ready to sell it for that low yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $85? This is a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $120!  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product for him to hopefully make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $80. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $82. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 82}
``` 

I'm offering a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate. I'm also reminding him of the value he places on the product to encourage him to accept."
