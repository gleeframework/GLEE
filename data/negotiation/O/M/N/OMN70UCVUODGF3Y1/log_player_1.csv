Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'd prefer to get as close as possible to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible but still maintains my goal of getting as close to my desired price as possible.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to make the deal worthwhile. Further negotiation could lead to a better price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
