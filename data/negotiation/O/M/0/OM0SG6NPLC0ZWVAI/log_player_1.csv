Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number that reflects the value this product brings.  How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to maximize the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to what I believe is a fair price.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but we're still under John's offer.  There's room to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Your willingness to move up shows you recognize the value here. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Would you consider a final offer of $975,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is signaling this is his final offer and he's unlikely to move significantly higher.  While $975,000 is a decent offer, we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to take the sure bet at this point, even if it's only slightly higher."
