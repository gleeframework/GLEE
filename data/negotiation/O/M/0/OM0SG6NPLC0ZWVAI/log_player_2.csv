"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I need to negotiate a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number that reflects the value this product brings.  How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  I need to continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to maximize the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to what I believe is a fair price.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Your willingness to move up shows you recognize the value here. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still over my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Would you consider a final offer of $975,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}
