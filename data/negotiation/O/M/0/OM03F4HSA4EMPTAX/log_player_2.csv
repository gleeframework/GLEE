"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her value, it's still more than what John is offering. You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
