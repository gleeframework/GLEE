"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This is a fair starting point, as it allows for some room for negotiation while still giving you a profit. I'm aiming to get as close to the $150 value for Bob as possible within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $150. Would you be able to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80 from John, it's still significantly lower than the $120 I initially offered and below the $150 value to Bob. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and go for $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still being within your budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
