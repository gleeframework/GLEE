"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $12000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both of our interests.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. It's a compromise that still leaves some room for profit, but I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.",9500.0,Alice,5,
