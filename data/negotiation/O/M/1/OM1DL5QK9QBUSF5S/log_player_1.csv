{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $115. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
