,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's close this deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
