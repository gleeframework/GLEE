"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I can meet you halfway at $17,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again at $17,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, but I was thinking we could do even better. How about we compromise at $17,250? I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",17250.0,Alice,5,
