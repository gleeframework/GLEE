"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price still leaves room for a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for a counter-offer or to purchase from John for $15,000 if necessary."
