"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000,  considering the value I've placed on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,200. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",15200.0,Bob,4,
