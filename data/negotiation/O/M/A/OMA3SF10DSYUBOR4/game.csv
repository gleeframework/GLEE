"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
