"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I can do $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value for Bob:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering $108.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $120.

While Bob could continue to negotiate,  Alice's offer is close to his limit and significantly better than John's offer.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $12."
