"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $10,000.  You have room to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price, but it's still $1,500 more than you're willing to pay.  You have a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. You can still potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product. Let's reach an agreement so we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your willingness to meet me halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you're still $1,250 above your maximum.  You have a few more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get closer to your ideal price. It's possible you might be able to get her to agree to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $11,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's close this deal, and both of us can walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous negotiations. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 7, and Alice is still unwilling to budge from $11,500.  This is getting close to your maximum, but you're still $1,500 over your target.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating, as you only have a few rounds left.

At this point, it's wiser to secure the product from John for $10,000. You're guaranteed to get the product at your desired price, avoiding the risk of Alice rejecting your final counteroffer and leaving you without the product."
