,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can we meet at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
