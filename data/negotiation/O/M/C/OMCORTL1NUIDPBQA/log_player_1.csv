**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, while still setting a firm price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  By starting high, I aim to get the best possible price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his response, keeping John's offer of $120 as a safety net."
