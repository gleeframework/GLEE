"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,200 is still a little bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $12,500?  That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make.",13000.0,Alice,7,
