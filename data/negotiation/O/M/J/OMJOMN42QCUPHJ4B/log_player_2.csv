Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but $8000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go as low as $18000. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

I'm open to discussing further, but if we can't find a suitable middle ground, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}

# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to pay $8000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. Let me think for a moment... I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but not by much. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $16000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.
