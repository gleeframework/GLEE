"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but $8000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go as low as $18000. Can we compromise on that price?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still out of my price range. As I said before, I'm only able to offer $8000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to discussing further, but if we can't find a suitable middle ground, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $8000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. Let me think for a moment... I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but not by much. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $16000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8000. I'm open to discussing further, but if you're not willing to come down, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
