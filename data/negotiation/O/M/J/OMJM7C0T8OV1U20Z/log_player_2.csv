"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and his maximum budget is $800,000.  Alice's initial offer is well above that, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm ready to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob, who is determined to stay within his $800,000 budget.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should be more in line with your budget, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a step closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps Bob in control of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm eager to close this deal, but $1,050,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to stretch to $900,000, which represents a significant increase from my last offer. It's a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's reach a mutually agreeable price before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer than before, it's not a price that Bob is comfortable with, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  With limited rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
