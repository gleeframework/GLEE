"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,150,000 is still a bit much. How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
