"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $850000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm happy to offer $800000, which is my absolute top limit.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to close the deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $812500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
