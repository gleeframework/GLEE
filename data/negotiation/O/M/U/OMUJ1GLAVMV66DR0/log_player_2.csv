"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a logical first step to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $850,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target of $800,000.  I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm happy to offer $800,000, which is my absolute top limit.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $812500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $812,500 is still above my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. There's no guarantee Alice will budge any further, and I risk losing the product entirely.  I have a reliable alternative with John at $800,000, which is within my budget. It's time to secure the deal and avoid further negotiation."
