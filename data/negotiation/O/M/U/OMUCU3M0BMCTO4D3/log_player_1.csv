Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his perceived value of the product.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer ($800,000) in mind sets a clear ""walk-away"" point during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own stated value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's still room for negotiation. You're better off rejecting this lowball offer and proposing a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  While making a significant concession from the initial offer, this counteroffer remains strong and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By stating it's your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to take the deal seriously. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still comfortably above your fallback option (selling to John for $800,000) while leaving a smaller margin for Bob to negotiate upward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. He also indicated a firm budget. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It makes the most financial sense to accept John's offer now rather than risking further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
