"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best price, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price point is still a bit out of reach for me. Would you consider $700,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you are.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and given you a discount from my original price. I'm willing to give you a bit more room to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still above what I've budgeted for this purchase.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I do need to be mindful of my budget, and I know I have the option to purchase elsewhere at that price. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm prepared to move forward with the other option if we can't reach an agreement on this.",800000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my original price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,7,,
