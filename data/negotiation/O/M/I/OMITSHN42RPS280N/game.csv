"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $128.
