"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1400000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $1300000.  Would you consider $1275000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my limits.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1290000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  However, $1290000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable range. Let's try $1280000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1285000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1285000.0,Alice,7,
