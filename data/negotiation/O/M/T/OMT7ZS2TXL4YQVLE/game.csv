"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
