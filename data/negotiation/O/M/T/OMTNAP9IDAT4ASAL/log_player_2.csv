{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it."", ""product_price"": 8500}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $8900 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still considering the value of the item and ensuring a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to his limit, and he's only got 5 rounds left.  Since John is offering the product for his maximum price, it makes sense to go ahead and buy from him to avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice."
