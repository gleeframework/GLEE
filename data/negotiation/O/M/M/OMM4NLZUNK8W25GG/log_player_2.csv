"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000 is far too high. It's significantly above my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiations and hopefully get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is simply beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues what it offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while still allowing you to reap substantial benefits from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still too high for me. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm determined to get a price closer to my budget.  Rejecting this offer will allow me to continue negotiating and try to get a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's be realistic,  the value this product brings is substantial, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to consider  $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm determined to get a price closer to my maximum of $800,000. Rejecting this offer will allow me to continue negotiating and try to get a more favorable deal. I still have several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price."
