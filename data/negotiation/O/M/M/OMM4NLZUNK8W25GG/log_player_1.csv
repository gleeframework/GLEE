"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to frame the high price as justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end by asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving the door open for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is simply beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer acknowledges the need for me to make a profit, $850,000 is too far from my target. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues what it offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while still allowing you to reap substantial benefits from it."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reframe:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and his attempt to find a compromise. However, I reiterate the product's value to steer away from his low valuation.
* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** I make a substantial drop from my initial price ($150,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, I remain well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. 
* **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that even at this adjusted price, Bob stands to gain considerable value from the product. 

This strategy aims to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation while pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $950,000 is still too far from my $1,200,000 minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement from him to continue with this negotiation.  I'll use my next counteroffer to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's be realistic,  the value this product brings is substantial, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to consider  $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** I'm shifting to a more direct tone, emphasizing that we need to find a realistic agreement.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm nearing my limit. This might encourage Bob to make a more serious offer.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm staying above my $1,200,000 minimum to leave room for potential last-minute negotiation.

This strategy aims to apply pressure while still keeping the door open for a deal with Bob. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product,  $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both stand to gain. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away.  Here's why:

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum.  His increases are incremental, suggesting we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **""Final Offer"" Ignored:** Bob disregarded my ""final offer"" tactic, indicating he might not be willing to meet my price point.
* **John is Secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of ending the negotiation with no deal and potentially missing out on John's offer.

While I could counter again, it's not worth risking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's a good business decision to take the sure thing in this case."
