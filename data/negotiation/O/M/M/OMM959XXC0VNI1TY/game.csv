"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm prepared to come down a little further. How about $90?  That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get what we want.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85",85.0,Bob,6,
