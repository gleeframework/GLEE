{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying ""I'm open to negotiation,"" I signal that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob. This can make him more likely to counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:**  I use positive language like ""amazing"" to make the product seem desirable.

This approach aims to find a balance between maximizing my profit and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer, which will help me gauge his true value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's great that he's interested, I need to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $120 is still an option, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge his interest:**  I start by thanking Bob for his interest, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **State my reason for rejecting his offer:** I explain that his offer is too low, but avoid being accusatory.
* **Offer a compromise:**  Instead of going back to my initial price, I offer a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and his offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Keep it open:** I end with ""Let me know what you think"" to encourage further communication and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm not desperate for a sale, and selling to John for $120 remains a viable option.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm prepared to come down a little further. How about $90?  That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get what we want.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge his perspective:** I reiterate that I understand Bob's desire for a good deal, keeping the negotiation positive and collaborative.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I state that I'm willing to come down further, but not too much. This signals that I'm still serious about getting a fair price.
* **Offer a specific price:** I propose $90, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Highlight the benefit for both:**  I emphasize that $90 is a good compromise that allows both of us to get what we want. This can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Keep it open:** I end with ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going in circles. Rather than risk further rounds of haggling and potentially getting a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John. It's a good deal, and it allows me to move on to other opportunities."
