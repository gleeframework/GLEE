Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know what you think, I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position.  Offering it significantly below John's price allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  ""Open to discussing further""  signals some flexibility, which might be necessary to secure the deal with Bob.

**Objective:**

The aim is to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, ideally closer to your $1,500,000 floor. This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
