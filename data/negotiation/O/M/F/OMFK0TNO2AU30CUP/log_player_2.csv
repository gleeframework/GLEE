"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us. Let's make this deal happen. Would you like to purchase it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since the product is worth $100 to you, Alice's initial offer of $95 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'd like to offer the product at $92, which I believe is a fair compromise. Would you consider purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $92 is a good compromise.  You're saving $8 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions.  It's time to close the deal."
