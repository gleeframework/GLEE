"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to get a better price.  There's room for negotiation since the product is worth more to Alice than to you.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and allows for some room for compromise.  My target is to get the price down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for me, but also allows Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but it's still within a range that's acceptable. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price. There are still rounds left and it seems like Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This amount is still a good deal for me and still allows for some profit margin for Alice.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Alice, leading to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not quite where I want it to be.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can close the deal. It's still early in the negotiation process, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal.  This amount is still significantly lower than Alice's initial price and is a good deal for me. This is a strong counteroffer that could lead to a successful deal in the next round.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $956,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $956,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get the price down further, Alice's offer is getting very close to my target price.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and continuing to reject might risk Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a good price while also leaving some room for potential future profit."
