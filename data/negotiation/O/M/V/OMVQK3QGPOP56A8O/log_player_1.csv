Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm happy to offer it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $20,000 is a high starting point, but it's within the realm of possibility that Bob might value the product even more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for negotiation. If Bob balks at $20,000, you have room to drop the price a bit without going below your minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation positive.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. The best price will depend on many factors, including the actual value of the product to Bob and your negotiation skills. 
* Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $16000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $16,000 is better than selling to John for $15,000, it's still significantly below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000). 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my desired range.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $16,000 but lower than $20,000, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? That feels like a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial price, but not drastically. 
* **Middle Ground:** $18,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it appear like a fair compromise.
* **Encouraging Language:**  The message remains positive and encourages Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is still a relatively high price, leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob rejects this offer. It's important to be flexible while still trying to secure a price that reflects the product's value to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time, and John is already willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Accepting John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. 

**Conclusion:** It's in my best interest to sell the product to John now to avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
