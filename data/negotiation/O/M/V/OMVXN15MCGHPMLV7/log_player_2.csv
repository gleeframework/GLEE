**Explanation:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000.
* **John's offer:** $15,000.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. Since the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, you can likely negotiate a lower price with her. Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a better deal."
