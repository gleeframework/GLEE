Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get as close to my minimum desired price of $150 as possible.  Since I can always sell to John for $150, I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I can always sell to John for the same price.  There's no benefit to continuing negotiations, so I'll accept his offer."
