Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're very interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own goals. I'm willing to make one last push, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000, but I need a firm commitment from you. If not, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is not budging from this price point. It's unlikely she'll go below $1,050,000, and we're only getting closer to the deadline. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is the safer option at this point, even if it means not getting a discount."
