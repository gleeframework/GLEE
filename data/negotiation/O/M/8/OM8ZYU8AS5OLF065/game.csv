"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can do $1200000, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours.  How about $1200000?  That's a fair price that reflects both our needs. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1200000. How about we meet at $1300000? That's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the value I know this product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Since we're both trying to find a solution that works for both of us, how about we split the difference again? Let's meet at $1250000. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our target.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $1300000? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get a price that's closer to what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $1307500? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the value I know this product holds.",1307500.0,Alice,9,
