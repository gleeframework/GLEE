Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you.  While I appreciate you meeting your perceived value, I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budgetary constraints.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  You've hit your maximum budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  It's time to take John's offer."
