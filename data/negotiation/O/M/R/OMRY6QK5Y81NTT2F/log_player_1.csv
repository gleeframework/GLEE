"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more substantial saving. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob, or by selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which still allows me to make a decent profit. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to make a significant saving. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company and the market value.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. It's important to remember that I have 10 rounds, and I'm not desperate to sell.  If Bob doesn't come closer to my price, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not meeting my needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  and offer the product for $1,425,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer. If you are still not convinced, I will be forced to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 1425000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still looking to make a significant saving. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm still not ready to sell for $1,350,000. Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I believe I can push him further. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we are both determined to find a middle ground. I'm ready to compromise further. I'm offering the product for $1,400,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to make a significant saving. I'm willing to pay $1,375,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company and the market value.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Even though I'm only two rounds away from the end of the negotiation with Bob, the time pressure is building. Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm not confident that I can get him to agree to my price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and eliminates the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
