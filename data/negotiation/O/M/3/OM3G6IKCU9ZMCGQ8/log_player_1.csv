"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Starting significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and John's offer creates room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""incredible potential and value,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product at a higher level.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""fair starting point for negotiations"" signals your willingness to engage in a back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while being mindful of not alienating Bob completely with an unreasonably high initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product holds some value for me, but not at that price point.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and what John is offering. While it's good to know he's seriously interested, accepting now would mean a significant loss. Proceeding to the next round to negotiate further is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers to demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done. How about $1,525,000?"",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop, but above minimum:** This counteroffer drastically reduces the price from your initial offer while staying comfortably above both your $1,500,000 minimum and John's standing offer. 
* **Shows flexibility:** Meeting Bob halfway demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still emphasizes value:** The phrasing avoids directly agreeing that $800,000 is close to the product's value, keeping the perceived worth higher in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the previous offer, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try to find a middle ground again? I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, accepting $1,100,000 would still mean a $400,000 loss compared to selling to John. It's worth continuing the negotiation for at least another round to see if you can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,362,500. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1362500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Again, we meet Bob halfway between the previous offers, demonstrating continued willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum.
* **Highlighting the Concession:** By explicitly stating this is a ""significant concession,"" we emphasize the value Bob is receiving and encourage him to reciprocate.
* **Reiterating Deal Closure:**  Mentioning your desire to ""close the deal"" reinforces your interest and encourages Bob to make a more substantial move toward your price. 

This approach maintains pressure on Bob to increase his offer while signaling you're serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  While $1,362,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000 to show my good faith and find a solution we both can agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close!  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is only $300,000 below John's guaranteed offer. With 4 rounds remaining, there's still room to try and close that gap before accepting a lower price. Pushing for a bit more is strategically sound at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer and recognize we're nearing a deal. To show my commitment, I'm prepared to accept a final price of $1,275,000.  This is my best offer, as it represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and your previous counteroffer. It's a strong negotiating position while still leaving you with a healthy profit margin over John's offer.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""This is my best offer,"" you signal to Bob that this is the limit of your flexibility. This adds pressure for him to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the compromise from your initial price reminds Bob of how far you've come in negotiations, further encouraging him to meet your terms. 

This approach strikes a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob before he walks away or time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting really close. I understand this is a significant compromise for you, and I respect your position. I'm willing to move up slightly to $1,240,000.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now only $60,000 less than your ""final offer"" and a healthy $260,000 above your guaranteed sale to John. While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting this offer secures a very favorable deal for you without jeopardizing the sale entirely."
