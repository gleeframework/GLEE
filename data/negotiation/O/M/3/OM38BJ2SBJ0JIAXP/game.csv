"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, though. How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7250.0,Bob,4,
