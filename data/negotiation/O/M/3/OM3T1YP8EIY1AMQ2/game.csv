"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer, and I'm willing to pay $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,125,000. Considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
