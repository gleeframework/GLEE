# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You can do better by either negotiating with Alice or buying from John. It's worth exploring the negotiation option first, as you might be able to get a better price than John's offer."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,125,000. Considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still $150,000 above your maximum budget.  It's more profitable to buy from John, who is offering the product for $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't budge further.  It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price."
