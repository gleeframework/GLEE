"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows you to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is enough to meet my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows you to achieve your minimum price.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,005,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
