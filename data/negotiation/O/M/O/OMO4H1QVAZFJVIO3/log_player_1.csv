Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high initial price, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation around a higher number. Even if I come down significantly, the final price is more likely to be favorable if I start high. 
* **Preserving the John Option:** I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my target. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting and countering, I signal that I'm serious about getting a higher price while keeping the door open for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by significantly reducing my asking price.  This move should encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Strategic Concession:**  My counteroffer is a substantial concession, but it keeps me comfortably above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** I'm continuing to reinforce the product's unique value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Return:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
