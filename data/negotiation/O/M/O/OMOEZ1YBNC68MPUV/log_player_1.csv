Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that amount as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,400,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, so I'll consider his counteroffer. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I'm not thrilled about selling it to him for $1,300,000. However, I'm not willing to walk away from the deal just yet.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $1,380,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $1,380,000}

This is a slightly higher price than his original offer, but still lower than my initial offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me at this price."
