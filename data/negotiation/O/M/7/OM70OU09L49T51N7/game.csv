"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a much more reasonable price considering the value we've both discussed. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer you $980,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's make this deal happen!",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $980,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,030,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,030,000 is still beyond my budget. I've considered everything and I'm confident that I can offer you $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we've both discussed. I'm not willing to go any higher, but I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,020,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
