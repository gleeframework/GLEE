"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product at that exact price.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer. Since John is also selling the product for the same price, you might as well reject Alice's offer and buy from John.  This creates a scenario where you have more options in the future if another seller emerges with a better price."
