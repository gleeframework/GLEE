(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,300,000.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  It's important to start with a strong offer to show Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product, this counteroffer is his final offer.  It demonstrates Bob's seriousness and willingness to buy the product, but also shows that he's not willing to go any higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,050,000, which is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While further negotiation might be possible,  it's likely that the price won't drop to Bob's desired $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John, who is offering a lower price, rather than continuing a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice."
