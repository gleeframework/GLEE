"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  I'm aiming to pay less than $120, which is the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to do $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is within my budget and still a good deal for her. I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
