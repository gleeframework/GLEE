"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my desired price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  Since I can sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, I'm not in a rush to accept anything lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'll reject it. I have 9 rounds left and I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer this early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is still a decent amount lower than my minimum but it leaves room for further negotiation. I'm aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum.  I have 6 rounds left and can still sell to John for a better price, so I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him. We are getting closer, and I'm hoping to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $875,000 is still lower than my minimum. I have 4 rounds left and can still sell to John for a better price, so I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $925,000.  This is a small increase from my last offer, but I'm hoping that it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  We're getting close to a potential agreement, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 2 rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough.  Since I can sell to John for $1,000,000, it's time to secure that deal.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob in the future, but I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed profit."
