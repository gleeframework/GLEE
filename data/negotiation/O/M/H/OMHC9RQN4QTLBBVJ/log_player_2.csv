"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 limit and what John is offering. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also helps establish a baseline for your budget.
* **Showing Interest:** The message expresses your interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, you're aiming to bring Alice closer to your desired price range, while still leaving yourself space to potentially go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $9,000 is still above your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while staying under your $8,000 limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to close,"" you're signaling a strong desire to buy if you can reach an agreement. 
* **Leaving John as an Option:** You haven't revealed your absolute bottom line, giving you the flexibility to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! While $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500, which is still more expensive than buying from John for $8,000. You've negotiated well, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the better deal with John."
