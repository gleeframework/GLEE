,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to get the product, but $9,800 just isn't working for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,150? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's make this deal happen.",10150.0,Alice,5,
