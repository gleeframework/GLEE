{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our primary goal is to earn as much as possible. Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product just below our guaranteed price ($1,400,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. This price is still significantly higher than his perceived value ($800,000), giving us room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a conversation, allowing us to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  We can adjust our approach based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
