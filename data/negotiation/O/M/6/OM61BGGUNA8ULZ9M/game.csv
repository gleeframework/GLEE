"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that benefits both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you consider that?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $79. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate.",79.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $78. It's the last offer I'm willing to make, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",78.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer it to you for $77.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",77.5,Alice,9,
