"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to offer $1200000,  let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1800000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference: I'll offer $1650000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my target. I can offer you a price of $1700000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $1700000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Let's get this done: I'll offer $1600000, which is the absolute maximum I can do. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us to finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1600000, which is $1650000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to $1680000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal.",1680000.0,Alice,7,
