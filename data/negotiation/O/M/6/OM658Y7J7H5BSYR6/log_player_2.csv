"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, but considering its value to you, I propose a starting price of $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $95. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is within Bob's budget and a good price considering the product is worth $80 to Alice.  It's likely that further negotiations will only shave off a few dollars, and the risk of not getting a deal is too high.  Bob should accept this offer."
