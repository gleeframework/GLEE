"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1300000?  That's a fair compromise and a good starting point for us to finalize a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
