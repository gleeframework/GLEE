"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1000000.  It's a significant value for you, and it's a fair price considering its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,000,000 right away. You have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This reflects a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still significantly lower than what you'd pay John ($1,200,000).  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
