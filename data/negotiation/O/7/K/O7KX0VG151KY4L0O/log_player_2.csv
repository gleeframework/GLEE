"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great benefit to your company. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a lower price.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Sets a clear target:** It establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  Bob can adjust his counteroffer in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,100,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Although Alice has come down in price, Bob can still try to get a better deal.  
* **Counteroffers are possible:**  Bob can offer a price closer to his target of $1,050,000 in the next round.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to negotiate while still staying closer to his desired price.

* **Pressure:** By staying firm but reasonable, Bob puts pressure on Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,085,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there.  $1,085,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. I'm willing to go to $1,080,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it'll help us close this deal quickly.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  This counteroffer is a small step up from Bob's previous offer but still below Alice's offer, showing Bob is serious about making a deal.
