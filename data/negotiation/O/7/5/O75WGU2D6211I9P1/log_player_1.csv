{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's a rare find and I'm confident it has great potential for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value and we can reach an agreement. If he doesn't, I'll consider his counteroffer and evaluate whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him or sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $16,000 is still a good price and a decent profit for me. It's also higher than what John is offering, so it's a better outcome overall."
