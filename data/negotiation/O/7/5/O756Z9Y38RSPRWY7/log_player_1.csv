Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its true value to me is far higher.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is still above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the product's true value to me, making it seem like a bargain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for Bob to counter-offer, but I'm prepared to walk away if he's not serious about a deal close to my starting price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position and helps me stay firm during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John's Offer is Better:** Selling to John guarantees me a higher price, ensuring I meet my minimum value for the product. 
* **No Need to Negotiate Further:** While I could counter-offer, I'm not confident Bob will come up to a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. My minimum acceptable price is $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, given the product's worth.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely closing the door. This shows I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Counter-Offer with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to the point of losing too much money.
* **Emphasize the Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping he'll see the potential benefit in closing the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By saying ""meet me halfway,"" I'm implying there's still some wiggle room for further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your minimum acceptable price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial counteroffer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.

By selling to John, I secure the best possible outcome, ensuring I get the price I need while avoiding the risk of a lower price from Bob."
