This is an opportunity to secure a high-quality item that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations. Should you have any questions or wish to proceed with the purchase, please let me know. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware of the product's value to you and is trying to push your limit. While $10,000 is cheaper than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to lower the price further, closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
