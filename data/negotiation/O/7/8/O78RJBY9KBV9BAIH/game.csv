"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to find a compromise. This reflects my desire to strike a deal while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
