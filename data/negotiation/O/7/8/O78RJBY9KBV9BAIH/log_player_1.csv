"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm position.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob's input and feedback, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is always an option, I have room to negotiate and try to reach a more favorable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to find a compromise. This reflects my desire to strike a deal while acknowledging the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Gradually:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer ($50,000 decrease) but holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark.
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price and avoid appearing overly flexible.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Bob to also move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $950,000 is still too low. I need to hold firm to try and get closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll emphasize that my price is firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've given this a lot of thought, and my final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm price considering the product's true value and my bottom line."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Firm Price:** By stating that $1,000,000 is my ""firm price,"" I'm signaling that I'm not willing to budge any further. 
* **Justified Reasoning:** I'm reiterating the product's value while also mentioning ""my bottom line"" to subtly emphasize the financial constraints from my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt at a compromise. I'm offering $975,000 for the product. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While not ideal, $975,000 is reasonably close to my $1,000,000 target and significantly better than my alternative options.
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob has clearly signaled that this is his maximum price. Pushing further is unlikely to result in a better deal and could lead to losing the sale.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to re-invest or utilize the funds sooner."
