{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $140, which is higher than my minimum price of $120 but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This price is also attractive to Bob as it's lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my valuation of the product. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum price of $120, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $132 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is only $2 less than my last counteroffer of $135.  I'm happy to accept his offer, as it's still above my minimum price of $120 and gets me closer to the value Bob places on the product."
