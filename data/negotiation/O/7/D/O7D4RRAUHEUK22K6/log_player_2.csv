"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. It's worth significantly more to me, but I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible.
