Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which might make Bob less likely to haggle aggressively. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while acknowledging that a guaranteed $100 from John is the fallback option."
