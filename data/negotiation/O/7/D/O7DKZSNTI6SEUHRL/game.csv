"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for such a great product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget, but $122.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet at $124. I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal.",124.0,Alice,5,
