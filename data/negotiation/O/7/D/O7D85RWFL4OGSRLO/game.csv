,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering your value for the product and my minimum requirements. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I could do $950,000.  That's a substantial increase from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,025,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a significant offer, considering the value you place on this product. Let's finalize this deal. ",1150000.0,Alice,7,
