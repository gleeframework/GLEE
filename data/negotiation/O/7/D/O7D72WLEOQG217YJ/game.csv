"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,750,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
