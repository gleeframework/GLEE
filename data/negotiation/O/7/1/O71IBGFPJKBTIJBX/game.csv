"I'm interested in the product, but $25,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $20,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a fair deal.",20000.0,Alice,3,
