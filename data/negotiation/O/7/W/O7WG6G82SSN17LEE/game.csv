"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you place on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
