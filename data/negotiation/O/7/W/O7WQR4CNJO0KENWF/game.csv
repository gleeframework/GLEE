"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet me closer to the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer on the price, Alice.  While I see its value, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,025,000?  This offer reflects the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
