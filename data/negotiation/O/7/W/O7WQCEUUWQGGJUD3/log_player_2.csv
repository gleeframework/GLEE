"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** My goal is to get the product for significantly less than John's $1,000,000 offer. Aiming for $800,000 seems like a good starting point to see how much Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $800,000 is below what I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to John's price. There's no point in negotiating further as I won't get a better deal from Alice.  It's time to buy from John."
