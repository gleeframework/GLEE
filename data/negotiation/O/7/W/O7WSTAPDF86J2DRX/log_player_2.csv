Alice's offer:

This price still reflects the value of the product and its potential benefits for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Considering the product's value and our back and forth, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000.  This price allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?
