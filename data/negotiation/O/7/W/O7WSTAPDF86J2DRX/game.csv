"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20000. This price reflects the quality and potential benefits of the product.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm offering $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work.  This price still reflects the value of the product and its potential benefits for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $17000 is closer, I'm still capped at $8000.  If you're open to it, let's meet in the middle at $9000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000.  However, to be honest, that's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Considering the product's value and our back and forth, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000.  This price allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
