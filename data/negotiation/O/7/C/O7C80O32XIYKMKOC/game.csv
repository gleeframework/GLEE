I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair offer that is closer to both of our desired prices. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement at this point.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
