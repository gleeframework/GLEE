"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it has potential. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would that be workable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can do $810,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
