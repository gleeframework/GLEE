Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and while I have another buyer interested at $800,000, I'm confident its true worth is greater.  I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This gives you a chance to secure it before it goes elsewhere, and recognizes its potential beyond the standard market value. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 875000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Competition:** By mentioning John's offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob knows he's not the only interested party.
* **Value Justification:** We don't just throw out a high number; we frame it as recognizing the product's ""true worth"" and ""potential beyond the standard market.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the tone remains open for discussion. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to still land above $800,000. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** We want to maintain a good relationship even if Bob declines, as future business opportunities are always possible."
