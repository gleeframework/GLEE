"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer $800,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
