"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $9,500. This means she's aiming for a significant profit. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of us.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.**  By rejecting, I can try to bring the price down to a more reasonable level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original price. Would you consider $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has lowered the price slightly, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I can aim for a price closer to $9,000, potentially finding a compromise.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  By rejecting, I keep the pressure on Alice to lower the price."
