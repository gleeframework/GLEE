"Hi Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  Perhaps we can meet somewhere in the middle? How about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500?  I'm really interested in this product and am willing to make a deal if we can find a price that's fair.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for sticking with me on this. I'm eager to get this product in your hands, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
