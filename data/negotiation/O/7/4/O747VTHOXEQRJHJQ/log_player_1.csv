"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and makes any concessions you make seem more significant. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level, justifying the high initial price.

This first offer is a strategic starting point.  We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value ($1,000,000), it's still significantly lower than both our desired selling price and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and can likely reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a competitive offer, reflecting the unique advantages this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial concession ($300,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his range.
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're still holding firm well above Bob's offer and our minimum price. The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's flexibility and helps us understand if a mutually beneficial agreement is within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer of $1,500,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. While we started higher, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better result. Accepting this offer ensures we get our minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
