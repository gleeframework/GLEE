"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This price reflects the value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
