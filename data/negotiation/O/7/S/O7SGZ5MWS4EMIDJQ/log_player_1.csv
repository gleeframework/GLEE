"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives us room to negotiate down while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob's input and aiming to understand his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This price reflects the value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my target and even further from his own perceived value. While it's above my absolute minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing $1,100,000, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and my previous price ($1,300,000). 
* **Strong Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition and highlighting that my counteroffer is a compromise aimed at a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  While willing to negotiate, I'm holding firm above the $1 million mark to ensure a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong price and represents a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob could walk away or become less willing to negotiate. It's a good deal, and I'll accept to secure the sale."
