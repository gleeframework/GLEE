Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Win-Win Mindset:** I'm framing the offer as a potential win-win situation to encourage negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. While I'm aiming for the highest possible price, I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000. This gives me flexibility throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, his offer is simply too low. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but still consider Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a significant value for you, and I believe we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to compromise. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum but still represents a significant discount from my initial offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to reinforce the benefit of accepting the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer closer to my desired price, I'm attempting to find a balance between maximizing my profits and reaching a deal with Bob. This approach could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $700,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial financial loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but I'll also consider the fact that John is willing to buy the product for $1,000,000.  This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the product's value.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best deal we can achieve. If we don't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating that $700,000 is unacceptable, but I'm also offering a compromise with a price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Alternative Options:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob at a price that's closer to my minimum. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a safety net while still trying to secure a better price with Bob."
