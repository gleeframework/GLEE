"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,500. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal today.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,900. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",8900.0,Alice,5,
