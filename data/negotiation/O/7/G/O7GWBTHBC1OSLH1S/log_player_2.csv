"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but her offer is $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the process.**  There are 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps you in control.**  By rejecting, you force Alice to come down in price or risk losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,500. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has come down from $9,500, it's still higher than your ideal price. 
* **You have time to negotiate.** You are only in Round 3, so there's still room for more back-and-forth. 
* **You can try to get a better price.**  By rejecting her offer, you can try to get Alice to lower her price even further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal today."", ""product_price"": 8750}
