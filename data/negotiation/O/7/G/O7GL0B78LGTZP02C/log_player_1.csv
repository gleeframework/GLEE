"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a little more.  How about $110?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to get a better price.  How about $107?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $107 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107 is just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $109? It's a fair price and we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
