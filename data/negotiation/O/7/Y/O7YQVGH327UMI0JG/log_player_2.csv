You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less than $12,000, and it's worth more to you than $15,000.  By rejecting the offer, you can start negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You should accept Alice's offer.  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is now offering it to you for $11,500, which is a good deal for you.  You can save $3,500 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
