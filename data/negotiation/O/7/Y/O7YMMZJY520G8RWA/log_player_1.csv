Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is above your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still negotiate up if Bob is willing.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $1,450,000 is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's responses and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept it, you stand to gain more by continuing negotiations.  

Here's why rejecting the offer makes sense:

* **You can get a better price:**  You have room to negotiate upwards, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **You have a backup:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price, and you open the door for a more profitable negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's significantly higher than Bob's offer of $1,100,000, showing you're not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product.
* **Lower than your original offer:** It's lower than your initial offer of $1,450,000, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit.

By sending this counteroffer, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a position that's fair and profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not willing to go as low as $1,100,000, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **It meets your minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly your minimum acceptable price.  
* **It's a fair price:**  While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the negotiations have gone on for a few rounds already.  
* **No risk involved:**  You're not taking a risk by accepting. You're getting your desired price, and you avoid the potential of further negotiation with Bob or the uncertainty of selling to John. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a profitable deal while minimizing the time and effort spent in negotiations."
