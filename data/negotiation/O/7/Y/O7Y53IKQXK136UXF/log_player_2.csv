"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you will likely be much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my budget of $8,000.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is still a bit higher than your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target, $11,500 is still outside my ideal price range. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to land at a price closer to my budget. How about $10,500?  I'm confident this price reflects the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her offers are still above my budget.  While I'm confident I could potentially get her to accept $10,500 with a few more rounds, I'm running out of time.  I'm also concerned that continuing to push her could make her unwilling to sell at all. 

It's time to secure the product. John's offer of $8,000 is a much better deal than the $11,000 Alice is currently offering.  I'll take John's offer to ensure I get the product within my budget."
