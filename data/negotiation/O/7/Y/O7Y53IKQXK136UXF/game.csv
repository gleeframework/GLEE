"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you will likely be much higher. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10000 is still a bit higher than your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11500 is closer, I'm still hoping to land at a price closer to my budget. How about $10500?  I'm confident this price reflects the value we both place on the product.",10500.0,Bob,6,
