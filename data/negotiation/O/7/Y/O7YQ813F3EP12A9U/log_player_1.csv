Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this presents a fair deal, especially considering the benefits it holds for you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice the opportunity to reduce the price slightly and still secure a higher profit than she would get from John.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value, aiming to nudge Bob closer to accepting the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a strong backup option with John, ensuring she won't be forced to sell below her minimum."
