"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm looking for $1,200,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
