This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $900,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum ($800,000) and demonstrates a successful negotiation.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has consistently shown interest and is willing to meet in the middle, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even push Bob away. Accepting now capitalizes on the positive momentum."
