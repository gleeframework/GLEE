"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm asking for $950,000.  This leaves significant room for you to make a profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,
