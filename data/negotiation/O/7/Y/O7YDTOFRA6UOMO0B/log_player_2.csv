Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller.  $825,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $375,000 compared to John's offer."
