"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Would you be willing to consider that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $92.50, which would be $88.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I want to make this work. However, $88.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $90? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me there?",87.5,Bob,6,
