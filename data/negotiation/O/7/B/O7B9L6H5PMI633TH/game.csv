"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
