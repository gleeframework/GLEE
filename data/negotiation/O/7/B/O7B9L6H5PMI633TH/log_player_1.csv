Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
