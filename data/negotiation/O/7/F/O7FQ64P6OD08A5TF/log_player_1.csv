``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is higher than my minimum but allows for some negotiation space. I'm also framing the offer as fair and encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $18000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $18,000 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $19,000?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $19000 is slightly above my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm going to try to see if I can get him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $18,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it lets us both get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose $18000 as a compromise. This price is within my budget and still reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $18,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure the deal at a price I'm comfortable with than risk losing the sale entirely."
