Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. This can help build a rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can counter with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than that.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.  It's also a good way to test Bob's commitment to buying the product. If he's serious, he might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product. I'm suggesting a ""middle ground"" to encourage him to agree.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. If Bob is serious about buying the product, he might be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,750? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. I don't want to risk going lower and potentially ending up with a lower profit than what John is offering. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get a bit more,  it's not worth risking a lower sale to Bob, especially if he might continue to negotiate down."
