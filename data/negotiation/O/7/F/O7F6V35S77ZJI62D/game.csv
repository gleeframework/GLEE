"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $98. It's only a few dollars more, and it gets us closer to a deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,6,
