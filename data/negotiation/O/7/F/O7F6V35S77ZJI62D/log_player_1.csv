"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe it's worth to me, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $98. It's only a few dollars more, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffers are getting increasingly less appealing.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance I won't be able to reach my minimum price of $100.  Since John is offering me my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation."
