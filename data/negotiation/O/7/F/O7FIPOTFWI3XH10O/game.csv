"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to make a small compromise, though. I can offer you a slight discount, bringing the price down to $127.50. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",127.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $127.50 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm ready to make a deal at this price.",120.0,Bob,6,
