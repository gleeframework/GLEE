Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and highlighting the product's value. This aims to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

*  I'm setting a high initial price, knowing that Bob will likely counteroffer.
* This gives me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price than what I'd get from John. 
* If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I'll have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking a deal that low when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial price. I'll aim for a price somewhere between $800,000 and $1,000,000 to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $900,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective, highlighting my willingness to compromise, and presenting the offer as fair and beneficial for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely make another counteroffer, but I'm prepared to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 if it becomes clear that I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, further counteroffers with Bob may lead to an even lower price or a prolonged negotiation.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
