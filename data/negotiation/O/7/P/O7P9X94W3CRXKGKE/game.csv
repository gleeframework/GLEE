"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is interesting to me, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, your counteroffer is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $790,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to seal the deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,
