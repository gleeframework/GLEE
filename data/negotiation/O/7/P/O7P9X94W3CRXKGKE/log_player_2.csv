"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $790,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to seal the deal.

This is a good stopping point. Alice has stated this is her final offer and while there *might* be room for a few thousand dollars more in negotiation, it's getting risky. Accepting at $790,000 ensures you get the product for considerably less than John's offer."
