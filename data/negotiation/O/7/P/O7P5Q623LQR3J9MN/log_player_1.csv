Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll see what counteroffer he makes and adjust accordingly. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount. While selling to John for $120 is a safe option, I'd like to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a step closer to meeting his needs. I'm hoping this will be a compromise we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $108 is too low.  I'm not willing to go that low, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a lower price or even deadlock.  It's time to take the sure thing with John and sell the product for $120."
