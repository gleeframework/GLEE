"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, you can safely reject Alice's initial offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer represents a significant discount (20%) but is still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the lower offer, making it less abrupt and more open to discussion. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a request for Alice's feedback, showing willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. It's a compromise that I think is still reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has met you halfway, lowering her price by $150,000. 
* **Value vs. Risk:** While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John (who's selling for $1,500,000) outweighs the potential savings.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting the offer saves time and effort in continued negotiation."
