"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. It's a compromise that I think is still reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
