Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so we need to offer it at a price that's beneficial to him but still profitable for us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $14,500, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price slightly lower, but still significantly higher than our guaranteed $15,000 from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
