"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You are better off rejecting Alice's offer.  You can get the product from John for the same price. Since you want to save money, there's no benefit to buying from Alice."
