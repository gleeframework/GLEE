Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Starting High:** It's generally beneficial to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how eager he is to buy it. 
* **Fallback Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Since he immediately countered with your absolute bottom line, he's likely willing to pay a bit more. You'll reject his offer to signal that you're looking for a higher price and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and aims to find a compromise that works for both parties.
* **Profitable:** $125 is still a significant profit above your minimum price.
* **Pressure:** By suggesting a middle ground, you apply a bit of pressure on Bob to potentially increase his offer or accept the current one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob has countered twice now with the same price, $100, which is your minimum acceptable amount.  It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting ensures you make the sale and don't risk losing out entirely by pushing for a slightly higher price that Bob might not agree to.
* **John as Backup:** While John offers the same amount, there's always a slight chance he might find another deal. Accepting Bob's offer eliminates that risk."
