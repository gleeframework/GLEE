"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a lower price. Consider this a chance to acquire a truly exceptional asset.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
