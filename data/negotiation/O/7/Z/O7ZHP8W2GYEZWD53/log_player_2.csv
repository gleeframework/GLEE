"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  There's room to save some money before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and interested:**  We want to keep the negotiation friendly and show Alice we're serious about the product.
* **Significant counteroffer:** Starting with $90 puts us in a good position to potentially meet in the middle, aiming for a price closer to $100.
* **Open to negotiation:**  We haven't anchored ourselves to $90, leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Great Deal:**  $97.5 is a very good price, saving us $22.5 compared to John's offer and exceeding our goal of staying under $120.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has clearly demonstrated a willingness to negotiate by meeting us halfway. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Pushing for a slightly lower price might backfire and make Alice less willing to negotiate, potentially leading to us losing out on a good deal."
