It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance you can get Alice to come down from $6,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal range while still being reasonable. This will give me a good starting point for negotiation."

While $6,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still hopeful to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again to try to push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying significantly below Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $5,700 is getting closer to my desired price, and with only 5 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing out to John."
