"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to make it available at this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  $800,000 is a significant discount, but it's still above your ideal price. 
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** This is a good option if negotiations fail, but you're not desperate to buy right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  This is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still within the range where a deal is possible.
* **Focused on value:**  The message emphasizes that you're seeking a price that makes the product more appealing to you.
* **Opens the door for negotiation:**  This counteroffer is a starting point for back-and-forth negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  She met you halfway, and $750,000 is a significant discount from her original offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  You only have 10 rounds, and rejecting this offer could lead to more back-and-forth that might not be fruitful.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John, so there's no urgency to push for a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It secures the product at a favorable price and leaves you with time and resources for other potential opportunities."
