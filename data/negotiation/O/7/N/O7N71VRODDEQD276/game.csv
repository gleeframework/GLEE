"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that low. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
