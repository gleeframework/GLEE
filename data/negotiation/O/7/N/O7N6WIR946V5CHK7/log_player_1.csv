Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,999 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, giving Alice a chance to secure a deal above her minimum.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:**  While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, a quicker sale to Bob avoids potential delays and uncertainties.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
