"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $5,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This would be a good price for both of us, and we could finalize the sale quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your effort.  However, $7,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's in your best interest to take John's offer and save the extra $500."
