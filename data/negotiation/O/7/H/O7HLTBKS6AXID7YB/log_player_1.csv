Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I'm confident I can negotiate a fair price with him. I'll keep the option of selling to John for $15,000 in mind as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'll reject it. I will counteroffer with a higher price to try and find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is still higher than what I'm willing to sell to John for, but it's lower than my initial offer. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $15,000.  I'll choose to sell to John to guarantee the highest possible profit."
