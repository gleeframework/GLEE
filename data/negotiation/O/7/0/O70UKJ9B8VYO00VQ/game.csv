"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value we're offering.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $550,000? I think that's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm thinking of a price around $650,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600,000 to find a compromise.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing you a fair profit.",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm thinking of a price around $675,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a decent profit. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $675,000 is a bit too high for me. To be completely transparent, I've got another offer on the table.  However, I'd prefer to work with you. Would you be willing to settle at $625,000?  That's my final offer.",625000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about having another offer on the table. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $625,000. I'm thinking of a price around $650,000.
