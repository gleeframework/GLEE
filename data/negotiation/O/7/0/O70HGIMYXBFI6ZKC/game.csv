"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still a good value for you considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's close this deal!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the value I place on the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to close the deal without either of us losing money. Let's finalize this now.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
