Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, leaving room for negotiation but still reflecting the product's significant value to me.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I emphasize the product's value to him, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $900,000 is above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it.
* **Maintaining my fallback option:**  If Bob rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is my best offer, considering I can purchase the same product from John for $800000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your business, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price in the middle of our current offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, implying that this is a good deal for him.
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm suggesting a sense of urgency to encourage a quick decision.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $875,000 is still above my $1,000,000 minimum, ensuring I don't lose too much if Bob rejects.

**This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially finalize the deal with Bob while keeping the option to sell to John open if necessary.**"
