"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is my best offer, considering I can purchase the same product from John for $800000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your business, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
