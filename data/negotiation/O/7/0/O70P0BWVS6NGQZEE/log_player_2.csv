Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value your business, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.
