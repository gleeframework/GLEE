{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but it's also more than Bob's estimated value ($800,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you room to make a profit. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. How about $900,000? That's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'll make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $887,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $882,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not sure how much further I can go without compromising too much.  I've already lost a significant amount of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,000,000."
