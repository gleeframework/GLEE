"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is at the maximum limit, it's best to reject the offer and see if a better price can be negotiated. There's no harm in trying to get a lower price, as you can always buy from John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $9,000. This is a 25% reduction from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and it leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter back, but this gives us a starting point for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than my initial counteroffer, but still significantly better than her original price. Accepting this offer allows me to save $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome or exhausting the rounds."
