"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $12,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
