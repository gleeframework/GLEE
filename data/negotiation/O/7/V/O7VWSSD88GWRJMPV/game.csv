"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $950,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $700,000? If that works for you, I'm ready to move forward.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $700,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this item.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more frugal. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a firm offer from my side.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be frugal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
