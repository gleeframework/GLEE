"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  If we can't agree, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no further. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,6,
