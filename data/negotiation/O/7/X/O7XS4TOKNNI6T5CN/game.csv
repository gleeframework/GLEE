,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,100,000? This still leaves a good profit margin for you and allows me to recoup some of my costs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
