"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $150. How about $155?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it offers.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue discussing this.  $130 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. How about $140? That way we both get a good deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
