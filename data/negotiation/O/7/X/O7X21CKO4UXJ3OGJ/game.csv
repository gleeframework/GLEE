"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $19,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
