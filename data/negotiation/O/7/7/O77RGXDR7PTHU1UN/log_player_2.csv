{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000. This is a bold move but shows Bob's determination to secure a favorable price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob can still try to push for a better deal. He's willing to pay more than $1,200,000, but not $1,300,000.  By rejecting the offer, he maintains leverage and signals his willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer provides a reasonable middle ground that could be accepted."
