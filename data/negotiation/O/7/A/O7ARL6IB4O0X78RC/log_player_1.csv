``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows for some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially adjust mine accordingly.  However, I'm always prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I don't feel I'm getting a good enough deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can push him closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer to stay within my budget, I am willing to consider $925,000 as a counteroffer. This allows us to move closer to a mutually agreeable price while still keeping my financial constraints in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial asking price and represents a significant profit for me, especially considering his initial offer of $800,000. While I'd prefer to push for more, I don't want to risk losing him and having to sell to John for only $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows for a quick and profitable sale."
