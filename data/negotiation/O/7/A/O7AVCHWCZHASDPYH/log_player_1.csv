{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you while still allowing me a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While $9,000 is still a bit below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable offer and significantly better than selling to John.  I'll take the offer and move on."
