"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider purchasing this item at a special introductory price of $12,000. We understand its value to you is $8,000, but we hope this offer presents an opportunity for mutual benefit.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introduction, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $9,000. Our product is valued at $15,000 due to its unique features and quality. However, considering our current negotiation, I am willing to discuss a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to $10,500? This still allows for a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a significant step from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
