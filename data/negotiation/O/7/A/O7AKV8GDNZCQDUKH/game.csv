"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $200 again. However, I'll throw in a special bonus with the purchase, which I think will be worth at least $20 to you. So, the total value you'll be getting is $220. Can you consider that?",200.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $180 before, Bob, and I'm not willing to go lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional bonus, worth at least $30, on top of the previous offer. So, the total value you'll be getting is $230. Can you reconsider?",200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional bonus you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $200. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is my maximum budget for this product. If you can meet me there, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",120.0,Bob,10,
