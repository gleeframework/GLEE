"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something you'll find extremely valuable, and I know you'll get great use out of it.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This price reflects the unique value it brings, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,150,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to manage my finances better.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am willing to increase my offer to $1,225,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's worth. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
