{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point, aiming for a price slightly higher than my minimum but leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's still close. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still being attractive to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $108.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's counteroffer of $108 is above my minimum, and it seems like we're getting closer to an agreement.  It's a good balance between maximizing profit and avoiding the risk of a further negotiation breakdown or having to sell to John for $100."
