"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable to your operations.  My initial price is $900000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $850000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This would still allow me to cover my costs and leave a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. How about we aim for $860000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
