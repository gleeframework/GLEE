Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's truly interested and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price if there's a chance I can get more. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than my minimum but shows willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems to be firm on his price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  I've already lowered my price once and still didn't get a better counteroffer.  Rather than risk further negotiations that might end up with me getting my minimum price, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. It's guaranteed money and will save me further negotiation time."
