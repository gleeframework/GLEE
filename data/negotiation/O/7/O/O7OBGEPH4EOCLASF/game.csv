"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? That's still a great deal for a product this valuable.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. That's a fair price, and it's what I'd pay from another seller.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
