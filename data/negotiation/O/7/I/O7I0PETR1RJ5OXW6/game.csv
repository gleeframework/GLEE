"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer, which would be $11000. I think this is a fair price for the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $10500. This is still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and features you'll receive.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10200.0,Alice,7,
