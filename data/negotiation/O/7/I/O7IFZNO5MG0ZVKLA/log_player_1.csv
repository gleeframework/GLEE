Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a fair deal given its potential worth in the right hands. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price ($1,000,000).

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no further information about Bob's negotiating style or any other factors that might influence his decision."
