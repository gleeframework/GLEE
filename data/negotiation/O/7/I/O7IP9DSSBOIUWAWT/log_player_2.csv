"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is a great price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still a significant portion of your $15,000 budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing. There are still 9 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a lower price.  While $8000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still get a great deal on this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,000, which shows a willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my target of $8,000.  With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to see if I can get a better offer from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9,000 is getting closer to my range, but I'm still hoping to finalize a deal at $8,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
