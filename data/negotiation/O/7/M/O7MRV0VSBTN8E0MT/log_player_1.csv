Bob is becoming increasingly insistent on a low price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not the best possible outcome, but it's still a fair price and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob."
