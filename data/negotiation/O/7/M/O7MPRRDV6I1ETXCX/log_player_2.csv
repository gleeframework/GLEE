"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique and highly valuable product to you. This item holds significant worth for me at $15,000, but considering its potential value to you, I believe it could be an excellent investment. I am offering this product to you for $12,000, which I hope strikes a fair balance between the intrinsic value of the product and my desire to see it go to someone who appreciates it fully. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if there's any other way I can assist you in making a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly less than buying from John.  It's a good deal that saves you money."
