{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong starting point, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I have 8 rounds left and am confident I can push for a higher price."

```

I'm counteroffering at $1,775,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and a compromise, acknowledging his stance but still aiming for a higher price. It's a risky move, but with three rounds remaining, I'm trying to push for the best possible outcome."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're down to two rounds, and while I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, I risk losing the deal entirely if I keep pushing. $1,650,000 is still a good profit, and I don't want to risk ending up with only John's offer."
