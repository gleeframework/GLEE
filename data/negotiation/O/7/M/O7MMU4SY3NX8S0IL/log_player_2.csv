"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and still saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or even withdraw the offer.
* Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is within Bob's budget and a reasonable deal."
