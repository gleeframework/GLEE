"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer to sweeten the deal. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential for a quick sale.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. $16,000 is closer, but I'm really looking to stay around $14,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay around $14,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $15,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
