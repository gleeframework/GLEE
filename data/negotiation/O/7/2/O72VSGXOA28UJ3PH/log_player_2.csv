"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still too high. I want to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate shows there's room for compromise. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject the first offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $950,000. Let's settle on $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for further compromise.  
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 7 rounds remaining, which gives me enough time to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
