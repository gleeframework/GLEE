"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great price, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your decision by [date/time]. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure a better deal, saving $250,000."
