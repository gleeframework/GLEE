"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He can get the product from John for $10,000, so he's not willing to pay more than that.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's target price.  Therefore, he should reject the offer and try to get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  I'm still only willing to pay $10,500 for the product. That's my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $10700. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already stated his final offer of $10,500. Alice has come down to $10,700, which is still higher than Bob's target price. Bob is not willing to pay more than $10,500.  Instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving him $700 compared to Alice's final offer."
