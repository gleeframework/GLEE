Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value to give Bob some room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This is still a great deal for you and closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $85, Alice. While that's closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could we do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100 and is significantly better than selling to John for $100. Accepting this offer is the best choice in this situation."
