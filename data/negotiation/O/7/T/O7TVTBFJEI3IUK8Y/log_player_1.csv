Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.

While $1,175,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to negotiate further but need to ensure I get a price closer to $1,200,000."
