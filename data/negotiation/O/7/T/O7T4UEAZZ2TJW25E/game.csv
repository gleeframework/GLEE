"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
