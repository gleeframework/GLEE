{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $850,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 250,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to come down in price. I'm leaving room for negotiation and still have a comfortable buffer below my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to try and get closer to my target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer by 50,000, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm still pushing for a better deal. This is a moderate increase that could potentially sway Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down slowly, but I'm still within a comfortable range of my maximum price. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, this time by 50,000.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this counteroffer shows that I'm also serious about reaching a deal. The price is still significantly lower than my maximum, and I'm confident that Alice might be persuaded."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $715,000, which is getting close to my desired price range.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or me needing to buy from John at a higher price increases with each round. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price, and with only 3 rounds left, the potential savings don't justify the risk of further negotiation."
