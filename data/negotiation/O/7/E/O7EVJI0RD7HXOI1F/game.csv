"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  It's closer, but I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise from my original position, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll receive.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
