Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Any offer above this is a loss for him.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim as close to $1,000,000 as possible without alienating Bob. Here's an approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm offering it at a premium price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confidence and Exclusivity:** The message positions the product as high-value and the opportunity as exclusive.
* **Strong Opening Price:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, while still staying well above your minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, reject outright, or try to negotiate you down further.
* **Your Alternatives:**  Remember, you have John as a backup. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offer is too low."
