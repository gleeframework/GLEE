"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
