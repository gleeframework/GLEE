"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also taking into account your concerns about the price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $850,000 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm prepared to pay $800,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $800,000. I'm offering you $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
