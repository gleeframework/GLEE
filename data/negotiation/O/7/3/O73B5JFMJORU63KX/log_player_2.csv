"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this game-changing technology at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He wants to pay less than $800,000, and Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also taking into account your concerns about the price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $850,000 is closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better deal.  He can try to push Alice closer to his desired price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $850,000 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm prepared to pay $800,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $800,000. I'm offering you $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice has shown that she's willing to come down, but she's not budging much further.  While the price from Alice is close to his target, it's still a bit higher than what he's willing to pay.  John is offering the product for his ideal price, so it's best to secure the deal with him."
