Alice is clearly trying to push the price as close to her value as possible. While we could try to negotiate further, her language suggests this is her final offer and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $8,100 ensures we get a decent deal without risking the negotiation falling through and having to pay John's higher price."
