Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept your offer at $700,000. Our current asking price is $950,000, but I would like to make a compromise. How about we discuss a price of $850,000? This still represents a significant saving for you compared to the product's intrinsic value, while also providing a more reasonable profit margin for us.
