Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum price of $100, so you'll be making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $115 is below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not overly aggressive, giving Bob the opportunity to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

If Bob rejects, you can then gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You haven't lost much by rejecting his offer.
* **Potentially get a better price:**  You can counter with a price closer to your desired $115.  Bob's initial counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference? I can do $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate and come down from your initial price.
* **Offers a compromise:**  $110 is halfway between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Keeps you closer to your desired price:**  You're still making a profit, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about $108? That's a bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Closing the deal:**  Bob is getting closer to your desired price, and further negotiation might take longer and be less likely to result in a significantly higher offer.
* **Profit over potential:**  While you might be able to get $110, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away or a prolonged negotiation.  $108 is still a good profit for you.
* **Time is money:**  You could also sell to John, but selling to Bob now secures a higher price and potentially saves you time."
