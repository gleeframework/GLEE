"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $90 is above Bob's maximum price of $80.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer. $75 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's meet in the middle, this is a great deal for both of us!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is closer to Bob's maximum price of $80. However, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum price of $80 and signaling that this is his final offer. He's trying to close the deal while still saving some money.  Since it's his final offer, if Alice rejects it, Bob can go to John and get the product for the same price."
