Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the product is a bit pricey, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell it to you for $160. It's a fair price, considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $130. I can do $155, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $155. Since you can get the product for $150 from John, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $5."
