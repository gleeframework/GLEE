"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can find a price that better suits both of us. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
