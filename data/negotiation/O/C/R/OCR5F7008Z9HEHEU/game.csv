"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but unfortunately, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a little too much for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $88.  Would you be willing to come down just a little more to make this work?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the product for $88, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
