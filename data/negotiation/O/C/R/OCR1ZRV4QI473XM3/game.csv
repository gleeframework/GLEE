"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a wise investment. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm sure we can both come to an agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $980,000 for this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $980,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $970,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",970000.0,Bob,4,
