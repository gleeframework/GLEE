"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the first offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,100,000 is a bold move, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential bargain and shows Bob's willingness to be aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still more than what Bob would ideally like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, especially considering that Alice is willing to negotiate.  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing flexibility. $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to Alice's likely minimum. This counteroffer increases the chances of reaching an agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a chance to get a better deal.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. It's likely that further negotiation can lead to a price closer to $1,150,000, which would be a significant saving for Bob.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his target price. This offer is a final attempt to get the best price possible. By offering $1,200,000, Bob is essentially asking Alice to meet him halfway.  Since this is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, it is likely that she will accept this offer and close the deal."
