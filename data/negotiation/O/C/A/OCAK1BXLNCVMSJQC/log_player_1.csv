Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase the product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting at $16,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests willingness to negotiate.  This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer, even if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice has any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), she might adjust her approach accordingly.
* **Market Conditions:**  If similar products are readily available at lower prices, Alice might need to be more conservative.
* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term business relationship with Bob, she might be willing to accept a smaller profit margin to secure the deal."
