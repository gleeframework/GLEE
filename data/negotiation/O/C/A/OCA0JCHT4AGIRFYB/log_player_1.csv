Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its value to both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. There's no need to go below that price."
