"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your desire for a lower price, $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still provides you with a great value, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's work together to find a solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
