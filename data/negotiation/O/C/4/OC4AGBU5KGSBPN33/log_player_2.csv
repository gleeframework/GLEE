Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,450,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However,  $1,400,000 is still a little below where I need to be. I'm prepared to accept $1,425,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of this product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a reasonable saving compared to John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
