"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,550,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,450,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to bump up my offer to $1,400,000.  Let's wrap this up.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However,  $1,400,000 is still a little below where I need to be. I'm prepared to accept $1,425,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of this product.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
