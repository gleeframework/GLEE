"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $12000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $10000. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
