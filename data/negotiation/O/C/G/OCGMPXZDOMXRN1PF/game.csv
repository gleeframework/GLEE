"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair and mutually beneficial.  Let's discuss a price of $1,150,000.  This allows you to still realize significant value while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
