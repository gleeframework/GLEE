Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $950,000 to see if we can find common ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as I have a higher valuation for the product than he does."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to show my commitment to finding a deal. Let's split the difference and see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of securing a more favorable price, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  I'll see if I can get Bob closer to my desired range before deciding if it's worth taking the guaranteed deal with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $875,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000 as a final compromise. This price is still significantly below what I'd like to get, but it shows I'm determined to make this deal happen.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offers have been consistently lower than what I'm willing to accept. With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob is increasing.  Given that I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's the most sensible decision at this point to secure that guaranteed profit.  It's better to secure a known value than risk losing a potentially better deal with Bob."
