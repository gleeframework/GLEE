Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price between $80 and $150 allows for profit. Setting the price closer to Bob's valuation ($150) maximizes your potential earnings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is a strong starting point, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than your minimum while still making it appealing enough for Bob to accept."
