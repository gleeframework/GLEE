"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's price of $120. However, you can still do better! By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller offering a better deal."
