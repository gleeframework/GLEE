Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's  above my minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable and hopefully be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum price of $80, and it seems like he's serious about buying.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in a slightly higher price, so accepting his offer seems like the best option to secure the sale and maximize my earnings."
