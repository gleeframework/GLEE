"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but $8250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8400.  It's a small compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8200. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're working with a budget, but $8200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $8300. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",8300.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8150, but no more than that. I really like the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8150.0,Bob,8,
