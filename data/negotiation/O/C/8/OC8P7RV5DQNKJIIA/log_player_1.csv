"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before accepting his offer or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,250 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,400.  It's a small compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8200. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

While $8,200 is close to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can convince him to raise his offer slightly before I settle or sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you're working with a budget, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $8,300.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8150, but no more than that. I really like the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,150 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we're down to the final rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'm confident that I can get my asking price from John, so I'll sell the product to him."
