Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating it, the message hints at the product's value and the potential for others to be interested (""before I open it up to other buyers"").
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $16,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a secure offer from John at $12,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could adjust the initial offer based on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's desire for the product."
