Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I value your willingness to negotiate, but $675,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm ready to pay $660,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $660000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $680000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $680,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, I'm realizing that I may not be able to get a much lower offer. I'm only a few rounds away from having to buy from John at a much higher price. 

* **Risk:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Alice getting tired of negotiating and walking away. I could then end up having to buy from John for a much higher price.
* **Opportunity:**  Even though it's not my ideal price, $680,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer. 

Therefore, accepting this offer is the most strategic decision at this point. It minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal and ensures I get the product at a price that's within my budget."
