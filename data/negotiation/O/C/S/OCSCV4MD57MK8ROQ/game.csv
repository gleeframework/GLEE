"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800000 is slightly out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it, considering the potential value it brings.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $650000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair offer.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I value your willingness to negotiate, but $675000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm ready to pay $660000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the significant progress we've made.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.",660000.0,Bob,6,
