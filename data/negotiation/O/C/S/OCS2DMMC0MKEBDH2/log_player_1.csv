"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Bob is interested in the product, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still a bit higher than $9,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  I'm confident this product is worth it for you at this price. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I am still willing to negotiate further.  I have 6 more rounds and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiations and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,400.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you $9,200 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $9,200 is only slightly higher than his previous offer of $9,250.  It's clear that we're at an impasse, and I'm not confident that I can get much more from Bob even with the remaining rounds.  Selling the product to John for $12,000 is the most profitable option at this point, guaranteeing me a much higher return than I can currently get from Bob."
