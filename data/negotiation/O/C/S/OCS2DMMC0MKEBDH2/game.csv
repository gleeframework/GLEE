"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still a bit higher than $9,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  I'm confident this product is worth it for you at this price. ",9500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,400.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you $9,200 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",9200.0,Bob,6,
