# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($15,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 while still fulfilling your goal of buying the product."
