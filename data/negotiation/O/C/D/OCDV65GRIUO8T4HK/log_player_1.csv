Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still secures a price very close to your desired amount. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start higher, going just below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob more likely to accept."
