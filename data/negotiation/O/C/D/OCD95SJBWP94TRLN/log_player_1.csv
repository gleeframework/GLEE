You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a profit.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500}
