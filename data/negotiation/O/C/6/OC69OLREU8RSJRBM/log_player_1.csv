``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It's important to start strong to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a good amount, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little. How about $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
