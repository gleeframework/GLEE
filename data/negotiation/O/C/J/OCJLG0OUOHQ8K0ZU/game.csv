"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my initial offer. How about $90? It's still a great price for this product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82? That's the lowest I can go.",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $82 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $86? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",86.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $86 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $86, which would be $84. Can you consider that?",84.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $84 is still not quite enough for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise.  How about $88? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",88.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,8,
