"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still outside of his comfortable range. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to stay under $8,000.  Would you consider $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep talking."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final concession, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is a better price than previous offers, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've been flexible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to prioritize my own needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has stated that $13,000 is her absolute minimum, and while it is tempting to try to negotiate, there are only 3 rounds left.  It's highly unlikely that Bob will be able to convince Alice to drop below $13,000, and he's already stated that he wants to stay under $8,000.  It's a better use of his time and resources to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $8,000."
