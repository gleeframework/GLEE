"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to stay under $8,000.  Would you consider $11,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep talking.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final concession, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise and allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to prioritize my own needs.",13000.0,Alice,7,
