"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the price you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it provides for me. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer, as it's your maximum budget. It's a direct, clear message to Alice stating your final price point. You've emphasized its fairness and mutual benefit, hoping to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than your budget. You have already made your final offer, and it was rejected. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John for $800,000, as you've already demonstrated your willingness to pay that amount. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could risk running out of rounds and being forced to buy at a higher price."
