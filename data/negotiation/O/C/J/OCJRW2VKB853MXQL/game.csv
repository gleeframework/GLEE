"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the price you're willing to pay.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it provides for me. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows us both to get what we want.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
