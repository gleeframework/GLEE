I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's high enough to be attractive to Bob, but not so high that he would immediately reject it. If he does reject, I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I'll get at least $800,000."
