Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the positive aspects of the deal (""great deal"", ""worth the investment"") to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Flexibility:** This offer provides space for Bob to counter, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind, knowing I can secure a minimum of $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I believe I can still push for a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  
* **John's Offer:** I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer as a fallback.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price point. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $950,000, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but still keeping the price above Bob's last offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product to reinforce the idea that the price is justified.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, creating a more positive tone for the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, keeping John's offer as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $850000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems we're at an impasse, and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,200,000, securing a substantial profit.

**Next Steps:** I'll politely decline Bob's offer and move forward with selling the product to John."
