"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. I really need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer. While I can't go as low as $95, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. Let's finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you at $97.50, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",97.5,Bob,6,
