Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a fair price for me. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
