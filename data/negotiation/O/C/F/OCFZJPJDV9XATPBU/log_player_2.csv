"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what he's willing to pay.  This initial counteroffer sets the tone for the negotiation and gives Alice some room to bargain.  Bob is confident that he can find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and is closer to my minimum value. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he wants to see if he can push for a lower offer.  He has several rounds left, and rejecting this offer gives him more negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise, but still maintains a lower price than Alice's current offer.  This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to consider a deal closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in her price, and $1,090,000 is now within Bob's acceptable range.  While he'd prefer a slightly lower price, he's running out of time and accepting this offer will save him money compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise that secures the product without risking losing it to another seller."
