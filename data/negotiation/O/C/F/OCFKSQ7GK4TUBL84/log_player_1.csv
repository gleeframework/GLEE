"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still can't go above $100. Is there any way we can meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, Bob seems stuck at $100. Accepting his offer gets me a decent profit above my minimum.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk him walking away and only getting $80 from John."
