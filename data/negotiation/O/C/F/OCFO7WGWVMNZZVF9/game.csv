"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $140. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $140 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $90. Would you be open to that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50? That's a fair compromise.",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $107.50. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer and meet you at $120. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",120.0,Alice,7,
