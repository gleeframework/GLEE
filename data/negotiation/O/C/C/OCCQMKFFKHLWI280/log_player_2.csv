"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so you have some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is a reasonable compromise between Alice's asking price of $95 and my maximum willingness to pay of $100. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save $5 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $92, which is only $2 more than my counteroffer.  It's still a better price than John's $100, and there's a good chance further negotiation will only lead to a few more dollars off.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
