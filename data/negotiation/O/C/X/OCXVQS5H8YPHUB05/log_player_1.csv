"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer or express interest. 

**Strategy:**

This is a starting point.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses. My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, but still maximizes my earnings. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer but still below my minimum:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a good backup:** I'm aware that selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I'll also emphasize the value of the product to try and sway him to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 isn't quite enough for me to part with this product. It's truly unique and offers significant value.  How about $13,500? This would be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.  This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique qualities and potential value to Bob to encourage him to pay a bit more.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and optimistic, hoping to build a positive relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. I'm pushing for a price that's closer to my minimum, but still within the realm of reason for Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to reconsider selling to John, but I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your explanation. I am still interested in purchasing the product. Would $13,200 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer $13,500, $13,200 is only $300 below my minimum.  Given that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, this might be the best I can get.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with the less favorable option of selling to John for $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time and having to settle for John's offer. 

**Strategy:**

It's a calculated risk. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I'll make a profit, even if it's not the ideal amount. It also avoids the potential for further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a stalled deal.  I'm willing to take this slightly lower price to secure the sale and avoid the uncertainty of more negotiation."
