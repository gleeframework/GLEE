"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? This is a fair compromise and still gives you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a little high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a good deal for both of us, and allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is a tough one!  I can see we're getting closer. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you, and I think we're very close.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,625. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",11625.0,Alice,7,
