"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $700,000 is still pushing it for my budget.  How about we settle at $600,000? I think that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for me financially.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering it to you for $650,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about $620,000? That's a substantial investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",620000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider another adjustment. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $620,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering it to you for $640,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",640000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $630,000, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say?",630000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $630,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering it to you for $655,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",655000.0,Alice,9,
