Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000, knowing that it's likely Bob won't accept it immediately. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** My message highlights the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By saying ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to make a counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.

This approach balances the need to earn as much money as possible with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.  I'll also consider the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob becomes too lengthy or frustrating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell at that price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a higher amount.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiating:** I can try to secure a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  His counteroffer suggests he might be willing to go higher, but I need to see how far he's willing to budge.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping my options open and potentially setting myself up for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, showing respect and keeping the negotiation amicable.
* **Emphasize value:**  I reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob that my initial price was not arbitrary.
* **Compromise:**  While I'm not willing to go down to Bob's original price, I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price to $1,750,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Clear call to action:**  I end with a clear call to action, asking Bob to confirm if he's interested in moving forward at the new price. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my minimum desired price and Bob's initial offer.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving Bob a chance to consider my revised proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go as high as $1750000. How about $1600000? That's my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  While I'm not completely opposed to negotiating further, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is getting drawn out and potentially frustrating.

Considering the following factors:

* **My minimum price:** I'm determined to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Bob's ""best and final"" offer:** Bob's statement implies he's unlikely to go higher.

I've decided to take the sure thing and sell the product to John. It ensures I meet my minimum price without risking further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process."
