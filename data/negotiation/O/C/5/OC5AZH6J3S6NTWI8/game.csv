"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for both of us to get a fair deal. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be a fair deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still offers a substantial value to you. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  How about $950,000?  This reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
