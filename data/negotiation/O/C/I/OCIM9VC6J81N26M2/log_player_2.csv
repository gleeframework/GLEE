# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than what you'd pay John ($12,000).  While you'd prefer to pay even less, this offer still saves you $500 and meets your goal of buying the product within your budget."
