"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $15000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $17500. How about we split the difference and settle on $16250? It's a fair price that respects both our positions.",16250.0,Bob,4,
