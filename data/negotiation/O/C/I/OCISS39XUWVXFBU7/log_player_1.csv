Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 allows for negotiation room while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uses a friendly tone to encourage a positive response.
* **Option to walk away:**  Remembering that John offers $12,000 provides a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate.  John is a reliable buyer and offers a significantly better price, making it a better option than accepting Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:**  I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000, but I'm willing to meet halfway to encourage Bob to continue negotiations.
* **Staying firm on value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the $8,000 price. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Even though I'm rejecting his offer, I'm keeping the message friendly and open to continued negotiation."
