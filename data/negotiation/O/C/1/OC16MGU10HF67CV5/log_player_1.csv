Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm aiming higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $1,500,000 price provides a cushion for potential negotiation while still remaining significantly above my minimum.
* **Confident and positive tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and expresses optimism about reaching a mutually beneficial deal. 
 
This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit than my guaranteed sale to John."
