# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for a much higher price. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer.
