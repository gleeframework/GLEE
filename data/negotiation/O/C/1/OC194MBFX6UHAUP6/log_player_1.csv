{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a significant profit.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This ensures you won't be losing money if he accepts right away.
* **It leaves room for counter-offers:** This allows for a dynamic negotiation process.

By offering this price, you're starting the negotiation strong, while also keeping the option to sell to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like. You have more leverage, as you can sell to John for a much higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and see if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a great deal. I'm confident this price will work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It shows Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Maintains profitability:** It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Positions you for a potential deal:** It leaves room for Bob to counter again, while also setting a strong price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John, making it risky to accept this offer. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially push for a higher price, or to safely sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for a much higher price. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Sets a firm price:**  It clearly communicates that $1,000,000 is your bottom line.
* **Highlights your alternative:**  Reminding Bob of your other buyer strengthens your position.
* **Leaves the decision to Bob:**  It puts the pressure on him to decide if he wants to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant difference, and the risk of further negotiation is too high. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price,  so selling to John is the most logical decision. It ensures you achieve your financial goal and minimizes the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
