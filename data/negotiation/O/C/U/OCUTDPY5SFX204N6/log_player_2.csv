Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $140, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $140, so I'm willing to do $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to push Alice further, getting the price down to $130 is a pretty good deal and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and ensures I get the product."
