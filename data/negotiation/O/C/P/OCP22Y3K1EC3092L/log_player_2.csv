"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $10,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you initiate the negotiation and can explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  The offer is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about buying but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains polite and emphasizes your interest in the product.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to start the negotiation effectively and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **You have room to negotiate further:**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is now at $9,500. There's still space to find a price that benefits both parties. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you maintain your negotiation leverage and aim to reach a price closer to your target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,250.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to come to a fair agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small adjustment:** The counteroffer is only $250 lower than Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message highlights that the proposed price is fair for both parties, helping to maintain a positive tone in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your desired price and Alice's current offer, making it more likely for her to accept."
