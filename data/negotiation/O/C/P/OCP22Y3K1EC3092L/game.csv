"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9250.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to come to a fair agreement.  What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
