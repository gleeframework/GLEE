"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject the offer because you're looking to save as much money as possible. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you see its value, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, you can still likely get a better price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $115 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $110. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
