"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm looking for a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $20,000 is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite far from what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $18,000 would be more reflective of that.  What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, thanks for your honesty.  I understand you've found another option, but I truly believe my product is superior, and I'm willing to make one final offer to prove it. I can't go below $14,500.  It's a great price for the value you're getting, and I'm confident you won't regret it. ",14500.0,Alice,7,
