"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair return.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $7,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
