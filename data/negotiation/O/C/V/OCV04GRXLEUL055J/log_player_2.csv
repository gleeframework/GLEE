{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate further and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $11,000, but it's still within a range where Alice might consider it. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my ideal price, I am still willing to negotiate further.  There's a good chance I can get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $9000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,000.  It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my maximum budget."
