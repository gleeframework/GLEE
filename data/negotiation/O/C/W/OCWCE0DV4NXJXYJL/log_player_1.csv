This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that amount just yet. I believe there's potential to get a higher price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to my desired price than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It is also closer to my last offer of $12,500. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
