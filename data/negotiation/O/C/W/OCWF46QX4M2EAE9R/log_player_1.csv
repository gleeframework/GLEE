Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is good, I still have room to negotiate.  I started high, knowing he'd likely counter. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not all the way to his offer yet. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is my safety net, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Splitting the difference between his counteroffer and my previous offer seems like a fair and reasonable approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,360,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but he's also holding firm in the $1.3 million range. Accepting his offer of $1,360,000 is a good dealâ€”it's significantly more than my fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000. There's a risk Bob might not go much higher, and I don't want to push him away or run out of negotiation rounds."
