"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $100 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $115.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $110? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,4,
