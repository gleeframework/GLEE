# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering $95, which is a good start, but you can likely get it for less. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $95 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$90 is still a bit more than you'd like to pay, and you have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close! I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $89, which is within your budget and a decent deal. It's getting close to your preferred price point, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal. It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
