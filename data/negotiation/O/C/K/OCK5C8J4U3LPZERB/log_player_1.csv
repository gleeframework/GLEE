"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,500,000.  It's a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value of the product might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving room for more potential profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer, and we can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm concerned about the time running out, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum, but a lower price than my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates a genuine desire to reach an agreement while also ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering significantly lower prices. Time is running out and I'm not confident I can get him to my minimum price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, which is more important than trying to squeeze out an extra profit."
