Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $12,000. I'm guaranteed to get this from John if Bob rejects.
* **Potential upside:**  I'm hoping Bob values the product higher than $12,000. Offering $15,000 gives him a good deal while still leaving me a decent profit.
* **Risk:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk in hopes of getting a higher price.

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
