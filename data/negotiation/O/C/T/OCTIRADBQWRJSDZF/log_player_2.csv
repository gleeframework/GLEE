"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value ($80) to see if she's willing to accept a smaller profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. I can gradually increase my offer if needed.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite and expresses my interest while clearly stating my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $92 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice lowered her price, $92 is still above her own valuation of the product. This suggests there might be some wiggle room to negotiate further.
* **Closer to My Limit:** I'm getting closer to my maximum price, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down a bit more before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $88? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between my last offer ($85) and Alice's current offer ($92). This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Maintaining Politeness and Seeking Agreement:** The message keeps a friendly and collaborative tone, aiming to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Getting Closer to a Decision:** I'm getting closer to my upper limit, so I need to decide if $88 is my final offer before considering John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $90, but I need to make a profit, so that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has signaled that $90 is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Significant Savings:**  $90 is still a significant saving compared to John's price of $120.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result and could take more time and effort. It's usually best to accept a reasonable offer when you're satisfied with the savings."
