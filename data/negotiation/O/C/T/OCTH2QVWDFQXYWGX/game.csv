"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a significant discount from my original price. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
