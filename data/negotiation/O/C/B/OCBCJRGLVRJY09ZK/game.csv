"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $8,500 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
