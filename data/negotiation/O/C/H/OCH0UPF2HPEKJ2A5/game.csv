"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's as high as I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business,  $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,300,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,250,000 is the maximum I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
