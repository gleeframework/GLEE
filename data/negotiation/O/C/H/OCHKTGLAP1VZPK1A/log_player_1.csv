"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we'll start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can get more. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  This price is still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. I've already had 3 rounds of negotiation and he's come up from his initial offer.  It's getting close to my desired price and accepting now will secure a good deal. There's always a risk he might reject my next counteroffer and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John."
