"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. The product is worth a lot to me, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good price for him, and it's still a profit for Alice.  If he rejects and counteroffers, he risks Alice walking away, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
