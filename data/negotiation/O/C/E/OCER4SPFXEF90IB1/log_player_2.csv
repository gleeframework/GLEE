"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* The product is worth $8,000 to Alice. 
* You are willing to pay up to $10,000.
* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is still a decent deal for you, but you can likely get it for less.
* By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a little less.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
