Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I want to get as close to that as possible.
* **My value:** My minimum is $1,000,000, so I don't want to go below that.
* **John's value:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net, meaning I don't have to accept a price lower than that.

By offering $1,150,000, I'm maximizing my potential profit while still being within a range that Bob might find acceptable."
