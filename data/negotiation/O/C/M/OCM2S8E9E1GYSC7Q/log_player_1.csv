{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using an open-ended message to encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's not happy with my initial price. 

**Why not go higher?** 

While I could try for $13,000 or even $14,000, the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer is higher. I want to keep the negotiation flowing and give Bob some incentive to work with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it's a sign that he's interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a great price for you, and I could make it work on my end.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation for both of us.  
* **Open-ended message:** I'm keeping the conversation open and inviting Bob to respond.

**Why not go higher?**

While I could ask for more, I want to keep the negotiation moving forward. By offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, I increase the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a large loss.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  While I'm getting closer to Bob's price, I still have some leverage. Bob has indicated that he's willing to negotiate and that he values the product.
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise, but I will not budge significantly on my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm offering a smaller compromise this time, reducing my price by $500 instead of the $1,000 reduction in the previous round. This shows that I'm taking Bob's position seriously but am still holding firm on my minimum price.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, hoping to nudge him towards accepting my offer.
* **Fairness appeal:** I'm framing my offer as fair to both parties, aiming to create a sense of compromise and mutual benefit. 

**Why not go lower?**

While I could offer $9,750 or something closer to Bob's offer, I believe $10,000 is a fair compromise. Any lower, and I risk accepting a price that's too low for my minimum profit margin."
