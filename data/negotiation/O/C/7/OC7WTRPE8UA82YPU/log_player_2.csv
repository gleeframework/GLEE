"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $100 by many customers due to its unique features and high quality. Would you like to purchase it at our special introductory price of $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $95, which is still higher than Bob's maximum value. 
* **Strategic advantage:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating and potentially get a better price.

**Next steps:** Bob will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $85.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still making a deal.
* **Initial offer:** Alice's offer of $95 is still too high. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Starting with a counteroffer close to Alice's perceived value ($80) gives Bob room to negotiate while still showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we agree on a price of $90 for the product? I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $87? "", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $90 is still higher than Bob's target.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Bob is increasing his offer by a smaller amount this time, showing his willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Timing:**  Since this is round 4, Bob needs to be mindful of the limited rounds remaining and the potential of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise. How does a price of $89 sound for the product? I believe this offers a fair value for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still buy the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $89, which is only slightly higher than Bob's target price of $85.
* **Strategic consideration:** With limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer minimizes risk. If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, Alice might reject it, forcing Bob to either buy from John or lose out entirely. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting this offer secures a good deal for Bob, even if it's not his ideal price. It's a calculated risk to minimize the chance of losing the product altogether."
