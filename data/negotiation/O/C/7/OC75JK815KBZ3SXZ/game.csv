"Thank you for the offer, but $18000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can offer you a compromise at $12000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway to make a deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which would allow me to make this purchase and still stay within my budget.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows me to make a decent profit.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $10000. I can offer you a slight concession at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",10500.0,Alice,7,
