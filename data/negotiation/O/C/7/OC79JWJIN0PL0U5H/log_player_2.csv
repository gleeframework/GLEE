Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential worth to your business.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the budget. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant. Let's meet halfway - I can do $1,075,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $1,075,000 is less than your maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer.**  Further negotiation might not yield a lower price, and you risk losing the deal. 
* **The price is reasonable.** You're getting the product for a price closer to your ideal target of $1,000,000.  

It's always a good idea to consider the potential for a better deal, but in this case, accepting Alice's offer is a good move to secure the product within your budget."
