"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product and its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that there's room for a counteroffer that will still be better than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's still a good deal for both of us, and allows me to keep some of the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget though. How about $13000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than John's offer of $12,000 and is close to my counteroffer of $13,500.  I'm going to accept this offer to secure the deal."
