Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,999,999. Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value but avoids being overly specific.  The high price is presented confidently, aiming to make Bob perceive it as justified.
* **Negotiation Room:** The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters with a lower offer, you're still likely to end up with a price significantly higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Psychological Impact:** A high initial offer can anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a still-high but slightly lower counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knows your bottom line, this approach might be less effective."
