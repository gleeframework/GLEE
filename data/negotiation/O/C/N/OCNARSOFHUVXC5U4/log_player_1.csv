{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $100, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $150. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115? That would be fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about $115, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum,  $90 is still below what I consider acceptable.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially with John willing to pay my minimum price. I'm going to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
