"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to me is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know if this revised price aligns with your budget.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
