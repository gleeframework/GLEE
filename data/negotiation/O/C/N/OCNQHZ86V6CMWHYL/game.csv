"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable for my business, $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $700,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000.
