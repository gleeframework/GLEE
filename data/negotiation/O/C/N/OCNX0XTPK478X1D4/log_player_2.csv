"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $150 by you, which aligns perfectly with its worth. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a fair deal. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $120? This price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice is being a bit cheeky inflating the perceived value, $120 is a decent price and significantly lower than your alternative option of buying from John for $150."
