"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay that much for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $98 is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,6,
