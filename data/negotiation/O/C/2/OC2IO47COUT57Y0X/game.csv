"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. I'm asking for $2000000, a price that reflects its worth.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is my maximum for this kind of investment.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  While $1250000 is closer, it's still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1500000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1350000, a final price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
