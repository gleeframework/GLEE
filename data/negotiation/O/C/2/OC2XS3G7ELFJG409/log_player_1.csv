Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. Hopefully this will encourage him to accept, as it's a good deal for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,500.  It's a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but still a good deal for him, and it gets me closer to my desired profit. I only have a few rounds left, so I'm trying to find a price that will work for both of us."

Bob's offer is now the same as John's offer.  Since I only have two rounds left, I don't have time to try to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll take John's offer and sell him the product for $10,000."
