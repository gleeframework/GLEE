Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

While I could push for a higher price, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks losing him as a buyer altogether. It's time to close the deal."
