# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get an even lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I can offer it to you for $850,000. What do you think?

$850,000 is a great price, and it's getting closer to my target.  It's a better deal than buying from John, and it's a good compromise with Alice.  I'll accept."
