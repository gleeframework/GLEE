Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you want to start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet you closer to his perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's high value without explicitly revealing your minimum price. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer or negotiates down slightly, you earn more than selling to John.
2. **Secure a deal quickly:** By offering a price closer to your desired outcome, you might persuade Bob to agree without protracted negotiations. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
