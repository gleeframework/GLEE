"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8700?",8700.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8700 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9200 to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident the product will be worth the investment for you.  Would you be willing to reconsider?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9200 and $8000, which would be $8600. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8600.0,Bob,4,
