Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  $9,500 is a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at ($8,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). 
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob and framing the offer as a good deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Start negotiations:**  A reasonable offer that leaves room for negotiation.
* **Maximize profit:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum than Bob's maximum.
* **Maintain leverage:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the ability to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $9500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,700 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more favorable price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,700 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,200 to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident the product will be worth the investment for you.  Would you be willing to reconsider?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's still below my minimum ($10,000), but higher than Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a target price closer to my value.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the value of the product to him, hoping to encourage a compromise. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm still not at my minimum value, and I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price point. The negotiation process is a give-and-take, and this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9200 and $8000, which would be $8600. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,600 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, it seems like Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my price range. Rather than continue a potentially lengthy and unproductive negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  This ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids further risk of a lower sale price."
