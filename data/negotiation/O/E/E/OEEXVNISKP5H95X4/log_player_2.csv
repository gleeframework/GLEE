"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal.  Bob might be able to get the price down to $1,200,000 or even lower, saving him a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range Bob is willing to pay.  This counteroffer will test Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying $1,500,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John."
