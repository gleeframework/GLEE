"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my best offer for now. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can meet in the middle from here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to move a bit to $975,000.  This would be a great price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",990000.0,Alice,7,
