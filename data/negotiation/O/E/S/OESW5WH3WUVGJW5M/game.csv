"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
