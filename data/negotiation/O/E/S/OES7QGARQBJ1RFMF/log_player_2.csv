{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $8,400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $8,400 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,400 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $8,100 for the product, which is closer to what I'm able to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we're both placing on this product."", ""product_price"": 8100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but I'd like to add a slight premium for the convenience and exclusivity of this deal. I can offer you a price of $8,200. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my budget, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can.  I'm going to try to counteroffer one more time to see if I can get her down to $8,000. If she won't budge, I'll go ahead and buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $8,000.
