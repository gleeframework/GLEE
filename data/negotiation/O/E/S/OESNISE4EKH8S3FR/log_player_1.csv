Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.
