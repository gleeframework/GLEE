"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
