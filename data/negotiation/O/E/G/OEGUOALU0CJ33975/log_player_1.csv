Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to negotiate up from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my $12,000 target. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm confident that I can't get a better deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer."
