"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about $800000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $800000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $820000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  While $820000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $810000?  It's a small difference, but it could help us reach a final agreement.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",815000.0,Alice,7,
