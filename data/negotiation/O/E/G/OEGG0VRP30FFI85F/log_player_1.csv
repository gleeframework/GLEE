Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still substantially lower than John's guaranteed price. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm going to make one final offer: $1,250,000.  If you accept, we have a deal.  If not, I'll be forced to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

}

While we could push Bob a bit further, accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at $1,250,000, we're well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, securing a substantial profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Bob is clearly signaling this is his final offer.  Pushing further risks losing him entirely, forcing us to settle for John's $1,500,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the capital sooner, potentially generating further returns."
