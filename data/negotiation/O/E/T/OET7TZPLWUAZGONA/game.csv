"I'm not sure $12,500 is a good compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we settle on $12,250? ",12250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $12,750 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to go up to $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",12500.0,Bob,6,
