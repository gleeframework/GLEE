"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a fair price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. Accepting his offer ensures a profit and avoids further negotiation rounds."
