"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good profit for me considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $14,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work, I can offer you $12,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum profit margin. I can meet you at $13,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're working with a profit margin, but I'm sticking to my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum profit margin. I can meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,9,
