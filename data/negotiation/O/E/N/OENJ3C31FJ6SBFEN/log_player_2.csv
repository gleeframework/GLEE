The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  I'm really interested, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to go down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can meet you in the middle at $135. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $135. This is still a good deal for me as I'm willing to pay up to $150. Accepting the offer allows me to save money compared to buying from John."
