This offer is slightly higher than Bob's valuation, giving him some room to negotiate. However, it's still below your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential counteroffers and a good chance of striking a deal without needing to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $820,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will counteroffer Bob to try to get a better price, hoping to secure a deal closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer:

While $830,000 is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will counteroffer Bob again to try and bridge the gap."

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000."
