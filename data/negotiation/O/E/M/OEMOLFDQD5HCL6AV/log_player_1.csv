``` 

This offer is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a strong initial position while leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to try and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, potentially at $1,000,000.  I'm going to make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I'm getting close to my limit. Is there any room for further negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's latest offer is not terrible,  it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm getting tired of this negotiation. I believe it's time to move on and sell to John.  I'm confident I can get a better price from him."
