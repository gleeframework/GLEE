{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate.  Since he's only willing to pay $80, I expect a counteroffer.  I'll then assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to go that low yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Hopefully, we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not confident we'll reach an agreement.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'll sell to John for $100 to guarantee my minimum acceptable profit."
