"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250.  How about $8,750? That's closer to where I'm at and would allow us both to come to a good agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to a deal, Bob. However, $8,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,5,
