"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering the product for $9,000. While this is a good deal, it's still possible to get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is closer to your desired price but still higher than your ideal. It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially offering a price closer to $8,750 to meet halfway again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250.  How about $8,750? That's closer to where I'm at and would allow us both to come to a good agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to a deal, Bob. However, $8,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,100 is a good deal. While it's slightly higher than your initial counteroffer of $8,750, it's still within your budget and significantly lower than the $10,000 you'd pay John.  It's unlikely you'll get a lower price from Alice, so it's best to accept the offer and secure the product."
