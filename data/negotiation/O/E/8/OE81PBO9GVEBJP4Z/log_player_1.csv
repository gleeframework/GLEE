{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the middle ground ($120) between my minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer provides room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. It also gives me a chance to assess his interest and potentially adjust my price.
* **Friendly Approach:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80), it's still significantly lower than my initial offer ($120) and my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting his offer gives me more information about Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to the middle ground between his offer and my desired price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This creates a sense of fairness and a middle ground for both parties.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** Using a positive tone and highlighting the product's value reinforces the idea that the price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $97.50 is very close to my desired price point and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might become less interested or that I might end up with a lower price.
* **Time Consideration:**  Accepting the offer now allows me to finalize the sale and avoid further negotiation rounds."
