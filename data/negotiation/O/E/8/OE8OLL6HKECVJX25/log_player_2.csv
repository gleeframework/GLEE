"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice.  It's worth $8,000 to her, so you can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving you a good deal.  It's also a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for you, as it's within your budget of $15,000 and lower than your initial counteroffer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially losing the deal altogether. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without taking unnecessary risks."
