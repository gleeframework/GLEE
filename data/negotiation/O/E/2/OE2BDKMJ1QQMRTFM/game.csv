"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I can comfortably spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is closer to where I'm at, but I'm still a little tight on my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
