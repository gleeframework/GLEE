Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I am aware that I can sell the product to John for $100, which acts as my safety net.  I won't accept any offer below this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to push for a better deal. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $110. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price above the midpoint between my initial price ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). 
* **Maintaining Value:** By not dropping too low, I am reinforcing the perceived value of the product.  
* **Preserving Profit:** This counteroffer still leaves me with a profit margin that is acceptable given John's standing offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $107.50 is a reasonable compromise.  

* **Above Minimum:** It is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($100) and my alternative offer from John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether, and the potential gain from further negotiation is relatively small at this point.
* **Fair Deal:**  Meeting in the middle suggests a fair deal has been reached."
