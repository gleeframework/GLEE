Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer $1250000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
