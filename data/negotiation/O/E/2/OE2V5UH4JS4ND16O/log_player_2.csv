"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1000000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,500,000) and leaves considerable room for negotiation.  While buying from John would be a safe option, I can potentially get a better deal by engaging in further negotiation with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the product's value to you and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal for me. It's below my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and is only slightly more than what the product is worth to Alice.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and I could end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
