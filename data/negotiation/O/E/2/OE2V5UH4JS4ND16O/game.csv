"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1000000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1000000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer $1250000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the product's value to you and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1200000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
