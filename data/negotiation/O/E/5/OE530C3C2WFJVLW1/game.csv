"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget of around $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've driven a hard bargain, and I respect that.  $85 is close, but I have to be honest, I can get a very similar product for $80 elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50.  That's my final offer, and I think it's more than fair.",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $87.50. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",87.5,Alice,7,
