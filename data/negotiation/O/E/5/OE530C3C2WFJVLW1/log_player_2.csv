"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget of around $60. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying under my $80 maximum.
* **Expressing Interest:**  I want Alice to know I'm serious about buying but need a more reasonable price. 
* **Setting a Target:** My ideal price range is probably around $70-75. By starting low, I'm hoping to meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice meeting me ""halfway"" suggests there's flexibility in the price. I'll continue negotiating. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'll keep John's $80 offer in mind as a fallback if the negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I've increased my offer to $75, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This offer is slightly above the midpoint between our previous offers ($60 and $90), aiming for a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Clear and Direct:**  I'm stating my offer clearly and confidently, hoping Alice will see it as a reasonable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** Alice is getting very close to my maximum budget, but I think I can still negotiate a slightly better price.
* **Leverage:** Alice has stated this is her ""lowest offer,"" but I still have the option of buying from John for $80.  This gives me some leverage. 
* **One More Try:**  I'll make one more counter-offer, aiming to split the difference between her last offer and John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've driven a hard bargain, and I respect that.  $85 is close, but I have to be honest, I can get a very similar product for $80 elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $82.50.  That's my final offer, and I think it's more than fair."",
""product_price"": 82.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and unlikely to move further.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning the $80 alternative (without explicitly saying it's John) adds a sense of urgency and reason for Alice to accept my offer.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Proposing $82.50 represents a compromise and a clean resolution, which is often appealing in negotiations. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and I need to leave Alice enough time to consider this final offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $87.50. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice is unlikely to budge below $87.50, and I've been clear about my $82.50 limit.  Further negotiation seems pointless. 
* **Not Worth the Difference:**  The difference between her final offer and John's price is now only $7.50. It's not worth the additional time and effort to haggle further. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing the negotiation means potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with nothing if the negotiation drags on."
