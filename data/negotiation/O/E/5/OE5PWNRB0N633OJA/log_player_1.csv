I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product. I want to leave some room for negotiation, but also make it clear that I value this product highly."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

I'm going to counteroffer at $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $16,000 is a good price and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer."
