"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer is a good strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to your limit.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is now offering $95.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.**  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has moved closer to your offer.  There's a good chance more rounds will just lead to further concessions, which may not be worth the time.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  While you have the option to buy from John for $120, Alice's offer is a much better deal."
