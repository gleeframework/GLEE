"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by being friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also reiterating my willingness to compromise."
