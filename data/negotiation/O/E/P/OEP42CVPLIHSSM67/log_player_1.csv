Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value while presenting a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good starting price:** $12,000 is a significant profit for you.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob might counteroffer, giving you the chance to adjust the price.
* **Show confidence:** By offering a higher price, you convey that you believe in the product's value.
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, you can always sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $15,000. Selling to John guarantees you the highest possible profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price or, if negotiations fail, move on to the guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  This is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to have this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns while reiterating the product's value and the attractiveness of the price. 
* **Strategy:**  By offering a slightly lower price, you show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This keeps the door open for a deal while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still not enough to warrant accepting the offer.  At this point, you have two choices:

* **Reject and Counteroffer:** You can try to push for a slightly higher price, hoping Bob will budge.
* **Sell to John:**  Selling to John guarantees you the highest possible profit and avoids further negotiations.

Since the difference between your current offer and John's offer is significant, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob.  However, if the next counteroffer isn't closer to your ideal price, you should move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $10,250?  This is a very fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy.  It's also a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $10,250 is a small compromise, just a quarter of the way between your last offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility without significantly reducing your profits.
* **Message:** The message continues to emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of the price. It also subtly reminds Bob that you have other options, encouraging him to accept your offer.
* **Strategy:**  This strategy is a calculated risk. It's possible Bob will reject this counteroffer, but it's also possible that he'll see it as a fair compromise and accept.  If he rejects it, you'll need to decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm really not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but no higher. It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has firmly stuck to his $10,000 offer, and further negotiations are unlikely to lead to a higher price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing a much larger profit.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that you could lose both Bob and John, resulting in no sale at all. Selling to John guarantees a sale at a price that meets your minimum requirements."
