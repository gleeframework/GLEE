"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value! What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  This is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to have this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $10,250?  This is a very fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy.  It's also a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm really not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but no higher. It's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
