"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about $14,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're serious about this product. $13,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $13,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, as I mentioned before, or I can consider other options. How about we meet at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my minimum to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity to own this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,400, so how about $13,200?",13200.0,Bob,8,
