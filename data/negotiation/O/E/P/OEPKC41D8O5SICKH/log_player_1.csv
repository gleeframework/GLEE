Round 6

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,400, so how about $13,200?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm concerned I won't be able to get a higher price with the limited time remaining. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
