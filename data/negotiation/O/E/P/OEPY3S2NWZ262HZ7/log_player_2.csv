# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay for the product from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the current offer is already beneficial to you and saves you $100,000."
