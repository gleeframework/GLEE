{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product holds a value of $1,000,000 for Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By phrasing the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive, you add a subtle psychological nudge for Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob with a price that benefits him while still securing a substantial profit for yourself."
