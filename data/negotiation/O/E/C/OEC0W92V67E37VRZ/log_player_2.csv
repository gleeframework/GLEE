"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying but is also willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, emphasizing the value to him and Alice's original asking price. This makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, leaving room for Alice to counter and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $9,500, it's still more than what Bob ideally wants to pay.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price. He has several rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize the deal. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:** Bob is proposing a smaller price drop than before, showing he's serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Fair Compromise:**  The message frames the offer as a ""compromise,"" suggesting a willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Positive Tone:** The message uses positive language like ""hopefully"" and ""finalize,"" keeping the negotiation amicable."
