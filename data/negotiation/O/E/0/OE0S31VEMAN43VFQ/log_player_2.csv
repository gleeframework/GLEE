Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it's not worth risking a higher price when John offers a guaranteed $10,000."
