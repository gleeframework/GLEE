Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clear that this is a starting point and I'm open to discussing the price further. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I aim to get a price closer to my minimum. 
* I can then adjust my offer based on Bob's counteroffers or move on to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial assessment, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a higher price, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.
* **Continue Negotiation:** I'm committed to seeing how far I can push the negotiation with Bob before potentially accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still above my minimum price, but I'm demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the benefit for both of us, making the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* **Step-by-Step Negotiation:**  I'm taking a gradual approach, slowly narrowing the gap between our desired prices. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not rushing into a deal, but I'm also not letting the negotiation drag on too long. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my options, potentially moving towards John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet at $1,075,000. I propose we set the product price at $1,060,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is only $40,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,100,000. 
* **Further Negotiation Uncertain:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will budge. Continuing could risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a significantly higher price, I need to weigh the potential for a longer negotiation with Bob against the certainty of a lower price with John.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gains from further negotiation are small compared to the risk of losing the deal. 
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the uncertainty of continuing negotiations.

**Conclusion:**  Given the close proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum, I'm choosing to accept his offer and secure a sale."
