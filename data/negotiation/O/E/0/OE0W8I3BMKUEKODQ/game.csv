"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the transaction. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet at $1,075,000. I propose we set the product price at $1,060,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
