"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
