"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little higher than where I'd like to be. How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I was thinking maybe we could meet at $108? I'm trying to make a profit on this sale, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",108.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer! I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $103? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",103.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your determination, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $103. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think I can do $106. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",106.0,Alice,7,
