Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $975,000 - $50,000 = $925,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his offer of $925,000.  He's set a clear ceiling and is negotiating in small increments. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob has diminishing returns and a high risk of ending up with a worse deal."
