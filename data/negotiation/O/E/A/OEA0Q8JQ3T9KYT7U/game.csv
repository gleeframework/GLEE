"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've both assessed, I'd like to offer $850,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profitable deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This offer reflects the product's value while still allowing you a significant return on your investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This offer is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while allowing us to close this deal quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
