**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and shows you value the product. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and his willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price."
