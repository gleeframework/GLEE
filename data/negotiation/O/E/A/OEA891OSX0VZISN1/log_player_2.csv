"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, you have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate with Alice, and there's a chance you can get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000 to find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above my target.  I have more rounds to negotiate and can try to get a lower price.  It's not worth the risk of accepting this offer and potentially missing out on an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering both our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to $7500.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my target, I still have more rounds left and believe I can get a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if I can push for a lower price."
