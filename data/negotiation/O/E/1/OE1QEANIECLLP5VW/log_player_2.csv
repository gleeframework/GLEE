While getting the price lower is ideal, Alice has consistently met in the middle during the negotiation.  At this point, the potential savings of a few thousand dollars aren't worth the risk of her increasing her price or the deal falling through entirely.  Accepting the $785,000 secures a significant discount from her initial offer and from John's price."
