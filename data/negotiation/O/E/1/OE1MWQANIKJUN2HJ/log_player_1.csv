"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll see if Bob's interested in paying a premium. If not, I can adjust my price downwards in later rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is still a good price, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still hoping for a good profit but also want to close the deal before I lose too much time."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good profit by continuing to haggle.  $920,000 is a fair price and I'm happy with it."
