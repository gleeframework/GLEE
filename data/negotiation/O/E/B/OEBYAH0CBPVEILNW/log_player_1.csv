"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough that I'm still making a significant profit, but low enough that Bob might be willing to accept it since it's still below his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see where the negotiation goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. This counteroffer still gives me a decent profit while being closer to Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire to get a price closer to my desired $900,000. It's a compromise that might be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
