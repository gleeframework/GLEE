"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works. How about we settle on $10,250? That's just a small step up from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,
