{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's also less than my minimum selling price, giving me some wiggle room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum selling price. I'm willing to negotiate, but $100 is simply too low. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $125? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
