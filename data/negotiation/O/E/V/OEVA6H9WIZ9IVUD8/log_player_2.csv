"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $140 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant jump down, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $125? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, and $125 is close enough to my maximum budget. It's not worth risking going to John and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
