"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this work. This represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to go with another seller.",14000.0,Bob,4,
