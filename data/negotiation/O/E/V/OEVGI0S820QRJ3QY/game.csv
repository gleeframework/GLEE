,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
