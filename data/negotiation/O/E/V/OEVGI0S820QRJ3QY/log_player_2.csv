"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a significant gap between her offer and her bottom line.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer allows for potential savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than my ideal price of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, as Alice's offer is closer to my counteroffer than her initial offer.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows for further potential savings."
