# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value from it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $1,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While the product looks interesting, I'm unfortunately capped at $8,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I can see the value in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the quality and benefits you'll get from the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $8,500 is still above his maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further. There's a chance she might be willing to accept Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,500 is still a bit outside my budget. As I mentioned before, my absolute maximum is $8,000.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm ready to close at that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
