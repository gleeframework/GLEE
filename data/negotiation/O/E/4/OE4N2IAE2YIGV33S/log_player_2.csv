"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even less.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $50. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds, I'm willing to risk a rejection in the hopes of securing a better price.  Alice likely won't accept this offer immediately, but it will force her to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $75 offer to $65.  This is a good price point considering that you are aiming to get the product for under $100. Accepting this offer means saving $35 compared to buying from John, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed in the future."
