"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for it. Can you consider my offer?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $78 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
