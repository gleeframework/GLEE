Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net.  Any offer Bob accepts above $800,000 is a win for Alice. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price."
