Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if it's better to sell to John for the guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still less than the $10,000 I initially offered.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm countering with $9,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to be flexible but also that I value the product. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,600. While it's still slightly lower than my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a significant improvement over selling to John for $8,000. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate. It's time to finalize the deal."
