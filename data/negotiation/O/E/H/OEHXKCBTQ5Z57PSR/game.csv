"Alice, I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
