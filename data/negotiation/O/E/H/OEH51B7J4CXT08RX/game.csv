"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $115? It's still a fair price for you and within my budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $115 is a good price, but I'm still a little ways from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make this sale.",125.0,Alice,3,
