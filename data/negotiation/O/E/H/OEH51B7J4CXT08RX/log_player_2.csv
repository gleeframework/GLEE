"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more than that to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for even cheaper. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $115? It's still a fair price for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $115 is a good price, but I'm still a little ways from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $150 and closer to his ideal price than John's offer. Accepting at this point is the best strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price."
