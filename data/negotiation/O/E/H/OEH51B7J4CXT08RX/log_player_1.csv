{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more than that to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is higher than your minimum selling price of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $130 is less than the value Bob places on the product ($150). This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's still space to negotiate before either of you walk away. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $115? It's still a fair price for you and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'm confident that I can make a counteroffer that will still be attractive to Bob but bring me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $115 is a good price, but I'm still a little ways from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make this sale."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my goal:** $125 is closer to my desired price than $115.
* **Still attractive to Bob:** This is still below Bob's perceived value of $150, so it's likely to be appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, we still have some space to work with before either of us has to walk away."
