"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of it right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm confident it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1500000? This offer is exclusive to you, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John."
