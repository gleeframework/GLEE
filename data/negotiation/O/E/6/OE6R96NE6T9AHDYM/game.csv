"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
