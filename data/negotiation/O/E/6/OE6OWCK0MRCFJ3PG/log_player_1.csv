"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to get him to reveal some of his cards.  If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. I'll also be mindful of the time limit and the fallback option of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'd like to see if I can squeeze out a bit more by counter-offering. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $750,000, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer, which might make Bob more likely to agree.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John, so I'm not in a hurry to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure this deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.  I can always try to improve the price in future rounds if I have the opportunity."
