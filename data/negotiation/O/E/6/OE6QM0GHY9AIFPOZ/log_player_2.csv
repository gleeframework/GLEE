"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $110 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $95 is a fair price, I'm aiming for something a bit closer to $105.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $105 is a good deal for Bob. It's less than John's price of $120 and still within Bob's budget of $120. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
