"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $140 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  $125 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $132.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",132.5,Alice,5,
