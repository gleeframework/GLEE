Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  While $65 is below what I need to sell it for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it offers.

Round 5

Round 7

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $80, and you have a guaranteed option with John."
