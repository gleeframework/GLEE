# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1300000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $100,000 over your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is simply not acceptable. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1250000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still $50,000 above my budget.  I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  If I don't get a better offer from Alice, I'll likely buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price based on my valuation. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
