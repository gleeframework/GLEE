"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is simply not acceptable. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1250000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $1200000, which is a fair price based on my valuation. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
