Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the maximum potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worthwhile. 
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:** I'll either make a counteroffer closer to my initial price or decline and sell to John for $1,000,000. 
* **If Bob's counteroffer is close to my desired price:** I'll consider accepting, but I'll also be prepared to negotiate further. 

**Remember:** This is just the beginning. The key is to remain flexible and adapt to Bob's responses to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000.  I'll try to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me.
* **Strategic negotiation:** I'll be mindful of Bob's potential counteroffers and try to gauge his willingness to pay. 

**Remember:** The goal is to maximize my earnings. While $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm aiming for a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and leverage:** I'm offering $1,200,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Strategic middle ground:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway. It also provides a potential middle ground for further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he accepts, I get a good deal. If he rejects, I can assess whether to make further concessions or move on to John.

**Remember:**  I'm aiming for a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses and my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still too low:** $900,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** There's not much room for further negotiation. While I could counter with a slightly higher price, it's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

It's time to accept the guaranteed deal with John. While I might be able to get a slightly better price with Bob, the risk of further negotiation isn't worth it.  

**Remember:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and in this scenario, selling to John provides the best guarantee of a good outcome."
