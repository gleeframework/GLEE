"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Please let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
