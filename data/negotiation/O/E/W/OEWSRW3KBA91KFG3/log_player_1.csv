"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This is a high offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob. It demonstrates that I'm serious about selling but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still far below the product's value to Bob. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm still willing to negotiate but not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is close to John's offer, I believe I can still get more from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to close the deal closer to my initial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm coming down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, showing that I am willing to meet Bob halfway while still maintaining a comfortable profit. It also demonstrates a sense of urgency as we're nearing the middle of our rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer. While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
