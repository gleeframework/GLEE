"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $75?  I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $82.50 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $80.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision, and I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $81.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",81.5,Alice,5,
