"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000.  
* **John offers a better deal:** While John's price is higher than Alice's, it's still within your budget.

Since you can get the product from John for less than Alice's price, it's better to reject Alice's offer."
