# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation of the product ($1,500,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John at your maximum budget."
