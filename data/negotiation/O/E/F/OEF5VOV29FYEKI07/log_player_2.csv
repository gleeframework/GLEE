Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still a better deal than buying from John for $120.  It's also a fair compromise considering your counteroffer of $105.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
