Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000, so starting near that price is ideal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate. If Bob counters, Alice can still potentially secure a price significantly higher than $800,000.
* **Justifying the price:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing its true worth to Alice.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider if he sees enough value in the product."
