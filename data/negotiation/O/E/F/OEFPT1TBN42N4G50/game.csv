,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $90? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to find common ground. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? I'm really close to walking away, but I love this product and want to make it work.",82.5,Bob,6,
