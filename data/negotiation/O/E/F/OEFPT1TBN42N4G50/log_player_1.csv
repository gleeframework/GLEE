"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a fair price that is below your minimum but still allows room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone, making Bob feel like you are working together to find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $90? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I still have 6 rounds left to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to find common ground. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? I'm really close to walking away, but I love this product and want to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of rounds and Bob is not budging much.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120.  I'm not going to get much more from Bob and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
