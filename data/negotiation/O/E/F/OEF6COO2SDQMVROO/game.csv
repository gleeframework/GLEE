"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price, considering its value to me is significantly higher.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,500? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Is that something you'd consider?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $13,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about we split the difference at $13,250? It's a good compromise for both of us and will hopefully get us to a final agreement.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,800. That's as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12800.0,Bob,6,
