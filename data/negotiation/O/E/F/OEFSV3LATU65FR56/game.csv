"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's something that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects its exceptional value and the potential benefits it holds for your company. Let's discuss this further, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
