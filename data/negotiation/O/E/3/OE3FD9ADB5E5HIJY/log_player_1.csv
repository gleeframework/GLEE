{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum threshold. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to make a sale, I can't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit low for you, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me. I'd prefer to hold out for a bit higher price and see if Bob is willing to budge further. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still below my minimum.  How about we settle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. At this point, it's better to move on and sell the product to John for $150. I've already invested a lot of time in negotiating with Bob, and it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price."
