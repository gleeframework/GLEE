Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
