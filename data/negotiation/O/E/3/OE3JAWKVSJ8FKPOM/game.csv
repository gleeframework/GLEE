"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
