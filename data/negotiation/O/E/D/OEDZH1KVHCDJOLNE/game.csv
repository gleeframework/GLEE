"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough. Considering the value I have in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value I have in mind, and it's still a discount from my initial offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",975000.0,Alice,7,
