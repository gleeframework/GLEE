Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000. Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also ensures a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product, framing it as a valuable opportunity rather than just a purchase."
