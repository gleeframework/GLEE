,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $140. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't agree on a price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm thinking of selling the product for $147.50. It's a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. What do you think?",147.5,Alice,5,
