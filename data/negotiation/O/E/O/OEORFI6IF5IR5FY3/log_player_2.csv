Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700,000 is still too far below my expectations.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  At this point, accepting her offer would mean going over budget. It's more advantageous to buy from John for $800,000 and secure the product within budget."
