"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's also a good test to see if Bob is seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  This price should be attractive to Bob, but still leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
