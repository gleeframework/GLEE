"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point,  above my minimum value but leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $180 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. I believe this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $170 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. There are several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 185}
```

I'm going to counter with $185. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $165 is a decent price, I'm still not ready to settle.  I've already rejected offers closer to this price, and I believe with only a few rounds left, I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant concession, but I want to avoid the risk of Bob walking away completely. With fewer rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting the best possible price and ensuring a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $160 is not ideal, it's getting close to the risk of selling to John.  With only two rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer are slim. I'm choosing to secure the sale at a reasonable price."
