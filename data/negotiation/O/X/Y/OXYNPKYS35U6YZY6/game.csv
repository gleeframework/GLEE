"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still well below my maximum price and reflects the product's potential for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the price you're willing to pay.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This offer is more in line with the value you've indicated, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
