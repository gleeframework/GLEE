"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly below my maximum value.**  I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so $800,000 is a great starting point. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I have 10 rounds, so I can counteroffer and try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John, but I want to save money if possible."

```
