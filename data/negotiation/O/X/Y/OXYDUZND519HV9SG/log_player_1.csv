Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm offering it to you for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first implies a limited-time opportunity, which might encourage him to accept the offer quickly."
