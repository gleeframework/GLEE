"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering this product to me.  $10000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8500? This reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
