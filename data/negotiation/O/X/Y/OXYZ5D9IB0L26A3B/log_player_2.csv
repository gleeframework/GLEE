"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10000. I believe it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering this product to me.  $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is starting low with his counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially go up to $10,000 if necessary, but he wants to see if Alice will meet him halfway.
* **Reasoning:**  Bob gives a reason for his lower offer (budget) to make it seem more legitimate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8500? This reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is closer to his target price, there's still room for negotiation.  He can potentially get a lower price with more rounds of negotiation. He should continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is only offering $500 more than his previous offer, showing that he's getting closer to Alice's price.
* **Fair Price:**  Bob emphasizes the ""fair price"" aspect to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob mentions ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of urgency."
