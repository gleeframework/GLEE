"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while I still get a decent return on my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd prefer, but it's a good compromise.  The $1,350,000 price is still lower than her initial offer and closer to my goal.  I'll accept it."
