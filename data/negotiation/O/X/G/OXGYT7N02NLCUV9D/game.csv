"Thank you for your interest, Bob. We understand your perspective and would like to make a counterproposal. Given the mutual value we believe this product holds for both parties, we are willing to consider a price of $1,075,000. This amount reflects a compromise that acknowledges your valuation while maintaining a reasonable profit margin for us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for a price that's closer to the middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
