"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored to appreciate your interest and commitment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($1,000,000). You have room to negotiate and save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Starts strong:** It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Focuses on value:** It emphasizes the product's value to you, justifying your lower price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While lower than Alice's offer, it's still higher than her desired price, allowing for potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. We understand your perspective and would like to make a counterproposal. Given the mutual value we believe this product holds for both parties, we are willing to consider a price of $1,075,000. This amount reflects a compromise that acknowledges your valuation while maintaining a reasonable profit margin for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high. While she has moved closer to your price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely secure a better deal by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's aim for a price that's closer to the middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer  averages your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness emphasis:** The message reinforces the idea of a fair deal for both parties.
* **Finality:** By offering $1,000,000, you're essentially suggesting this is your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
