"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price that reflects its significant value. I'm starting at $1,750,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, considering your interest and the value this product holds. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is right in the middle of our current positions.  This way, we both get a good deal and can move forward with the transaction.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
