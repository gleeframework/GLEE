Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, considering your interest and the value this product holds. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further but not at $1,400,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is right in the middle of our current positions.  This way, we both get a good deal and can move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my minimum.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000, rather than risk going even lower with Bob."
