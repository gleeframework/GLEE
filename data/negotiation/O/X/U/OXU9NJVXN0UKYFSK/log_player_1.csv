"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than what you're willing to sell for. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value this product holds for me makes $1,200,000 difficult to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?
