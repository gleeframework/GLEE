"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, as it's still significantly higher than what you're willing to sell for. Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value this product holds for me makes $1,200,000 difficult to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This ensures we both benefit from the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
