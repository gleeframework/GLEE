"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your operations. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's significantly lower than that. Let's talk about a price of $1,200,000. This would give you a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
