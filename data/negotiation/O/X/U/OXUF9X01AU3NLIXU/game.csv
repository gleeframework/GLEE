"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should benefit both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price, considering your product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm happy to finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
