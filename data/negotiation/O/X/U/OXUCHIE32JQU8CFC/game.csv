"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for the product. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering its value. Let's make this happen.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $1,400,000 still falls short of what I need. To make this work, I need to get at least $1,600,000.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and this price reflects its true worth. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
