Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm framing the offer by referencing the value Bob places on the product, hoping to entice him.
* **Flexibility:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers and further negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have a backup option in John, which gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $90 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $120.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows me to maintain my negotiating position and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Preparation:**  By rejecting, I can now formulate a counteroffer that is more appealing to Bob than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $90 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $120 to $105, showing my willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to emphasize the value of the deal.
* **Keeping the Door Open:** The message uses open-ended phrasing to invite further discussion and a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $97.5 is very close to my ideal price of $105.
* **Minimizing Risk:** There is a risk that further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, pushing me to sell to John for $80.
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a significant profit of $17.50, which is a reasonable outcome considering the potential risks."
