"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work. ",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10,000 to you.",11500.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'll offer you the product for $12,000. This is a fair price that gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
