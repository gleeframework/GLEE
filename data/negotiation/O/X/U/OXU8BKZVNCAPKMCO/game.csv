"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to let you have this product for a one-time offer of $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to reach a deal. I can offer it to you for $15,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",15800.0,Alice,5,
