Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential return on investment makes the higher price more palatable. 

By offering the product at $925,000, you leave yourself room to negotiate down to a price that is still very profitable for you while being a good deal for Bob."
