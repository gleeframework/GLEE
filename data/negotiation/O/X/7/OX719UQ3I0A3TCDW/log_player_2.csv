"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $15,000 by you. I am offering it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to Alice's minimum value ($8,000) to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your valuation and preferences, I am willing to consider a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $12,000.  Bob can save $4,000 compared to buying from John, making it a good deal. While there's still room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
