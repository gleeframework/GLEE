"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong opening offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  I frame the price as reflecting the product's ""true worth,"" subtly anchoring the negotiation around a high value.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  While firm, I maintain an open and collaborative tone, encouraging dialogue and potential counteroffers. 
 
This strategy aims to:
  * **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, I secure a price significantly exceeding my minimum.
  * **Gather Information:**  His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we consider $1,875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,875,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation, demonstrating serious interest. However, it's still considerably below my target price. 

By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product holds more value. This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to:

* **Continue Pushing for a Higher Price:**  I have room to counter with a price closer to $2 million, potentially securing a better deal.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains an option if negotiations stall or Bob's offers are unreasonable.

**Overall Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a delicate balance between maximizing profit and avoiding a stalemate that might push me towards accepting John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings merits a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its potential."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise. This significant decrease aims to encourage Bob to make a more substantial offer in return. 
* **Holding Ground:**  My new offer is still well above Bob's, keeping pressure on him to move closer to my desired price range.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's unique value, justifying the higher price.

By finding a middle ground between aggressive negotiation and potential stalemate, I hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that secures a strong profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the product's potential and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm not ready to settle just yet. We're entering the middle phase of the negotiation, and I still have some leverage. 

* **Upward Trend:** Bob's offers have been consistently increasing, indicating he's eager to close the deal. This suggests there might be room for him to go even higher.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we progress through the rounds, the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000 becomes more appealing.  However, I believe I can still push Bob a bit further.

**Strategy:** My next counteroffer will be a smaller concession, signaling that I'm approaching my limit. This should encourage Bob to either meet me closer to my desired price or accept that we might not reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My message strikes a balance between firmness and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession of $50,000, indicating I'm reaching my lower limit.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I aim to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make his best move. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm pushing for a higher price, I'm mindful of the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  If Bob isn't willing to meet my price in the next round or two, I'll likely take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I've done some additional research and feel confident in offering $1,975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. While I'd ideally like a price closer to $2 million, Bob's offer of $1,975,000 is strong and a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price. 

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small increases, with the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now secures a substantial profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations that delay the sale. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's always a chance that Bob could back out or that unexpected circumstances could arise. Accepting his offer minimizes this risk.

While John's offer provides a safety net, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate with Bob is outweighed by the risks. Accepting Bob's offer secures a highly favorable outcome for me."
