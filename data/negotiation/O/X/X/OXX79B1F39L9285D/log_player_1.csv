Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($100) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $95 offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts immediately.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm aware I can sell the product to John for $80, which serves as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a price closer to $90 before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly above my minimum. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. If he rejects this, I might have to consider his $85 offer or John's $80 offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am still unable to go above $85 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stood firm at $85, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a reasonable profit ($5) over my alternative of selling to John for $80.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
