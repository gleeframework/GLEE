"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  We can always go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for her to counter if she's willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102?  That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at John's price. Let's see if we can get Alice a little closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 is a big jump. How about we meet in the middle at $96? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 96
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again to show willingness to negotiate while still trying to edge closer to our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $96 is still too far off. Let's try $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice has met our target price, which is the same as John's offer. There's no point in negotiating further or going to John, as we've achieved the best possible outcome."
