"Bob, I understand your offer is lower than my initial price, but $11,000 is simply too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to see if we can find a compromise.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $14,750.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $14,750 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
