"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $115. This is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $120 and Alice is asking for $115, a counteroffer of $110 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is only $2 more than your counteroffer.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $120 is not worth it. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $8 compared to John's price and secures the product."
