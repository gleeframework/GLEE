"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality and features."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $140 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll go above $140. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
