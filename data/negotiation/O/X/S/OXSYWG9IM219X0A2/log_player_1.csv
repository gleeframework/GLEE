"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $150 matches John's standing offer. Since my minimum acceptable price is $150, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob.  I'll take the guaranteed sale with John."
