"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet halfway.  I'm prepared to reduce my price to $14000. This allows for some negotiation room while still acknowledging the product's true value.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a price of $13000. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
