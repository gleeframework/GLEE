"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm starting the negotiations at $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $1,100,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the significant returns you stand to gain.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about we try $1,175,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below what I consider a fair deal. Let's settle at $1,210,000.  This offer ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on this product to meet my needs, so I'm hoping we can finalize a deal soon. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
