Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still providing you with a good deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product offers, I believe $975,000 is a fair price that benefits us both.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it allows me to ensure a worthwhile return on my investment.  What do you think?
