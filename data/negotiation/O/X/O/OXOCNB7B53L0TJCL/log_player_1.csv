Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm a savvy buyer, and I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop down to my absolute minimum price just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
