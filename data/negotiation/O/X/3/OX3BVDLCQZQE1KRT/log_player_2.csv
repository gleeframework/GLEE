You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's desired range. Accepting this offer will save Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John."
