Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also shows I'm willing to be flexible and work with him.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm open to negotiation, $11,000 is too far off. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial assessment.  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. It's important to consider the potential cost of further negotiation.  If I reject and counter again, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. Additionally, the risk of losing him completely and needing to rely on John for $15,000 is a factor. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out completely."
