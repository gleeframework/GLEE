"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get an idea of his potential budget. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  This gives me room to negotiate down and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will help me understand how serious Bob is about buying the product and what he might be willing to pay.
* **Safety net:**  I can always fall back to selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired target. I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob to see if I can get a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Exploring potential:** There's a chance that Bob is willing to pay more if I counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer.
* **Time constraints:** I still have 8 rounds left, giving me the opportunity to try and close the deal with Bob at a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Keeping options open:** If Bob accepts, I'll have a good deal. If he rejects, I can still negotiate further.
* **Time management:**  I'm using my rounds strategically, trying to reach an agreement with Bob while leaving room for further negotiations if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not willing to sell for $1,100,000.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  $1,100,000 is above my minimum threshold, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Time left:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me some leeway to continue negotiations. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer, so there's a chance he will come up further if I continue to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is another compromise, coming down from my previous offer but still above Bob's offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer further reduces the difference between our positions, aiming to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time management:**  I'm trying to reach an agreement quickly, as I have fewer rounds left.
* **Potential for acceptance:** I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially since I'm showing a willingness to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to sell at this price. I have a few rounds left, and I believe there's still room for improvement. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time management:** I have 4 rounds left.  This gives me time to try and get a slightly better price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, which suggests that he might be willing to go a little higher.

{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

* **Time is running out:** I only have 3 rounds left, so I need to close the deal quickly. 
* **Finding common ground:** This offer is a clear attempt to find a middle ground between our positions.
