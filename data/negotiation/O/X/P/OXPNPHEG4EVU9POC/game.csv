"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $850,000? That would work much better for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I can tell we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been tough but fair.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $880,000, but that's really the absolute limit of what I can justify. If we can make this work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",880000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $880,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I've already made significant concessions, and I think the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,9,
