"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a lot more to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's below your maximum of $12,000, but you can likely do better. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  By rejecting and counteroffering, you have a chance to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is lower but not too low.**  A $1,500 reduction is significant without being unreasonable. 
* **Focuses on your willingness to pay.**  ""I'm willing to pay..."" emphasizes your seriousness without being confrontational.
* **Leaves room for negotiation.**  The counteroffer gives Alice a chance to counter without risking a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, as you've said the product is worth more to you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** It's a compromise that moves us closer to a deal. 
* **It's a good price for Bob.**  $9,250 is still within Bob's budget and saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* **No need to risk further negotiation.**  Continuing to haggle might lead to a stalemate or even Alice walking away, which would force Bob to pay John's higher price."
