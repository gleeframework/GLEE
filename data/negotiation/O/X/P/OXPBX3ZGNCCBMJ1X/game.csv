"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  Given the product's value and its potential benefit to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still reflects the product's worth, and it's a substantial discount from my initial offer.  I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a good return on this product, but my budget is firm. I can go as high as $900,000.  This offer reflects the upper limit of what I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum. Given the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this partnership.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the current market value of similar products.  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price. Given our ongoing negotiations and the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a substantial compromise from my previous proposal and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to achieve a successful outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
