"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is a bit higher than what Bob is likely willing to pay, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price, leaving room to adjust if needed. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value.

**Next Steps:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  We have 8 rounds remaining, and I can counter-offer and work towards a price that's closer to my minimum. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, it's not the best outcome. I can potentially get a higher price from Bob, especially if he values the product so much that he's willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter-offer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  Given the product's value and its potential benefit to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still reflects the product's worth, and it's a substantial discount from my initial offer.  I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, reflecting the product's value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm re-emphasizing the product's worth and potential benefits to Bob, reminding him of the value he would gain.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a positive tone and language like ""mutually beneficial"" to encourage Bob to see the deal as a win-win.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There is still room to negotiate down if needed, but this price is a strong starting point for the next round.

**Next Steps:** I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction and the remaining rounds. I might be prepared to compromise further if needed, but I'll also be vigilant about my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a good return on this product, but my budget is firm. I can go as high as $900,000.  This offer reflects the upper limit of what I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** I still have 6 rounds remaining, giving me time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum but leaves room for further negotiation. I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring that Bob doesn't walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum. Given the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this partnership."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows a clear willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value this product brings to Bob's business, reminding him of the potential benefits he will gain.
* **Partnership Language:** Using terms like ""partnership"" and ""solution"" emphasizes a collaborative approach and makes Bob feel like we're working together.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer creates a sense of fairness and encourages a sense of compromise.

**Next Steps:** I'll monitor Bob's response carefully.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider whether I'm willing to lower my price further or if it's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the current market value of similar products.  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer, while higher than before, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Rounds remaining:** We have 4 rounds left.  I can still negotiate and potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'm not desperate. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum.  I'll need to be careful to not alienate Bob, but I also need to be firm about my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price. Given our ongoing negotiations and the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a substantial compromise from my previous proposal and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to achieve a successful outcome.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Significant Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""mutually beneficial"" aspect of the deal, making it seem like a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting down to the wire, and I'm making it clear that this might be my final offer.
* **Reasonable Proposal:**  $1,050,000 is still a good price for Bob, considering his initial offer and the value he places on the product. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll observe Bob's response carefully.  If he rejects, I will have to decide whether to sell to John or make one final concession.  However, I'm confident that this offer will be hard for him to refuse."
