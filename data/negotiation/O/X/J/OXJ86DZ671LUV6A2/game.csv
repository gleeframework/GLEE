"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible.  However, I have a budget in mind for this purchase, and your starting price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still allows for a fair profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for something in the middle.  Would you consider $850,000?  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while being within a reasonable range for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
