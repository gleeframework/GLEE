"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is already a significant discount on what this product is worth. Could you possibly do $160? It's a fair offer.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still firm on my budget of $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $125?  I'm really interested in this product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $125.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $140? That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still only able to go up to $110. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",110.0,Bob,6,
