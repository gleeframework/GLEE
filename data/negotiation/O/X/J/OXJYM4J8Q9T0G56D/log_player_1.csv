"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, an exorbitantly high price could scare Bob away and make him question the deal's value.  
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the price (""value and potential,"" ""benefits to your business"") helps frame the offer as reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate, referencing his budget and market value. This suggests there might be room to meet closer to our desired price point. We'll counter-offer to test this."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the value this product brings, especially tailored to your specific needs, is truly unique. I could consider coming down to $1,375,000, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer ($1,400,000 to $1,375,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **High Anchor:**  While conceding, we're still anchoring the price relatively high. Our goal is to slowly nudge the negotiation towards a figure closer to $1,350,000 or higher if possible. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the unique value this product holds for Bob specifically, justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has dropped his offer significantly, and it's now getting close to John's offer. While $1,250,000 is still above our minimum, we need to hold firm to signal that we value the product and that Bob's lowball offer isn't acceptable. There's a real risk of Bob anchoring the negotiations too low if we continue to make large concessions.  It's time to push back and see if he's willing to move closer to our range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value and potential this product offers you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,312,500. This is a fair and final offer on my end."",
""product_price"": 1312500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  The language ""fair and final offer"" signals that we are reaching our limit and are unwilling to negotiate much further.
* **Significant Compromise:** Meeting Bob exactly halfway between the previous two offers demonstrates a willingness to compromise but holds the line against his lowball attempt.
* **Value Focus:** We continue to emphasize the unique value the product offers Bob, hoping to move him away from solely price-based considerations.

This strategy aims to: 
1. **Anchor the negotiation:** By presenting a firm ""final offer,"" we try to reset Bob's expectations above his last offer. 
2. **Maintain profitability:** $1,312,500 is still a significant profit margin above our minimum.
3. **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  This firm offer will reveal if Bob is truly interested in a deal or if he is unwilling to meet us at a reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving the price downwards with relatively small increments. His latest offer of $1,225,000 is only marginally above John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  

At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's negotiation tactics suggest he's aiming for a price very close to John's offer anyway. We're unlikely to gain much more from prolonged back-and-forth.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating with Bob is an opportunity cost. We could be closing the deal with John and securing our minimum acceptable profit.
* **Certainty:** John represents a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000. Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him ultimately walking away, leaving us with nothing. 

It's more strategically sound to secure a sure thing with John than to potentially waste more time and risk losing out on a deal altogether with Bob."
