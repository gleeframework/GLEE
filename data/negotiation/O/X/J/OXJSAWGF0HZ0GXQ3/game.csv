"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I've valued it at $2,000,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,800,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, given your estimated value of $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,600,000. This would still represent a considerable gain for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000 this time. I'm hoping we can get closer to a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
