Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I've valued it at $2,000,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,800,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, given your estimated value of $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant jump from Bob's initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a loss just yet.  I'll counter with a lower price, but one that's still within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible,  $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,600,000. This would still represent a considerable gain for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $1,200,000 this time. I'm hoping we can get closer to a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm starting to feel that reaching an agreement with Bob is unlikely.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my price expectations."
