Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $160. Is that something you'd be interested in?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and my previous offer of $160. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $145? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come close to my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $80.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay."
