"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down in price, especially since you have 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also setting a firm limit. It's unlikely she'll accept this offer on the first try, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I have several rounds left and I want to see if I can negotiate further.  There's a good chance Alice will come down even more, especially if I continue to make reasonable counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,200,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. I believe this offer is high enough to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but low enough to leave room for further negotiation."
