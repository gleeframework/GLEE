"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to gauge his interest with a high initial price. If he's truly interested, he might counter with a lower but still acceptable offer. If he balks, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher return.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
