"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $95 is too high, especially since you know you can get it for $100 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This product is really high quality and I'm sure you'll get your money's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$90 is still too high, but we're getting closer.  Let's see if we can squeeze a little more out of Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get close to your asking price, but $90 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
