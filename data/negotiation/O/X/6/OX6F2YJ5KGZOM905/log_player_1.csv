Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he acknowledged the value of the product. I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  I understand the value of this product to me is higher than $1,500,000.  How about we split the difference -  $1,750,000.  This feels fair to both of us, and allows us to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully. While I appreciate the effort, I would like to counter with $1600000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering my minimum is $1,500,000 and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's better to secure a good price than risk losing out and having to sell to John for my minimum."
