"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I believe it's worth that much to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
