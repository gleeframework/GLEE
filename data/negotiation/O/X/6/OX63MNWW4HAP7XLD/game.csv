,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This is still within my budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate you coming up in your offer. $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $11,500? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",11500.0,Alice,5,
