"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. Bob's counteroffer is a clear indication that he's interested, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. It's a compromise, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's a slight increase, it's still far below my initial asking price and I believe there's more room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that by continuing to reject his offers, he'll come closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,350,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a reasonable price for the product.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
