"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? I think that's fair to both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is a good compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
