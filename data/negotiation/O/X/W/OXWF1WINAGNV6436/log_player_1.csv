Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to accept a counteroffer if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand what you're offering. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to be open to negotiation. By starting with a reasonable offer, you increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my acceptable range, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,150 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us. If you're agreeable, we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10150 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9900. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. While $9,900 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. However, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go much higher. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
