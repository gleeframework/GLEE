Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $180.  I believe this product will really meet your needs, and I want to find a price that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, splitting the difference is a good idea, but we're still a bit far apart. I could do $80, which is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated that $80 is his final offer. This is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially settling for a price that's not beneficial, it's in my best interest to take John's guaranteed offer of $150."
