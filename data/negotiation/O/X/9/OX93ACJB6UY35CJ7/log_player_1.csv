{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than my minimum, but still attractive to Bob since it's lower than what the product is worth to him. This gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I think $85 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $100. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, considering your last offer, I think $90 would be a reasonable price for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $90 is a good price, considering my minimum is $80 and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob at this point."
