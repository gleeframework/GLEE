"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our potential partnership,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
