"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you might be willing to come down. 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The $1,400,000 price is a strong opening offer. It signals that you understand the product's worth to Bob (which is $1,500,000) without immediately dropping to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,400,000. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better deal without risking selling to John at my absolute minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,375,000?"",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong selling price. It splits the difference between Bob's offer and my previous ask.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By staying above $1,350,000, I remain well within a profitable range and signal that I'm not desperate to close the deal at any cost. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:** The message keeps a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
