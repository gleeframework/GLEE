"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this price?",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $8,800 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,150?  This allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",9150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8,900 for the product? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $8,950 for the product? I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,950 is still not quite where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle on $9,050? This is a small step closer to my last offer and allows us to finalize a deal. What do you say?",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,050 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $8,975 for the product? I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8975.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $8,975 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since we only have one round left, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $9,025. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the remaining negotiation time. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",9025.0,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more offer. How about $8,975 for the product? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",8975.0,Bob,10,
