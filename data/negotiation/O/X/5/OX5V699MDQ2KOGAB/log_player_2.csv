"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice is bluffing. She knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to you and that you have an alternative buyer. By saying she has another buyer lined up for $1,200,000 (which is her own valuation), she's trying to pressure you into accepting a higher price.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting her initial offer."
