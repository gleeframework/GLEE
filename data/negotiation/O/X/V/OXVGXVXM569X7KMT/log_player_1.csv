Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want at least $12,000, so this leaves room for you to negotiate upwards. 

I'm aiming to get a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my goal of getting at least $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would love to get more than $9,200, the negotiation is getting tedious and I'm running the risk of Bob walking away altogether. I'm confident I can get my minimum of $12,000 from John, so I'll take his offer and move on."
