"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both agree on it.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $85, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. That's my final offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
