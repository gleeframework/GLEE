"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9000? This is my highest offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $10000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product.  ",10000.0,Bob,4,
