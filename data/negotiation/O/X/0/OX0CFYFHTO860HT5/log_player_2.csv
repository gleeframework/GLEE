"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, so I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This is my highest offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm holding out for a price closer to my maximum of $10,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product.  "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10000 is a significant offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is still higher than my maximum of $10,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we'll reach an agreement. Given the time limit and the fact that John is offering the product for my maximum price, it makes more sense to buy from John.  I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Alice to get the product at the price I want."
