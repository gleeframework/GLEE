"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider coming down to $950,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the value of what I'm offering.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  However, $775,000 is still a significant gap from where I see its value. My final offer is $875,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Alice is holding firm at a price that's not advantageous for you. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk Alice won't budge from her ""final offer.""  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best price for your budget."
