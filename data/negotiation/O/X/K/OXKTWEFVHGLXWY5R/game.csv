"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider coming down to $950,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the value of what I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I want to find a way for us to make this work.  However, $775,000 is still a significant gap from where I see its value. My final offer is $875,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
