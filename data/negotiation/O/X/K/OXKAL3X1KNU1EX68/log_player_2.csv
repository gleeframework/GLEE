"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $950,000 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is too high for Bob. He has a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and can get the product from John for that price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your proposal, we've decided to counter with a price of $900,000. This reflects our belief in the value of the product and its benefits to you. We hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a bit high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can still get the product from John for $1,200,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still above my preferred price point.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, we would like to propose a price of $890,000. We believe this offers a fair compromise between our values and yours. We hope this aligns more closely with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers or become less willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $310,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, and Bob should be happy with the deal."
