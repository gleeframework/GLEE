"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $10,000, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between Alice's value ($8,000) and my maximum value ($9,000). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it shows I'm serious about buying but also aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price, but it's still above my maximum value of $9,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  If I reject, I might be able to get her to come down closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying and willing to compromise, but it's still below her current offer of $9,200.  This leaves room for further negotiation and potentially a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is now higher than my maximum value of $9,000.  It seems she's unwilling to come down in price, and continuing to negotiate will likely only result in further price increases from her. Buying from John at $10,000 is a better option than accepting Alice's offer."
