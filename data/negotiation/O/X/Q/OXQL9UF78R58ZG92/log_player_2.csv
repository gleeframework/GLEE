"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,750,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will far exceed the price. This offer is valid for the next 24 hours, after which I'll be moving forward with another buyer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,750,000 for the product. That's $250,000 more than what John is willing to sell it to me for. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John instead.
