Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still providing me with a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure the Sale:**  While I have a backup buyer, it's always better to secure the best price with the first potential buyer."
