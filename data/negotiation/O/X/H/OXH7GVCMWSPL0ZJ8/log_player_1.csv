Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she also needs to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to price it above that but below her own valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $1,150,000, there might be room for a slight negotiation downward if Bob is hesitant. 

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback option with John, which gives her leverage in this negotiation."
