Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us working to find common ground. However, to be completely transparent,  $1,075,000 is cutting it too close. My absolute lowest price is $1,190,000. This offer takes into account our discussions and represents the final price I'm willing to accept.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to go below $1,190,000, and that's too rich for your budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, saving you at least $190,000."
