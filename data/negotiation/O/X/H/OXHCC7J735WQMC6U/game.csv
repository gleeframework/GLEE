"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $800,000 range. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can do $900,000.  That's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm motivated to find an agreement with you on this. To show that, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us working to find common ground. However, to be completely transparent,  $1,075,000 is cutting it too close. My absolute lowest price is $1,190,000. This offer takes into account our discussions and represents the final price I'm willing to accept.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
