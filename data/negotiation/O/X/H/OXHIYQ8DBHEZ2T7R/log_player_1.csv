"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and shows that I'm serious about getting a good price. I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm aiming for a price that is within a reasonable range for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my offer to $12,000, still above Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but remain firm about my product's value.  By moving closer to his offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but we're getting closer. I'm not quite ready to accept yet, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a price that is mutually agreeable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,500, which is halfway between my last offer of $12,000 and Bob's current offer of $11,000. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal and willing to compromise. It also puts the pressure on Bob to make the next move and hopefully close the gap."
