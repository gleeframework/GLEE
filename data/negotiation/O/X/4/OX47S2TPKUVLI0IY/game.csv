"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its worth to me.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation.  Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is lower than I initially hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $850,000?  This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value of the product, and it's a fair midpoint between our initial positions.  I'm eager to work with you, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly.",850000.0,Alice,3,
