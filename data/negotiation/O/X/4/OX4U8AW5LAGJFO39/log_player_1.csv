{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I can still do better. I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I think that would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
