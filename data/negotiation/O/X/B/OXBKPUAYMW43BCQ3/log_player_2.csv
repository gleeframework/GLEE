"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
