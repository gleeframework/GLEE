# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $11,000. I've already told you that my minimum price is $11,500, and I'm not willing to go below that. I'm starting to think that we're not going to reach a deal, and I'll have to consider other options. However, I'm still open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try $11,250 again.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round. Bob has exhausted his negotiation options with Alice.  He's already offered $11,000, which Alice rejected.  Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still too high for Bob, who is determined to save as much money as possible. Therefore, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $12,000, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer."
