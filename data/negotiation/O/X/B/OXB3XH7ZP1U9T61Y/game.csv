"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $80.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",80.5,Alice,5,
