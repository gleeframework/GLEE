"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  Given our previous discussions and my budget, I'm willing to pay $8,250. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
