Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $14,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close to the halfway point, and further haggling might not yield much more. Accepting $13,000 secures a decent profit above the fallback option of John."
