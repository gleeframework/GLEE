"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below my asking price.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $15,000? This product truly delivers exceptional value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $14,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
