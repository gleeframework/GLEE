"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason: Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $108, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Reason:  Bob is still trying to save money. While $108 is better than $110 or $120, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, so he should reject the offer and continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little hesitant at $108.  Would you be willing to come down to $107?  That would be a great compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $109, which is even closer to your target. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Reason:  Bob is getting closer to his ideal price.  While $109 is still above his preferred $105, he's only $4 away from that target. Given the limited rounds remaining, it's likely Alice will not come down further. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, minimizing his risk of losing the deal."
