"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There are 8 rounds left, which gives me ample time to improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit closer to my minimum.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can do better with more negotiation. I have 6 rounds remaining, which is sufficient time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I believe Bob understands the value of the product and is likely to accept this offer, given that it is higher than his previous offer.  I'm confident that we can close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult.  Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum price, and I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  To ensure I receive my minimum value for the product, I will sell to John for $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I cannot risk losing out on a valuable opportunity by continuing a protracted negotiation."
