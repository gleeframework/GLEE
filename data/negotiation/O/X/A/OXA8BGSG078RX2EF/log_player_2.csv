"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's room for both parties to find a price that works for them.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However,  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we try $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's within Bob's budget of $15,000.  It also shows Alice is willing to compromise, which is a positive sign.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away or getting stuck with John's higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most practical and financially beneficial option at this point."
