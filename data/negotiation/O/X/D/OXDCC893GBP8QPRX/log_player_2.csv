"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While it's a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm ready to pay $8,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,250 compared to buying from John, while still ensuring a successful purchase."
