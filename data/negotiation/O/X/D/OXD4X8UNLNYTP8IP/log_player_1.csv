I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $88. I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be careful not to lose the deal entirely.  I'll try to see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John. Bob is clearly not going to budge, and I'm running out of time. While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, I'm not going to risk losing the deal completely. Selling to John for $80 is better than getting nothing, and I can still make a profit."
