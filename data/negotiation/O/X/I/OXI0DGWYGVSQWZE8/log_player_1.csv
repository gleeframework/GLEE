Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still aiming to keep my investment under $10,000. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $10,000 limit. Accepting his offer of $9,500 is a loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Continuing negotiations risks missing out on John's offer entirely."
