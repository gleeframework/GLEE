"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a profit."
