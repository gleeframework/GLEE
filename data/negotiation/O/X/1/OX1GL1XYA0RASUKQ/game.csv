"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest in this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it. This price is still very attractive for me, and I'm confident it would be a great deal for you as well. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe this price is still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to save a bit of money, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1125000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
