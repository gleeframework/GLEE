"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. There's potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe this price is still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save a bit of money, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1125000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The price is getting closer to Bob's ideal:** Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
* **The risk of going higher:**  If Bob rejects this offer and makes another counteroffer, there's a chance Alice might walk away from the negotiation altogether.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's current offer.

While Bob could try to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price within Bob's budget and limits further risk."
