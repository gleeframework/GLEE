"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a good profit on this sale. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while also giving me a great price.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
