Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while also giving me a great price.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
