"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $125, which would be $137.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $137.50 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $110, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you $130, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Would you be willing to consider this price?",130.0,Alice,5,
