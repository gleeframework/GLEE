Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,150,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,200,000. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a higher price.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product for a price between your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,200,000) creates a win-win scenario.  
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while leaving him with a perceived gain ($50,000). 

**Important:** This is just one potential offer. You could adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's willingness to negotiate."
