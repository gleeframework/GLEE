Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $6,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm committed to making a deal, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $8,750. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.
