"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a very competitive price considering its features and benefits.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $7,200. I believe that's a fair offer considering similar products on the market.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $10,500? This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm committed to making a deal, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $8,750. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
