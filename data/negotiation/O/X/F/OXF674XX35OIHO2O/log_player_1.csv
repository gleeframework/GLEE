Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a classic negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he brings the price down. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, you anchor the negotiation around a higher value, making it more likely that Bob's counteroffer will still be within a range acceptable to you.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives you a strong fallback position and allows you to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum and what John is offering. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to guide the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $900,000 undervalues the true capabilities of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which reflects its significant potential for return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You've made a significant concession from your initial price, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're justifying the higher price by emphasizing the product's value and ROI.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation but keeps you well above your $1,000,000 fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:**  Bob has made it clear that $950,000 is his upper limit. He's unlikely to move significantly from this point.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gain from Bob ($50,000 at most) is minimal compared to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's offer altogether. It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
