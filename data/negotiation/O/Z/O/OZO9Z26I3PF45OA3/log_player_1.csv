Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting strong by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price and might encourage him to negotiate a bit rather than immediately rejecting the offer.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own price. I still believe we can reach a deal, but I need to be firm in my negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value to me. It's also a significant improvement from Bob's offer, hopefully encouraging him to move closer to my ideal price.  Let's see if this offer is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his last one, it's still far too low for me. I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer again and continue to negotiate, hoping to reach a more acceptable price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,050,000. This is a substantial drop from my previous counteroffer, but I need to be flexible. I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, which hopefully makes him more inclined to accept.  I'm hoping this move shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal while still securing a price that's relatively close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm not willing to settle for such a loss. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate.  We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, and I believe we can still reach a deal that's favorable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to make a final push for $1,000,000. This is Bob's perceived value for the product, so it's likely the highest price he's willing to pay. It's also a significant step down from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this price and accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to move on to John to secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer, while slightly better, is still below what I'm willing to accept. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed price from John. While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I need to prioritize my financial goals."
