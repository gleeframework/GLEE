"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a quick deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum price, leaving room to negotiate in case Bob rejects.
* **Building rapport:** I'm starting with a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to counteroffer at $12,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More negotiation is possible:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a good option:**  However, I don't want to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $13,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my budget, I am comfortable proceeding with a counteroffer of $12,500 for your product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Not enough time to waste:** We're already in round 4, and I need to get closer to my desired price quickly.
* **John is a good backup:**  While I'd prefer to get a better price from Bob, I need to be realistic about the time remaining.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also getting ready to sell to John if Bob doesn't get closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still too far from my desired price. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price reflects the product's value and offers a fair deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final attempt at a compromise. I'm dropping to $13,000, but this is still a better deal for me than John's offer.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 5, and I need to close the deal soon.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer.
* **Positive and Collaborative:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, and I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
