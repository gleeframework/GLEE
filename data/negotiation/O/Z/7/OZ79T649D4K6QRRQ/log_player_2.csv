This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  You're well below your $1,500,000 maximum, and the price is getting close to the point where further haggling might not yield much more.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Alice stating this is her final offer suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Time Limit:** You have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to push might lead to impasse.

While you could try for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's higher offer is probably not worth it at this point."
