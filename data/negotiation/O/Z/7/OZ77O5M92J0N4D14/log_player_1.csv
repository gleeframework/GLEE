"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I'm framing the deal as beneficial for both of us, emphasizing fairness. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's enough room for Bob to counter without me feeling like I'm giving away too much.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also creating a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, so accepting Bob's offer is not an option.
* **Selling to John is also not ideal.** While it guarantees a sale, I can potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **Rejection opens the door for negotiation.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, potentially finding a middle ground.

This decision keeps me in the negotiation, allowing me to continue pursuing a higher price while also ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can go down to $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically. This keeps me within my desired range while acknowledging Bob's position.
* **Highlight the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing why $13,000 is a reasonable price.
* **""Meet in the middle"" framing:** This language suggests a collaborative approach, making it less likely Bob will feel pressured.

This approach aims to find a mutually agreeable price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less. How about $12,500? It's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Selling to John is still not ideal:** I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000, so selling to John for $10,000 is not the best option at this point.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're still in the early rounds, and there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can push for a higher price.

This decision allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate while staying within my desired range. 
* **""Meet Halfway"" Framing:**  This language further emphasizes a collaborative approach, making it more likely Bob will feel we're working together to find a solution.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing why this price is fair.

By offering a small compromise while keeping the negotiation focused on value, I aim to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer and close the deal."
