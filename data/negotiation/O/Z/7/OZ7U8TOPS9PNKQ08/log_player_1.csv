Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since the product is worth more to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a good price, and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about we meet halfway at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, $115 is still a good deal for me, considering that John is willing to buy it for $120. It's a win-win situation - Bob gets a good deal, and I get to sell the product without having to spend more time negotiating."
