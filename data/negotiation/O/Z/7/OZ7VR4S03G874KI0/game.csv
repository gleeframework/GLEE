"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,800,000? I appreciate your consideration.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
