Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it leaves some room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay that much!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be agreeable to Bob while still allowing me to earn a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $125 is still a good profit and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. I'd rather secure the sale than risk another round of negotiation."
