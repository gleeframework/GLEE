Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it.  This price is fair given the product's worth and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
