"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be a significant asset to you. We are offering this remarkable item to you for $1200000. We are confident that this price reflects both the product's worth and the opportunity it presents. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss further, please do not hesitate to reach out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're looking to pay no more than $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always buy from John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Alice fail, so you have leverage to push for a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the negotiation process and can try to secure a lower price."
