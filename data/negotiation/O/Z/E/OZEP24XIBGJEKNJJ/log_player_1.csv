"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a starting price of $1,500,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, I feel I can likely get more from Bob, or potentially John if I don't make a deal.  I'm going to counter-offer and see where things go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is a starting point, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000.  This gives us both some room to negotiate, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to counter-offer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for me, while also being within a reasonable range for your budget. I'm open to further negotiation, but this is my final offer before considering other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is close to my minimum. However, I've already made several concessions and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Given the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and the potential for a stalemate, I'm going to choose to sell to John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees me a good return and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
