"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? This would be a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $887,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",875000.0,Bob,6,
