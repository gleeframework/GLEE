"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? This would be a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $887,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  we're running out of rounds. Selling to Bob for $875,000 is still a better deal than selling to John for $800,000."
