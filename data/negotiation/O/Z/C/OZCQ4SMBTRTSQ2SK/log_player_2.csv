"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** While it's more expensive, it's good to know you have another option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $90?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $95. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and her offer is $95.
* **It's a good compromise.** While you'd prefer a lower price, this offer is reasonable and avoids further negotiation.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** There's no need to pay the higher price when you've reached a good deal with Alice."
