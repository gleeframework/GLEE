"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $90?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $95. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",95.0,Alice,3,
