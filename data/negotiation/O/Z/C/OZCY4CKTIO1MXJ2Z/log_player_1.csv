Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" aims to encourage Bob to make a quick decision and potentially avoid losing out.

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the potential buyer can lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable approach."
