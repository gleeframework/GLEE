"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $700,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards this number.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
