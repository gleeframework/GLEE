Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $87.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price,  Bob's offer of $87.50 is a good deal considering he's my only buyer at this point.  It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation."
