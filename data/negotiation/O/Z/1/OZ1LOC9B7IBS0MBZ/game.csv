"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price reflects the significant value the product offers, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am unable to agree to $1,350,000. However, I would like to propose an offer of $1,320,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range while also respecting my budget constraints.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
