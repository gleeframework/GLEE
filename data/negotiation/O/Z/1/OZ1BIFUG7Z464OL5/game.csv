"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a more substantial investment. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which is still a significant discount from its true value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
