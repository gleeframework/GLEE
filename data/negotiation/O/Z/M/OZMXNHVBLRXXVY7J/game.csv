"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and also allows for a fair margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering the original worth of the product to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to increase your bid, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the original worth of the product to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
