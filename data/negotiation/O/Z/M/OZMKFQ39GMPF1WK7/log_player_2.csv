"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in buying it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100**, which is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* You can save $20 compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
