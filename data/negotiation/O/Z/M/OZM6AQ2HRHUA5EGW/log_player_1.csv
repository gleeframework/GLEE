"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. While there might be a slight chance of getting more from Bob, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
