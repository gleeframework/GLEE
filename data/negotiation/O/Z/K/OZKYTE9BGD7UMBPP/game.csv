"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $6,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
