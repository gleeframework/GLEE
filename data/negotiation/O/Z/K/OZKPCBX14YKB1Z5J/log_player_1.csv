I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 while hopefully still being enticing enough for Bob to consider. I'm eager to see how he responds and will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's lowball offer, I'm not ready to settle for my minimum price just yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial target, it's only $50,000 less than what John would pay.  It's likely that Bob won't budge much further, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's offer. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
