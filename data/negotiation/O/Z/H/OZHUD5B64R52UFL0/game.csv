"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
