"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,225,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,225,000. How about we meet in the middle again, at $1,212,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1212500.0,Bob,4,
