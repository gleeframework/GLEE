"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, and a counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant step towards his goal of $1,000,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it leaves some room for compromise.  While Alice may reject this offer, it puts pressure on her to reduce her price and potentially move closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his target price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to try and get a lower price.  He can either counter-offer again or, if he's feeling confident, potentially wait to see if Alice will reduce her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum budget, and this offer represents his final attempt to close the deal with Alice.  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, which is the same price as buying from John. By offering this price, he's essentially giving Alice an ultimatum: accept this offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than Bob's maximum budget, but it's still a bit higher than he's willing to pay. There are only 5 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might not lead to a better deal. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product at a known price with John. This guarantees him the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Alice that could ultimately be unsuccessful."
