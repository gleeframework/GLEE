Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,999 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price and might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide if it's worth accepting or going with John."
