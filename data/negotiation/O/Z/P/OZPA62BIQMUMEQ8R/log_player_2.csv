"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $10000. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $9,500.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, given the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount from its value to you, while also ensuring a fair return for me. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Alice is willing to sell for less than her own valuation, indicating a willingness to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if he can get a price closer to his ideal range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $8900 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between the value you place on the product and the cost for me. I believe this offer will be agreeable to both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is a significant saving for Bob compared to John's price of $10,000. While there might be a possibility of pushing for an even lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer at $8,900 secures a good deal for Bob."
