"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to accept, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92. While it's still a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering the time already spent negotiating and the risk of getting stuck with the lower price from John. It's important to balance potential gains with the time and energy invested in the negotiation."
