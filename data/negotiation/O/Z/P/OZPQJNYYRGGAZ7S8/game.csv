"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $10,500, but that's my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'll make one more serious counteroffer, $12,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
