**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems stuck at a price point significantly higher than my target. She's gone back to her original offer of $12,000, signaling she might not be willing to budge much further.  At this point, it's unlikely I'll get a deal significantly better than John's $15,000 offer.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
