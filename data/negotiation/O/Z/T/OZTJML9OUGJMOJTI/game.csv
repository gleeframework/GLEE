"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $170? That's a pretty significant discount.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still a bit far off on the price. How about $125? That's a fair compromise, I think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $150 for it.  How about $145? That's my final offer.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I understand it's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $135, and we close this deal?",135.0,Bob,6,
