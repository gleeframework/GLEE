"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's close this quickly!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm also emphasizing the potential for a quick deal to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to the value I place on the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to let go of the product for that price yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This is still a great value for you, and we can finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I still feel that we could find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to counter with $800,000, which aligns closely with what I value the product at. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation further. Accepting Bob's offer secures the best possible outcome for me."
