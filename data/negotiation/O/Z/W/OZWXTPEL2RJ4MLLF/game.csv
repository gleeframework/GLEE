"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with immense value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $725,000? I think that's a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $800,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
