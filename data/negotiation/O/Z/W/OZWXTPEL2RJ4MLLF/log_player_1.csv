Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with immense value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $650,000 is a significant sum, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price.  I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or potentially reach an agreement with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves a good margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $725,000? I think that's a fair offer that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, $725,000 is still significantly less than my desired price. I'm committed to earning as much as possible for this valuable product. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the $1,200,000 offer from John."
