"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,500 right now.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'll try to get a counter-offer from Bob that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need a bit more than that.  How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's work together on this!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, I might not be able to get a better price. I also have to consider that John is willing to pay $15,000, but that might be a risk with the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.  It's time to take the deal and move on."
