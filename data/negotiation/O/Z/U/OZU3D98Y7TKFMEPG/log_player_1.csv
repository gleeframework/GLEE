"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  By setting the price at $100, I allow for a potential counter-offer from Bob without dropping below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Although Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to explore whether I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiations fail. This gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, but still above his initial offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price point, but not compromising my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counter-offer to keep the negotiation respectful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $75 is still significantly below my minimum value of $120.
* **Negotiation continues:** There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If the negotiations fail, I have the option of selling to John for $120. This keeps me in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing the discussion.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($85) and Bob's offer ($75). This shows a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us. This helps Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Confidence in the product:** I'm expressing confidence in the product to further encourage Bob."
