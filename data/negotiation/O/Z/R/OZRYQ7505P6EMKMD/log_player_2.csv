"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and while my absolute minimum price is $1,000,000, I'm willing to open negotiations at $950,000. This offer won't last long, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price. While Alice states $1,000,000 is her minimum, she's likely willing to negotiate further to avoid losing the sale. You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."
