"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a fair price considering the quality and potential of this product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
