"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I'm asking for $22,000, which reflects its true value and the benefit it will bring to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a fair price considering the quality and potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm at a price far too low. It's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my minimum, and I risk losing a guaranteed sale to John if I continue to negotiate with Bob."
