Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value, also your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob away. Aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal but also leaves a significant portion of the profit for you.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product while offering you a great opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's friendly, acknowledges the value to Bob, and positions the price as carefully considered.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain if he accepts, a strong incentive. You, in turn, gain a significant $150,000 profit. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start a bit lower to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, offering a slightly better deal might be beneficial.
