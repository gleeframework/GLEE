"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $88. That's a fair price, and it's closer to my budget. What do you think?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer you $90, which is the best I can do. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
