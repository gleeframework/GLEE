# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
