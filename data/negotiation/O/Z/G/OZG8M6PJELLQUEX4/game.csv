"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $6,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go below $8,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $7,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,5,
