"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. My starting price is $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive opening:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I can likely get a better price through further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  I can afford to play it cautiously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but I'm also not rejecting him outright. I'm showing flexibility by suggesting a compromise. 
* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting $9,250, I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and how it's worth the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **We're getting closer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, so there's potential for a successful negotiation.
* **More room for negotiation:** I have 6 more rounds left, so I can continue to push for a higher price.

**I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I'm confident I can secure a better price from Bob.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $9,100.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate by coming down slightly from my previous offer.
* **Create urgency:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer, subtly increasing the pressure for him to accept.
* **Leave some room for compromise:**  While $9,100 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit higher than Bob's offer. This gives us both a little room to maneuver."
