"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a significant gain for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price given my limited budget. I hope you will reconsider.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
