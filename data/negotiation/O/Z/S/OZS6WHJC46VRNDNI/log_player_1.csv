"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for concessions while still aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Starting closer to this figure increases the chance he'll consider it seriously. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,150,000 provides a $50,000 buffer for potential counteroffers, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,200,000. We have room to negotiate, especially since we're only in Round 2.  It's too early to settle for an offer that leaves so much potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,050,000). This signals flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Strong but Reasonable:**  $1,100,000 is still a strong price, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin. It acknowledges Bob's counteroffer without conceding too much too quickly.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By offering a clear compromise, we aim to keep the negotiation moving forward and encourage Bob to engage constructively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  To make this work for me, I need to be around $1,025,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy.  However, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Accepting $1,025,000 would leave a significant portion of potential profit untapped. We can afford to counter and aim for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $25,000, which is a smaller concession than our previous moves. This signals we're getting closer to our desired price point.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" and ""true value"" reinforces the product's worth and justifies the higher price point.
* **Encouraging a Deal:** By offering a specific price, we're prompting Bob to make a concrete decision while still leaving room for slight negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to close this deal soon, but I need the price to be right. Would you consider $1,040,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, his latest increase was smaller. This suggests he might be nearing his maximum.  We'll push slightly further, but we're getting close to the point where accepting might be the best option.  We also need to be mindful of the risk of Bob walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product and are close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1060000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making a smaller concession ($15,000) and presenting this as our ""final offer."" This adds a sense of urgency and signals we're reaching our limit.
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the ""significant discount,"" we remind Bob of the advantageous deal he's getting.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above John's offer ($1,000,000). However, we're getting closer to the point where accepting Bob's next offer might be the safest option, even if it's slightly below our ideal target."
