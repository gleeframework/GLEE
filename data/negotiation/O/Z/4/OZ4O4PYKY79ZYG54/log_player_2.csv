"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,550,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you and provides me with a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. While you could accept Alice's offer, it's only $50,000 more than what you'd pay John.  It's not a significant enough savings to justify the extra risk."
