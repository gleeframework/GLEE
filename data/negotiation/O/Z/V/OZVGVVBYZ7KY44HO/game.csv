"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite accept that offer.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
