Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $10,000 from John. The offer to Bob needs to be significantly better than this to be worthwhile."
