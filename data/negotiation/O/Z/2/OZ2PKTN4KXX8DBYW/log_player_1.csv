Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given the unique nature of this product and its potential, I believe this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value, attempting to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., if he's known to be extremely price-sensitive), you might adjust your initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob pushes back. You can always lower the price slightly, but you've set a strong anchor at $1,500,000."
