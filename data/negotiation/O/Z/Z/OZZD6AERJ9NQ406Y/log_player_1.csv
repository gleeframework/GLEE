Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is $8,000,  we start higher to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal than our guaranteed $10,000 from John.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we subtly anchor the price to a higher point without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value is wrong.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price too high. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. We need to be prepared to adjust our approach based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the offer, we have room to negotiate down towards his $8,000 limit, knowing we have a $10,000 backup."
