Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while still making the sale. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $100 (Bob's value) or less leaves money on the table.
* **Below Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $150 from John, so going below that makes no sense.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $140 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above his $100 value but below your $150 guarantee. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
