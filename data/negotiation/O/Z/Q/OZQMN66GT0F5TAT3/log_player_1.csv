"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob a sense that there's a possible deal to be made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is quite high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, considering your interest in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must stick to my maximum budget of $8,000. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is sticking to his offer of $8,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made a concession in the previous round, and I'm not willing to go any lower. At this point, it's better for me to sell the product to John for $12,000, which guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
