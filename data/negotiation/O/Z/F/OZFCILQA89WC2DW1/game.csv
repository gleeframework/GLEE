"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We're looking for a serious buyer who appreciates its value, and I believe you fit the bill. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $550,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $550,000 is still a bit low for us. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle at $650,000? That's a significant step from my last offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $650,000 is still a bit too low for us. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with an offer of $850,000. This is a final compromise that takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the concessions you've made so far. However, we're still a bit apart. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose $725,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're serious about selling, and I'm definitely still interested. How about we settle this at $775,000?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal today.",775000.0,Bob,8,
