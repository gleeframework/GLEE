"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $14,500, which is a significant compromise from my last offer. Let's finalize this deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
