"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for around $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $18,000. It's too expensive, so Bob should reject the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $15,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he still has a few rounds left.  While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $14,500, which is a significant compromise from my last offer. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
