{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to drop to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we revisit the $12,500 price point, and I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, which normally costs $500? This way, you'll get the full value of the product, and I'll get the price I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While the extra warranty sounds appealing, I've had enough of this negotiation.  Bob is being stubborn, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's a sure thing, and I'm confident that I'll make the most money by taking this deal."
