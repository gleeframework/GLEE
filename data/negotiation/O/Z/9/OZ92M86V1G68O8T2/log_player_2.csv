"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed, but also signals that I'm looking for a price closer to the product's actual value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $70 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $85 is still above my target price. I'll reject and counteroffer again to aim for something lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to Alice's likely bottom line while still trying to secure a good discount. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to do $80? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her bottom line, which is also the product's actual value to her.  There's no point in negotiating further, as I likely won't get a better price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable discount."
