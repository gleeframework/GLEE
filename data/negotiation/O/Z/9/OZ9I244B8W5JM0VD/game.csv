"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
