"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $95. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $95 is within your budget, you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John will sell it to you for $100, but there's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer."
