"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I'm confident this price still provides you with a good value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
