Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! My price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to come up a little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could accept his offer and get something, I want to see if we can find a middle ground. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still sticking to his original offer, which is below my minimum price.  I'm not willing to go that low, so I'll reject his offer again and try one more counteroffer.  If he doesn't budge, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $100, but I'm really not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
