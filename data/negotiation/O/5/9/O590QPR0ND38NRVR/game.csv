"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still takes into account the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit margin.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a very fair offer, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
