"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $135, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not giving away too much value. 
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value of $150.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $150, I believe I can get closer to that amount through further negotiation. 

I'm confident in my ability to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Reinforcing value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Open ended question:** The question encourages Bob to consider the offer and respond positively. 

I believe this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $122.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $150. 
* **Risk of settling for too low:** Accepting this offer would mean selling the product for less than I believe it's worth.
* **Potential for better price:** There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.

I'm going to make another counteroffer to Bob and try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $122.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $128, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal - I think this is a great price for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Finality:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by mentioning that it's a fair compromise for both of us and emphasizing that this is a good price for him.
* **Confidence:** I express confidence in the price and suggest closing the deal.

This counteroffer is a good balance between getting closer to Bob's price while still protecting my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking for a better price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  We're halfway through the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum value.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob will result in further concessions that I'm not comfortable with. 
* **Guaranteed price:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $150.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's important to recognize that I have a backup option that ensures I get a fair price for my product."
