# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $87? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is a good compromise. It's within your budget, and you're likely to save more money than if you bought from John.  It's a fair deal considering your initial counteroffer of $85."
