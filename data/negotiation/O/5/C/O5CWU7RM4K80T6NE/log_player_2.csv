"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal for you at $10,000. You can definitely do better.  Let's try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for some profit for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit too high for you. You're very close to your target price of $8,000. Let's see if you can get Alice to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for closer to my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good middle ground for us both.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the value I have in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $9,250 is still too high. You're willing to pay $9,000, and there's still room for Alice to make a profit.  Let's see if you can get her to agree to your offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and we're very close to making a deal.  I think it's in both of our best interests to close this now.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $9,000. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $9,100. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're getting close to your target price, but Alice is still holding firm.  It's likely you won't be able to negotiate her down to $9,000, and you've already spent several rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John to ensure you get the product at your target price."
