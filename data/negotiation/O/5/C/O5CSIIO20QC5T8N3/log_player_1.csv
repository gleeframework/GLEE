``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm also leaving room for potential counter-offers and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth selling the product for that amount, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher.  If he won't budge, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $10,150 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,150, which would be $10,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've reached the point where I'm not willing to negotiate further.  I'm happy with the guaranteed $12,000 from John and don't want to risk getting less from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
