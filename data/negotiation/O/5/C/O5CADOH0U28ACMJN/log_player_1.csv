Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to your operations, offering significant potential for growth.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us a starting point for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to sell as close to John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for us. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Adding a sense of urgency and exclusivity might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential approach. There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at a higher price, we are in a strong negotiating position."
