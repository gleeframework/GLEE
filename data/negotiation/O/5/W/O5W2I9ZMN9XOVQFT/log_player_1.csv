"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to negotiate a better deal.

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that the product's value justifies a lower price. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough decision point. Bob's offer now matches what John is offering. There's a chance to potentially make more with Bob, but continuing the negotiation carries risk.

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** This guarantees the same amount as John's offer. It's the safe choice.
* **Rejecting and Counter Offering:** We could try for a slightly higher price than $800,000, but there's no guarantee Bob will agree. He might be firm at this price.
* **Selling to John:** This is the same outcome as accepting Bob's offer right now.

Considering the factors, the best option here is to:

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While it would be nice to earn a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $800,000 guarantees the same amount John is offering without the risk of further negotiation."
