"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  The product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for both parties to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $135. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, making it a potentially profitable deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered her price by $5.  Bob is still in a good position to negotiate further and hopefully reach a price closer to his desired range.  Since he has more rounds to go, it's worth seeing if he can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $135.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $135. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal and isn't willing to budge too much. It also sets the stage for a potential compromise in the following rounds."
