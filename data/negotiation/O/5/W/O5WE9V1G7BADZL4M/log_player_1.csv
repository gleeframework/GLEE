Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for it. I feel this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and that you're looking for a price closer to your minimum.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is pushing my budget constraints.  I'd be willing to go to $700,000 to get this deal done.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.
