Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so that's your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's valuation and your backup option."
