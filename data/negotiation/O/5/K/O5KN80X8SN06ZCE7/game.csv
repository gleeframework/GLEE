"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, that's still not quite there for me.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise and allows us both to make a deal.  I'm open to discussing further, but I don't want to go lower than that.",8500.0,Alice,5,
