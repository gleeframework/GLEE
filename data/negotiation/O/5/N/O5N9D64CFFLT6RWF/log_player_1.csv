Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I'd like to make you an offer of $150 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on a sale and can still meet my minimum price."
