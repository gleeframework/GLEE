Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategic offer to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could start lower, aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a quicker deal. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John gives us a strong position. We're not desperate, allowing us to hold firm on a price that reflects the product's true worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to be a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the initial offer, but not below $1,250,000.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly more generous offer could be considered to foster goodwill."
