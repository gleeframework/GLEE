Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Appeal to Value:** By mentioning a ""special price,"" you aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a unique opportunity. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale at your minimum price."
