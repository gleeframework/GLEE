"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1200000, considering your enthusiasm. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
