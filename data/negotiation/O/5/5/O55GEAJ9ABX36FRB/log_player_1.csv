Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for myself. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a good margin for myself. I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing him by pushing for a higher price. It's better to secure the sale now and ensure a profit."
