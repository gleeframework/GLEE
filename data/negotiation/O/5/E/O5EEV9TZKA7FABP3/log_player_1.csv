Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $150, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value of $120. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation, allowing me to adjust the price if needed. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll need to assess Bob's reactions and adjust my strategy as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for the absolute minimum right away. 

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially get a price closer to my initial offer of $150. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm gauging how motivated he is to buy the product. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $120 and $150. I'll also consider factors like Bob's financial constraints and the urgency of selling the product to determine my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still allows me to make a fair profit while recognizing your budget concerns.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $135 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This price still ensures I make a profit above my minimum value of $120.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message acknowledges Bob's budget while emphasizing the product's value, hoping to convince him to pay a bit more.

**Important Note:** This is still a strategic move.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $115 is below my minimum value of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that allows me to meet my minimum.  Furthermore, John is already offering my minimum value, making this a risk-free option. 

* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take more time and effort, which could be better spent pursuing other potential buyers.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose money on the transaction. 

**Conclusion:**

While I initially hoped to get a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible and efficient option at this point."
