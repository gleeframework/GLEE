Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair price given the potential value you'll gain.  What do you think?

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a little too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $1150000 is still a bit below what I need to consider.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a final compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if you're able to meet me there.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is the same price as John's, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to John."
