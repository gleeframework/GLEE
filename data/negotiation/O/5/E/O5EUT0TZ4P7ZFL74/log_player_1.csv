Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance I can secure a better price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a loss for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,250,000 is still below my ideal target. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get closer to my desired price. Selling to John at this point would be a loss for me, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,280,000 is still below what I'm aiming for. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe there's potential for a better deal. Selling to John now would mean losing out on a higher potential profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000.  How about we compromise at $1,320,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close to the end of the negotiations. While $1,290,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have two rounds left to try and secure a better deal with Bob.  Selling to John at this point would mean a loss for me, so I'm going to continue negotiating."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,320,000. Considering the value of this product and the limited time left, how about we settle on $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations. While Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is higher than his previous offers, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have no room to negotiate further and it's a risk to keep negotiating with Bob, as he is aware of my alternative buyer, John.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option to ensure I don't lose any money and secure a guaranteed sale."
