"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it's worth a lot to someone like you. I think $14,000 is a fair price, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's important to note that buying from John is always an option, but it's the least desirable outcome, as it's the highest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, making it seem like a genuine attempt to reach a compromise. 
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:** While $12,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, it's still above her minimum, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There is room for compromise as Alice is willing to negotiate and has already lowered her price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying from John at $15,000 is too risky at this point.  There's a good chance that Bob can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still aiming for a slightly lower number.  Would you consider $13,000?  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:** Bob is making a small adjustment to Alice's offer, showing that he's serious about negotiating but also being reasonable. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** Bob highlights that $13,000 is a good price for both parties, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Building Confidence:**  Bob expresses confidence in closing the deal, demonstrating his commitment to finalizing the transaction."
