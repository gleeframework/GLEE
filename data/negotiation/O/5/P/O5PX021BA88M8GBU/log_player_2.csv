"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's well above my maximum budget of $800,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept an offer that's already outside my range. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I believe we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfortable range. I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I believe I can still push for a lower price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one, but still within my budget, hoping to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to offer $910,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to go as low as $910,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to drop below $920,000.  We've been going back and forth, and it's likely to continue.  I've only got 3 rounds left, and at this point, I'm too close to my maximum budget to risk further negotiation.  Buying from John at $800,000 ensures I get the product and stay within my financial limits."
