"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I can offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final counteroffer.",8100.0,Alice,5,
