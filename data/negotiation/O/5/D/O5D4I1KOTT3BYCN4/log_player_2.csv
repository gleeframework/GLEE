{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,500 is less than $12,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision for Bob."
