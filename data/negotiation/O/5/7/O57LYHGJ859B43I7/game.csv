"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my willingness to purchase.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I'm counteroffering $9,500, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to meet your minimum requirement, but $9,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering $9,750, which is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9750.0,Alice,7,
