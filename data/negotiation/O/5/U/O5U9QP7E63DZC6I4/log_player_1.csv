Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my research and the product's market value, I'm offering $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,900,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This price reflects the product's worth while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident this offer is fair and mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. I believe this offer provides a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is making larger concessions, he is still far below the product's value to me and my guaranteed sale price with John. I'll counteroffer one more time, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't significantly increase his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to see a more significant jump to make this worthwhile for both of us.  My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a firm price considering its value and the other offers I'm entertaining."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still outside my financial constraints.  I'm pushing my budget to the limit, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made it clear that $1,200,000 is his absolute limit.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my desired price. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is a substantial profit and avoids further risk or time spent negotiating."
