"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me. Given my own valuation and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This represents a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,650,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,500,000 is a significant offer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the full value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,575,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $1,575,000 is still a bit above my limit. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
