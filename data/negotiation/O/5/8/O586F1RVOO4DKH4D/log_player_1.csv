Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and express his interest. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while also leaving room for a back and forth negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter based on his response and my understanding of his perceived value of the product."
