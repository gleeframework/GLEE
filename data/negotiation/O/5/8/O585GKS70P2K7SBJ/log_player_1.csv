{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum value, but it gives you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  This strategy balances maximizing your profit while still being open to a deal with Bob.  We'll see what his response is and go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $10,000 is just a little too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but still protect my minimum value.  $11,000 is a good compromise and gives us both some room to maneuver. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I am still not able to go above $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its current condition and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $10,000, which is still below my minimum value.  While I'm open to negotiation,  it seems like further negotiation with Bob will be unproductive.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
