"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $10,000 is just a little too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I am still not able to go above $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its current condition and market value. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
