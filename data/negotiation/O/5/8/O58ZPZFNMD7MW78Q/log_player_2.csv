Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step down from her previous price, it's still above Bob's target. He can likely get a better deal with another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping to get it for even less, it's within his budget, and he's saved $1,200 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation is likely to lead to a stalemate, and accepting this offer will secure the product."
