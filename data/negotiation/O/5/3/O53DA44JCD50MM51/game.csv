"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $110.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $111, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $111. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $113. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",113.0,Alice,7,
