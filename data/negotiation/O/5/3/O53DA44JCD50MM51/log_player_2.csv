# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

While $112 is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still paying more than you'd like. It's worth seeing if you can push Alice down a bit further."

Alice is still holding out for a higher price. You've already pushed her down as much as you can, and you're getting close to your limit. It's better to buy from John and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
