"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a backup option with John, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his backup price of $1,000,000 with John, and it's reasonable considering Alice's minimum value for the product.  There's always a chance of getting it even lower, but the risk of further negotiations failing and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gain."
