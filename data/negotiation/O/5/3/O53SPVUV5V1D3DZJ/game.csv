"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $140. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to make the deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
