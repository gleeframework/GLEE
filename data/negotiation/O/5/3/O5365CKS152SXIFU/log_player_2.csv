"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. What do you think about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still get a good deal and save some money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
