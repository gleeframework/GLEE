Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than your fallback option of selling to John for $12,000.

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of him accepting and you maximize your potential profit."
