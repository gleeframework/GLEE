Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is unlikely to go below $125.  It's better to buy from John for $120 and avoid further haggling."
