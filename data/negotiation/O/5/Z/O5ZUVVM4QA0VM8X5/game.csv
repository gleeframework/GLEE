"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $9500. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and I hope it's within your range as well.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",10800.0,Bob,4,
