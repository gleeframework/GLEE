"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a negotiation process and try to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum price of $1,200,000 and allows him to save $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential of saving an additional $50,000."
