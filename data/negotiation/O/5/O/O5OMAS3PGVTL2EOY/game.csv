"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from your initial price, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce my price to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and is close to my maximum.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
