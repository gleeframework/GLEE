Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from your initial price, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but I'm still not comfortable at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and is close to my maximum.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
