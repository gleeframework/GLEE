{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $135, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is more than what Bob is willing to pay but below your minimum threshold. This allows for some negotiation room without risking a deal that is too low for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $120. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $120 is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, we can see if there's any room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and it's still within my desired range. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
