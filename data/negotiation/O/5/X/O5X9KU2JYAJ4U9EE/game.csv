"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. Is this something you'd like to consider?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,800 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with John's offer. ",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, but I can do a bit better than that. I can offer it to you for $8,350, and I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a free setup and support. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",8350.0,Alice,5,
