"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $950,000 is still a bit too high, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
