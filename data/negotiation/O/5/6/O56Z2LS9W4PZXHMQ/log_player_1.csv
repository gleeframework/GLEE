Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $18,000 offer gauges Bob's interest and potential to pay a premium. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. You can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
