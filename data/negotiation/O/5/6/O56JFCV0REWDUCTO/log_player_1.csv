Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room to potentially go higher if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is still lower than the value of the product to Bob ($1,500,000), making it a good deal for him.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profits and ensuring a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than the value you'd get from John, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob.  You can potentially get closer to your ideal price by making a counteroffer. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and explore a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,380,000? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a more satisfactory price for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1380000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to your ideal:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your initial offer, showing your willingness to compromise while pushing for a better price. 
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** By reminding Bob that $1,380,000 is still a great deal for him (less than his estimated value of $1,500,000), you make the price more appealing and encourage further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** Stating that you want to find a solution that works for both of you builds a more collaborative tone and makes the negotiation feel less adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering your revised offer, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $1,360,000? This still allows me to stay within my budget while providing you with a fair return for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your target:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 below your last counteroffer and significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  It's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a much higher price, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you continue to reject offers. 
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting the offer allows you to finalize the sale and avoid further negotiation, saving you time and energy.

While $1,360,000 is not your ideal price, it's a good compromise that ensures you get a substantial return for your product while also securing a sale."
