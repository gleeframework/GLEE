"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's starting offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). It's highly unlikely Alice will immediately drop to a price you're willing to accept.  A counteroffer is necessary to start negotiating towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While I recognize its value, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, signaling that you're serious about a lower price point. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $10,000 leaves room for negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, and you can slowly increase your offer towards your $8,000 limit.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message remains polite and respectful while clearly stating your position and desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant price reduction and I believe it represents a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has reduced her offer, $17,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and John's offer. It seems there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about a much lower price point and encourage her to make further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual:** This counteroffer represents a $5,000 decrease from Alice's previous offer, indicating you are willing to negotiate but still aiming for a much lower price. 
* **Maintaining Engagement:**  Continuing to engage with Alice keeps the negotiation alive, allowing you to gauge her flexibility and potentially secure a better price than John's $8,000 offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $12,000 counteroffer puts you in a stronger position for future rounds.  It leaves room to gradually increase your offer towards your $8,000 limit while still aiming for a price well below Alice's starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product while recognizing your budget considerations. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This offer stands as a final price point for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $14,500 is her final price. 
* **Too High:** Even with her final reduction, the price is still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Alice's firm stance suggests further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.

At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John at $8,000. While you might have gotten Alice to lower her price slightly, it's unlikely she would have gone down to a price that would make it worthwhile for you."
