"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to you, you can save $5 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice offered $75, which is $5 less than the product is worth to me.  I'm offering $70, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's still $10 less than the product's worth to me, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $71
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer saves me $9 compared to buying from John. With 7 rounds remaining, there's a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price without risking losing the opportunity entirely."
