"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,350,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still a bit away from a deal. Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,450,000. This compromise reflects the potential benefits you'll receive from owning it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this compromise?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below my desired price. Considering our ongoing dialogue and the unique value of this product, I'm willing to make a final concession and offer it for $1,400,000. This is a compromise that reflects the mutual benefit we can both achieve. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. This is my final and best offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
