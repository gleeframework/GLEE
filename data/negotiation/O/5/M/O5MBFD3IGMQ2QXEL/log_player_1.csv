I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's more than my minimum:** I'm guaranteed $80 from John, so this leaves some room for profit. 
* **It's not too high:** I don't want to scare Bob off with a price that's too high, especially since I don't know his perceived value.

Let's see if Bob is willing to pay this price!"
