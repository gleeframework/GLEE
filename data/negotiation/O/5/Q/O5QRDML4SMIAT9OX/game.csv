"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth $1,200,000 to you. I think you'll find it's still a great deal at this price!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll throw in a premium service package worth $20,000, which will make the total value of the deal $870,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",870000.0,Alice,5,
