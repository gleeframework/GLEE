"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise and move closer to Alice's price, but you're still holding firm to your goal of getting a better deal than what John is offering."
