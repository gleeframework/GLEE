Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to negotiate further. 

It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. However, I'm hoping to get as close to my target price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. This is still a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my target price and is a good deal considering the potential risks of further negotiation. I'd rather secure a deal now than risk further rejections and potentially have to settle for John's offer of $1,200,000."
