{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price.  You can potentially get a much better deal by counter-offering or even buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'm starting with the maximum I'm willing to pay. This counteroffer is the same price as John's offer, giving me a clear baseline for negotiation. If Alice rejects this, I know I can buy the product elsewhere."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. Although it is closer to my budget, there is still room for negotiation. I will reject her offer and continue to counter-offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, there's still potential to negotiate further.  I'll reject and counter-offer again, aiming to close the gap even more.  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by making a counteroffer closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price. My counteroffer is a compromise that should hopefully be attractive to Alice without compromising my financial goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my maximum budget.  Although I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll become unwilling to budge further or I might run the risk of her getting a better offer from another buyer. Accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision as it saves me time and ensures I get the product within my budget."
