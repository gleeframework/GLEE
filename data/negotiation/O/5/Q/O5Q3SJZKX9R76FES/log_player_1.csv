Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we settle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still not convinced the product is worth $13,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12,000. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll consider purchasing the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob.  Selling to John avoids further risk and potential wasted time in the negotiation."
