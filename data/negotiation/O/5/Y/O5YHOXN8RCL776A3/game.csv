"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that considers the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
