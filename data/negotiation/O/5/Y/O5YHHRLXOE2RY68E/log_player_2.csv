"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  $9,500 is close to your max, but you can likely get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's still worth negotiating with Alice.  $9,000 is closer to your budget but you can still try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to move closer to my price.  How about $8,900? I think this is a good compromise and will allow us to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $8,900 is within your budget and a decent price considering the product is worth $8,000 to her.  It's a good compromise and allows you to save some money compared to buying from John."
