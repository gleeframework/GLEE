Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I have a strong safety net.  My goal is to see if Bob will pay significantly more.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes the perceived value of the product.
* **Leave Room for John:** If Bob accepts the $18,000, I significantly increase my profit. If he rejects it, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or his willingness to pay beyond the $10,000 value it holds for him."
