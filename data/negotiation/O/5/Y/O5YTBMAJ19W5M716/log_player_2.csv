"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to us and its potential impact on your operations, I am extending an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  He's aiming for $800,000 or less, so rejecting the offer is the best course of action. It allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is very interesting, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  $750,000 is still above Bob's ideal price but allows room for a compromise in the next few rounds.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a professional and positive tone, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in our product, we need to maintain our minimum price for this item. We're willing to negotiate further, so I propose a counteroffer of $825,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point of $800,000.  While it's closer, Bob has room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially achieve his target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```
