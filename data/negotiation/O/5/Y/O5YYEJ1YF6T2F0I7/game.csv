"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go to $1400000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing me to acquire the product while still keeping within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1400000. Considering our previous negotiations, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1520000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $1520000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm willing to go to $1450000 as a final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to move forward with John's offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
