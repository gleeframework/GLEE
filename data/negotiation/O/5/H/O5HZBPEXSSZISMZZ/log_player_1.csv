Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $11,500 is still below Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential bargaining.
* **Is significantly higher than your minimum:** It provides a good profit margin for you, ensuring you're comfortable with the deal.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, but also provides you with the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
