"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item that's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is the best I can do for now.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $10,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to do $10,500 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $11,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.",11000.0,Alice,7,
