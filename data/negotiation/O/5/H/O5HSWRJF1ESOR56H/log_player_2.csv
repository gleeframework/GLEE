I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $11,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:** $11,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Alice is Firm:** Her language suggests she's serious about walking away if you push further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to negotiate a few hundred dollars more risks losing the deal entirely."
