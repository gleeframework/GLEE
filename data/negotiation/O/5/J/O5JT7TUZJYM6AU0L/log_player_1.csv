"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and the deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I anticipate Bob will likely make a counteroffer, and this price allows for some negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product. I can continue negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Potential to get a better price:**  I believe I can get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price.  How about $9,000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but staying well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a good deal for both of us.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, increasing his likelihood of accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $7,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there is still potential to get a higher price from Bob. I can continue negotiating by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:**  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I have the option to sell to John for a much better price, so there's no rush to accept an unfavorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $8,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My offer of $8,500 is a further compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Getting Closer:** This offer is getting closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000, which increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $8,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's previous offers, ensuring I maintain a decent profit. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us."
