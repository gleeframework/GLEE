Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could still settle on a price higher than $150.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the framing of the message focuses on value and a ""special offer"" rather than a hard bargain. 
 
This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still keeping the guaranteed sale to John as a safety net."
