"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, hoping to encourage acceptance.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Is that something we could work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept, I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me a fair profit while recognizing your interest in the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'm thinking $1200000 is a fair price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is now at the same price as John's offer.  It's a risky move to continue negotiating.  The chances of Bob accepting a higher offer are slim, and I risk losing time and ultimately settling for the same amount. 

I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and move on."
