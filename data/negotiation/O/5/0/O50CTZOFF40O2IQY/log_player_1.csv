{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd like to earn as much as possible, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counter his offer to try and reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  This would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've already countered twice, and it seems unlikely he'll go higher.  To guarantee I make at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $150."
