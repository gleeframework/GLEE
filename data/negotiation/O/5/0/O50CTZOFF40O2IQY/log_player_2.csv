"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than to you, so there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  This would still be a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target of $100. You can continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
