"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that favors you. This provides room for potential concessions and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The initial offer of $1,100,000 is below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but comfortably above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that you're willing to find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both your initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you're willing to negotiate further but not at the expense of a substantial profit. You're aiming to guide Bob closer to a price point that's more favorable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you proposed doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To move forward, I'd be willing to agree on a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by lowering the price from the initial $1,100,000. However, the decrease is modest, and the message emphasizes the product's value to justify the price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,050,000 price still keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price while aiming to nudge Bob towards a higher end of the negotiation range.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** A firm but reasonable counteroffer keeps the negotiation dynamic and encourages Bob to re-evaluate his position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong compromise and a significant profit for you. Here's why:

* **Exceeds Your Minimum:** It's $200,000 above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Midpoint:** It sits comfortably between your initial asking price and Bob's first offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate. Accepting now secures a substantial profit. 

While there might be a chance to extract a bit more from Bob, the certainty of closing the deal at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in later rounds."
