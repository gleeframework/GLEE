**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently moved closer to my price point, and her latest offer of $1,062,500 is a reasonable compromise. While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of her walking away from the deal. It's better to secure the product at a good price now than risk missing out entirely."
