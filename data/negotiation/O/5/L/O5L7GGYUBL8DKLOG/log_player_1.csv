"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get a good deal. However, I'm not going too high, as I don't want to risk him immediately rejecting the offer and potentially going to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a price that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price close to my minimum. I believe this counteroffer is a good middle ground that might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer than before. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price. There are still rounds left and I don't want to rush into selling to John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, showing that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob. This offer is still above my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I feel there's still room for negotiation with Bob and the potential to close a deal at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to my absolute minimum. I'm confident Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm hoping he'll accept this final offer. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing more time and potential profit."
