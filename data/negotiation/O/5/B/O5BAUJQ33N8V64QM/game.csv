"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest at a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,000,000 is more in line with my budget, I'm aiming for a final price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
