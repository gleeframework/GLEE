"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit beyond my budget.  Perhaps we could agree on $700,000? This would represent a significant saving for me while still giving you a good return.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  This would be my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,7,
