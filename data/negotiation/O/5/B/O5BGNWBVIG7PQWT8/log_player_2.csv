Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $850,000. You've reached your upper limit, and further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful. You can get the product from John for $800,000, meeting your needs without further haggling."
