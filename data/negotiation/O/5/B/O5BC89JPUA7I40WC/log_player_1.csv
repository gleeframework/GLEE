Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily coming closer to our desired price, but we're not in a desperate situation yet. We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering.  $1,110,000 is my final offer. It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll see significant returns on this investment."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to start applying pressure and setting a firmer stance. We've come down in price, but this offer is still strong and gives Bob a chance to close the deal at a price favorable to both parties.  The ""final offer"" statement adds weight to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to crunch time. Bob is now getting close to John's offer. We need to signal we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible, but I need to be upfront.  I have another buyer interested at a lower price. I'm willing to make this deal work, but $1,100,000 is absolutely my bottom line. This is your last chance to acquire this product before I move on."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to lay all the cards on the table.  We're giving a final offer, but also introducing a sense of urgency and the possibility of another buyer. This puts the decision squarely in Bob's hands while still keeping a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not willing to meet your original price. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer at this point. He's testing our resolve.  It's not worth risking losing $75,000 (the difference between his offer and John's) in further haggling.  We've negotiated well, but it's time to secure a sure win."
