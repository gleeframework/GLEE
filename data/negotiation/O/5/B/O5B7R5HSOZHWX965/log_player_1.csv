I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also hoping to get closer to my desired price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $14,000,  which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still too low for me.  It's better to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
