"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer at $110. This is still a fair price for both of us. It's a compromise that gives Bob a better price than my initial offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105. It's a good price considering my minimum acceptable price was $100, and it saves me from the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a worse outcome."
