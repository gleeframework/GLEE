"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above Bob's value of $80, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate while ensuring I don't lose out on a potentially better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $95? I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92. While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good deal considering Bob's budget limitations and the fact that I'm running out of time to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of losing out on a deal altogether."
