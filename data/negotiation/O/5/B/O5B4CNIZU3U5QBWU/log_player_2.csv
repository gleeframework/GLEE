"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before reaching your $10,000 maximum or even getting closer to Alice's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?"", 
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but still comfortably above her perceived value of $8,000.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By suggesting a price ""in the middle,"" the tone remains amicable and suggests a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,250 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved down from her initial offer, $9,000 is still significantly higher than both her value and your ideal price.
* **Concessions Encourage Negotiation:** By continuing to reject offers that are too high, you signal that you're serious about getting a good deal and encourage Alice to make further concessions. 
* **Alternative is Secure:** You still have the option to buy from John for $10,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the product entirely if negotiations with Alice stall."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $8,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  This counteroffer moves up slightly from your previous offer ($8,250), showing willingness to compromise but also maintaining a firm stance on getting a good price.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  This offer aims for a price point roughly between your last offer and Alice's most recent offer, seeking a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While the tone is still polite, the suggestion of a ""fair compromise"" subtly puts the onus on Alice to accept or present a more compelling counter-offer."
