"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $87.50, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be. How about $86?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $86, Bob. I can do $88, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle",88.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still just a little over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $89, but I have to say, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet at a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can meet in the middle",89.0,Alice,7,
