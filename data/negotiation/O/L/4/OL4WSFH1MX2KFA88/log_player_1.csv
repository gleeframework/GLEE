"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good deal.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $170 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  Bob is showing interest and I want to see if I can push for closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $180 is a good compromise, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  It's likely we won't get a significantly better offer from Bob, and accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
