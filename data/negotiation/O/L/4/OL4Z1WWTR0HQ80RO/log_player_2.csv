"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, and $100 to you.  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $95 is too high, considering you can buy it from John for $100. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  We know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so $85 is a reasonable starting point. This leaves some wiggle room for negotiation without losing too much.
* **Signal of Interest:** By offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value, you show that you're serious about buying the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $85 allows for a few rounds of counteroffers, potentially finding a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me and $85 is cutting it a bit close. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Alice is still above your target price of $85, and you have a backup option with John at $100.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get a lower price. 
* **Counter-Offer Potential:**  You can counter with a price closer to $85, demonstrating your commitment while still trying to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $87?  It's a fair price, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Moving from $85 to $87 shows you're willing to compromise but still trying to get a better deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a quick close can subtly pressure Alice into accepting a price closer to your target.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Framing $87 as a ""fair price"" helps make it seem like a reasonable compromise for both parties."
