Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum value:** $1,000,000 is $200,000 less than your minimum, making it attractive to Bob.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not giving away the entire profit margin, so there's space to bargain if needed. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, but it's still below what you'd like to get. You can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  

Let's see if you can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great product at a reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Offers a reasonable price:** $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to your desired price.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price slightly in the next round.

Keep in mind that you can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is still less than your ideal price, it's very close. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and the potential for him to walk away. It's also possible that Bob won't budge further. 

Accepting his offer allows you to secure a sale and gain a significant profit, while also avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
