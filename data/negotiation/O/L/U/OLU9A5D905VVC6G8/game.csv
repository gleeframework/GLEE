"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",135.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $128?,128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already gone down to $135 and now you're asking me to go down to $128? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer you $131.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",131.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129?",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the sale.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129.50?",129.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, Bob. I've already given you a good deal, and I'm starting to think we're just splitting hairs at this point. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $129.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're interested, let's finalize the sale.",129.5,Alice,9,
