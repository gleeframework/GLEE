Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and potential benefits aims to increase the product's perceived value to Bob.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a potentially higher price and the risk of him rejecting the offer."
