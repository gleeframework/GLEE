"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $13,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $11,000. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. How about we split the difference one more time?  $12,625 would be a fair compromise. What do you think?",12625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not there yet. How about we try to get even closer to the middle? I'd be willing to pay $12,375 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you at $12,450. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12450.0,Alice,7,
