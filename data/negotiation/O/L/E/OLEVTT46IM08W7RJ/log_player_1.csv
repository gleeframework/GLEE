Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still staying above your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If he's a tough negotiator, he might counter-offer or walk away. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still ensuring a sale."
