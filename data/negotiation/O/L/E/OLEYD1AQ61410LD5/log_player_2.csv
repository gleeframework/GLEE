"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $108. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $108, which is still within my budget of $120 and a better deal than John's offer.  I'll accept her offer."
