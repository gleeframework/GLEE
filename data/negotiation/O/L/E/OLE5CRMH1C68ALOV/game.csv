"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see its true value once you start using it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you consider $12,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you seem really interested in this product and I want to make a deal happen.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13500.0,Bob,6,
