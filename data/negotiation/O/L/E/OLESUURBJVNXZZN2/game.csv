"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is a good price, I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you consider dropping the price to $10,500? I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
