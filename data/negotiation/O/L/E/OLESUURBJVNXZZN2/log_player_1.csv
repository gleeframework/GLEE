Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for some wiggle room for negotiation, and I can potentially lower the price if Bob counteroffers.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing finding a price that works for both of us to build a positive negotiating atmosphere. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage and prevents me from settling for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is a good price, I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you consider dropping the price to $10,500? I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.
* **I have a backup buyer.** John is willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **There's room for a counteroffer.**  Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power and can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility while protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob of getting the product for less than its value to him. This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Open for discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going and encourage further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and can walk away if necessary."
