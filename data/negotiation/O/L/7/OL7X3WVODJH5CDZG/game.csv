"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $800000 is a bit too steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600000, considering my budget and the potential for negotiation. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers and pay $650000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount from my previous offer and sell the product to you for $675000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I understand the product's value, $675000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $660000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal with a final offer.",660000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $660000. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment from my previous offer and sell the product to you for $680000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.
