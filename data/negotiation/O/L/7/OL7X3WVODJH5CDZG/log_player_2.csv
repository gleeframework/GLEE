"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $800,000 is a bit too steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600,000, considering my budget and the potential for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still well within my budget. This signals my interest in the product while leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping to push Alice towards a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to $600,000.  There's still potential for a better deal without rushing into an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers and pay $650,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offers.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get the best possible price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice and lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount from my previous offer and sell the product to you for $675000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hesitant to accept it. There are a few rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price.  I'm hoping to reach a deal at or below $650,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I understand the product's value, $675,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $660,000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal with a final offer."", ""product_price"": 660000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to get closer to my initial goal of $650,000. This counteroffer offers a slight increase, but I'm framing it as a ""final offer"" to incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $660000. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment from my previous offer and sell the product to you for $680000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation and Alice is not budging much. At this point, with only 3 rounds left, the risk of not closing the deal with Alice outweighs the potential of saving a few thousand more dollars.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed option from John."
