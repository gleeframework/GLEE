Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a decent profit margin, but it's also a price point that Bob might consider reasonable. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better to secure the sale at $80 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same price."
