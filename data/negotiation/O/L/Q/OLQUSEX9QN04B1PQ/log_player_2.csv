"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's far above your target price. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $950,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this figure."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product.  How about we settle on $900,000? It's a compromise on both our ends, and allows us to move forward with this deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still higher than your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate one last time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can close this deal for $875,000. This price is reasonable given our respective needs, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to accept $925,000. This shows a real commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to your target, you've only got 3 rounds left.  It's getting risky to continue negotiating with Alice. It's a safer bet to go with John's offer and secure the product for your budget."
