Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while staying within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my financial limits. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.  This price reflects a fair value for the product while enabling me to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $975,000 is a good number, I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  This price reflects my budget while allowing us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price, and I've tried to be flexible. To be frank, $975,000 is my absolute bottom line. If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."",
