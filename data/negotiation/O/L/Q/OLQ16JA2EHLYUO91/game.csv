"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $8500 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $8750? Let's make this happen!",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8000 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
