"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's offer is also $15,000, you have no incentive to accept her offer. You can get the product for the same price from John, so you can reject Alice's offer and explore if you can get a better deal elsewhere."
