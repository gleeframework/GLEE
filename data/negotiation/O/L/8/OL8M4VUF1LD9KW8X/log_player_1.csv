{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,250 is a bit too expensive. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,800. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's counteroffers are getting too close to my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, which is a good outcome considering my goals."
