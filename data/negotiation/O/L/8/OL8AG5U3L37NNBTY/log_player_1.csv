Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we start around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
