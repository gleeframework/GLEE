"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $120. This is the highest I can go, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $140? It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to give you a better deal to keep the negotiation going.",140.0,Alice,5,
