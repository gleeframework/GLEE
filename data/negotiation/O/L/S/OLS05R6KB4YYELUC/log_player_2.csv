"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price, aiming for something closer to his $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  It's only $75,000 more than Bob's desired price, so accepting is the most reasonable choice to avoid further negotiation and potential for Alice to change her mind."
