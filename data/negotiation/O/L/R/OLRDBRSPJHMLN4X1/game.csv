"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to keep your spending within a budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can offer you a compromise at $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to find some common ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I can offer you a slight discount at $11250, but I'm not budging below that. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
