You can do better than $95.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm offering $85, which is still a good deal for Alice as it's more than what she values the product at. It's also a reasonable price for me as it's below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

$90 is still too high. I'll try to get a better price with another counteroffer."

``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to $88, which is still a good deal for Alice.  It's a compromise and may be more appealing than our previous offer.  It's also close to my target price, so I'm getting closer to a good deal."
