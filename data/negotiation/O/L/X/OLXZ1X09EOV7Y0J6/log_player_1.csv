Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $99. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below the $100 you're guaranteed from John. This price point makes it more tempting for Bob, as it seems like a ""deal"" compared to your alternative.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
