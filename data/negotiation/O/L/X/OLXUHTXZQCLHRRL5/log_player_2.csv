"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $2000000, but I'm open to discussing this further.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1400000 is significantly less than my initial ask, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1700000.  This reflects the value of the product to me and hopefully makes it more appealing to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
