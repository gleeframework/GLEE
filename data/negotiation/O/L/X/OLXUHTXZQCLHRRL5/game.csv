"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $2000000, but I'm open to discussing this further.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1400000 is significantly less than my initial ask, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1700000.  This reflects the value of the product to me and hopefully makes it more appealing to you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000. Can you consider this offer?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
