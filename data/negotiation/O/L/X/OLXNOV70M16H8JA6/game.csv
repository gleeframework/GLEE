"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your price point. While $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1150000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1150000 is still slightly below my target price, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1175000.
