"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to make a deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9750. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $11250. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find common ground.  However, $11250 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $10250 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",10250.0,Bob,6,
