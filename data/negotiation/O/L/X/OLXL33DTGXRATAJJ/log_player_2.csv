"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $13,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to set the tone for negotiation. He suggests a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above his absolute maximum. 
* **Message:**  Bob conveys interest in the product while justifying his counteroffer by highlighting the price as a factor. He also expresses optimism about reaching a compromise. 
* **Strategy:**  This approach attempts to  establish a lower starting point for negotiation and encourages Alice to move closer to Bob's desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $11,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's counteroffer of $12,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from John:**  Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  
* **Negotiation:** While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. It's possible Bob could get a better deal by continuing the negotiations. 

By rejecting Alice's offer and continuing the negotiation, Bob maintains the possibility of getting the product for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,250 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This would allow me to purchase the product within my budget and ensure a successful deal for both of us. I'm sure we can finalize this transaction with a price that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob is now offering Alice his maximum price. This makes it clear that he's serious about making a deal.
* **Message:**  Bob continues to express interest in the product while emphasizing the need to stay within his budget. The message also hints at a sense of urgency, suggesting a final offer.
* **Strategy:** This approach puts pressure on Alice to accept the offer. If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob has the option to buy from John, ending the negotiation."
