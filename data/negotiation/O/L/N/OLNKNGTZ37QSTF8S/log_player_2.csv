"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $150. Considering its value to you, would you be interested in purchasing it for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget of $120.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than the initial asking price. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we agree on a price of $135 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $135 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to his desired price of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to compromise, I propose a price of $132 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer and reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made significant concessions and is now very close to his maximum budget. Alice is only willing to go down to $132, which is still above Bob's limit.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation for a small price reduction, especially with the risk that Alice might increase the price again.  At this point, buying from John for $120 is the best option to ensure he gets the product while staying within his budget."
