"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset for you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to land a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to get the negotiations moving in the right direction while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is simply too low. I'm prepared to accept $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from the initial offer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to compromise, and Bob may end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
