Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price seems a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and moving towards our desired price point. Let's counter and see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 6

You have three options:

While we could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly motivated and we are already well above our minimum. Accepting at $1,190,000 secures a great profit without risking the deal by pushing too hard."
