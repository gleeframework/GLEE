"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

This offer is way above your limit. It's a good time to start negotiating down towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer gauges Alice's flexibility. Her response will tell us if she's open to a deal or if we need to move closer to our limit. 
* **John as Backup:** We always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $100, so we don't want to settle for a price too close to that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice came down slightly, but it's still too high. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price but also signal some willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to our limit but showing Alice we're willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering a price almost exactly in the middle of our previous offers can signal a desire to settle. 
* **Pressure:** By increasing our offer, we're putting a bit more pressure on Alice to lower hers significantly or risk losing the sale."
