"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is too low.  Even though I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, but I'm hoping this offer will be agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting a lower offer in the next round.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure a reasonable profit."
