"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm willing to offer $15000, which is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
