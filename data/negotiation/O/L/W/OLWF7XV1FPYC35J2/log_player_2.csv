"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation but lower than what you're willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation. It's more beneficial to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $925,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $850,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $890,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $890,000 is still higher than her own valuation but significantly lower than what you're willing to pay.  This is a good deal for you, saving you $110,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best strategy in this round."
