{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] and I believe it would be a fantastic asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a brief description of the product to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a good price, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of him rejecting further offers is high. It's more secure to sell the product to John for my minimum value, ensuring a guaranteed sale."
