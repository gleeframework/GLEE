Round 4

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is negotiating. While his offer is getting closer to our backup of $1,000,000, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this gap.  How about $1,100,000 even?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** We're making a smaller concession this round, signaling that we're reaching our limit, but still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Clear communication:**  By stating ""final offer"" we're adding a sense of urgency and giving Bob a chance to seriously consider before we walk away. 
* **Favorable outcome likely:**  This price is still a significant gain for us over our backup offer from John.  Bob's previous offers indicate he's very likely to accept something in this range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  We've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely. Bob is firm at $1,090,000, and pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Solid Profit:**  $1,090,000 is still a very good deal, exceeding our backup offer from John by a significant margin. 
* **Finality:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer. We've negotiated well, but it's unlikely he'll budge further. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of him finding an alternative solution."
