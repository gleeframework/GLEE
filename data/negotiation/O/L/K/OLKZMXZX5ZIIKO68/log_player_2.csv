"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, so accepting it is the best option. You get the product and save no money compared to buying from John, but you also don't risk losing the opportunity if Alice changes her mind."
