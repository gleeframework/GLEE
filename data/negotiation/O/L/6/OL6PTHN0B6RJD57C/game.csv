"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and allows me a fair return on my investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant difference from my initial price. I'm willing to accept $1,325,000. This is a compromise that allows me to recoup a fair value while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know if this works for you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
