Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while aiming for a strong profit.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""initially offering,"" I signal  willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a deal, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the significant benefits it offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Explanation:** I'm politely rejecting Bob's offer, providing a clear reason for my decision (the price doesn't reflect the value).
* **Significant Concession, but within limits:**  I'm making a substantial concession to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage. However, I'm still aiming for a price well above his initial offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value, hoping to shift Bob's focus away from just the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price I find acceptable. His offer of $950,000 is still substantially below my $1,200,000 minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap quickly enough to justify continuing with Bob. I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
