"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I can't go higher than $8000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to get it for $8500.  What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $9000? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $8750.  That's my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $8800, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",8800.0,Alice,7,
