Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Even though I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear he's not willing to pay what the product is worth to me.  John is offering a guaranteed price that's closer to my valuation, so it's the best decision for me."
