"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is lower than the price you'd pay John ($100).
* **Your goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for less. 
* **Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, that's not relevant to your decision.** Your focus is on getting the best price for yourself, not on what the seller values the product at."
