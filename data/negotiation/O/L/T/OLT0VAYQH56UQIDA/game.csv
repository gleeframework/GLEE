,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly less than what I can let it go for. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems we are getting closer. I could be willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate that offer, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,6,
