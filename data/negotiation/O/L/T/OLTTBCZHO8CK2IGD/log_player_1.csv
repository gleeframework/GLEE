Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be a great fit. I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed sale price of $15,000 from John, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.  
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A high initial offer gives you space to potentially negotiate down if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial price. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  This offer will help you understand how much Bob values the product and his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can always come down significantly or proceed with John. 

By starting high, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from either Bob or John."
