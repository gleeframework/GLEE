"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a better option with John, who is selling the product for $1,000,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to find an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but it's still above what you're willing to pay. You can likely negotiate a lower price, considering John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal and move forward. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While you can still try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to your desired price point.  Considering John's offer of $1,000,000, it's not a huge jump in price and offers a good compromise.  You might not get a lower price from Alice, and it's worth accepting the offer and securing the product."
