Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $13,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $2,000, making it an attractive deal for him.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of selling to John for $8,000 if Bob declines, so you can afford to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances your goal of maximizing profit while still offering Bob a price that encourages him to accept."
