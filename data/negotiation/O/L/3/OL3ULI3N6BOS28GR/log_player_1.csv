Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a highly competitive price of $750,000. I believe it offers significant value for your needs, even exceeding its current price point in the market. I'm confident you'll find this offer highly advantageous."", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** To incentivize Bob and maximize profit, Alice should offer the product slightly below Bob's valuation. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $750,000 leaves room for potential negotiation upward while still ensuring a significant profit margin for Alice. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to secure a sale with Bob quickly. While Alice has a guaranteed offer from John, selling to Bob first eliminates potential delays and secures immediate profit."
