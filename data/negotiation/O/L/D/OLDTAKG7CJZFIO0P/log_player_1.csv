"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but still below what I believe the product is worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to build interest.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $140 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since Bob has expressed interest.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have John's offer as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $155?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price in between his last offer and my minimum.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:** I'm reminding him that $155 is still a good deal compared to his initial estimate of $120.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm using language like ""willing to be flexible"" to signal openness to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $155 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $145. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 threshold.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  We've made progress. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm finally offering my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us to encourage acceptance.
* **Reiterate product value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the deal's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $142. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation at a standstill:** Bob's offer of $142 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price. 
* **Risk of losing time:** I've already reached the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk of Bob continuing to lower his offers or not reaching a deal.
* **John's offer provides certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
