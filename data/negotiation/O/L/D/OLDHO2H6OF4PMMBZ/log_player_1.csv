Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Testing the waters:**  The $18,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This helps gauge his eagerness and potential to go above his initial valuation.
* **Confident but not greedy:**  While aiming high, the message avoids sounding overly aggressive or dismissive. It emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's perspective. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your fallback is selling to John at $10,000, so any amount you can get above that is a win."
