# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is cheaper than Alice's offer of $12,500. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $500."
