"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant margin above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me to make it seem more valuable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message shows I'm open to discussing the price. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he's shown interest in the product. 
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob. 

I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant price reduction, and it's the best I can do. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $9,500 shows I'm willing to compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's value.
* **Emphasize Value:** I highlight the ""significant price reduction"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Finality:** The message subtly hints that this is my best offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

Let's see if this counteroffer is good enough for Bob!"
