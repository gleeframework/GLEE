"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $700,000. How about we try $825,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $800,000 is the very top of my budget. If you're able to do that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your absolute maximum, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $850,000? It's a bit more than your top offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
