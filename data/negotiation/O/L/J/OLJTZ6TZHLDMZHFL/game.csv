"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be workable for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering what you're getting.",12000.0,Alice,5,
