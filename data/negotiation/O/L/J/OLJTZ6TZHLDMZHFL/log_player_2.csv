Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:**  She's clearly stated that $12,000 is her lowest price. 
* **You're getting a good deal:**  You're buying the product for $3,000 less than John's offer and at a price you find acceptable.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Pushing further could frustrate Alice and risk the deal entirely. 

Accepting now secures you a good price and avoids potential complications."
