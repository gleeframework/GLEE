"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $850,000, but I'm only comfortable paying $780,000 right now. It's still a great deal for you, as it's very close to your value. Let me know what you think!",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $780,000 is a good offer, it's just a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $820,000. This reflects the value we both recognize, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $820,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to offer $805,000, which is a fair price considering our respective valuations. I believe this is a good middle ground and a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal!",805000.0,Bob,4,
