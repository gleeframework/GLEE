"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I value at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While the product is worth $150 to Bob, Alice is offering it for $120, saving Bob $30.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that."
