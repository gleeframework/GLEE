```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair and competitive price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and has a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of your product, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 floor. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still out of my reach. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900000. This is a fair price, and it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has remained firm on his offer of $900,000, which is still below my minimum of $1,200,000.  With only four rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal with Bob. It's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $1,200,000 to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
