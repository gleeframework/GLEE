"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a valuable item, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair and competitive price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and has a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still out of my reach. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900000. This is a fair price, and it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
