"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a very fair price for a product of this quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is close, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  That's my final offer.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
