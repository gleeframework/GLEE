"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's best to reject and counteroffer to start a negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,950,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,950,000 is still above my budget of $1,500,000.  While it's closer than her initial offer, I'll reject and continue to negotiate for a lower price."
