Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we need to bridge this gap. Your offer is generous, but the product's intrinsic value is significantly higher.  To be candid, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this would be a valuable asset for you. My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has consistently overvalued the product and is unlikely to come down to a price that's acceptable to you. Her mention of another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 and saving yourself further negotiation hassle."
