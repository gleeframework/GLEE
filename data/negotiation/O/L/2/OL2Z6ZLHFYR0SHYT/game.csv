"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? This price still leaves you a significant profit margin and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
