"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John ($1,000,000). Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to move forward and secure the best possible price."
