"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I expected. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's aim for a quick agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
