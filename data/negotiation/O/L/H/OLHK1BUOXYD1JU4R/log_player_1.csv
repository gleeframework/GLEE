Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's aim for a quick agreement.
