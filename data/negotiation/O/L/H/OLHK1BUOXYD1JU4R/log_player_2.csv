"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a significant asset. My initial price is $950,000.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's value of $800,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also makes a clear statement that he wants a better price. The message is friendly and open to further discussion, encouraging Alice to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I expected. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's aim for a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is now very close to Bob's counteroffer of $875,000. It's a good deal for Bob, as he's saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's also a reasonable price for Alice, allowing her to make a decent profit.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
