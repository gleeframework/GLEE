{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum of $150, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
