,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",155.0,Bob,4,
