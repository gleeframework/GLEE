"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds for you will quickly justify the price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, so it's likely worth more than $1,200,000 to me. I can get it for $1,000,000 from John, which is a better deal.
