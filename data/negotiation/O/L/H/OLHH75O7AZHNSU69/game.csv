,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm still evaluating the product's value. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable compromise while acknowledging the product's potential worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
