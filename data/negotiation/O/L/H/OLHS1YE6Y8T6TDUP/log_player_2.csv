"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would significantly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  This gives you the opportunity to push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I'm looking for.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate on both our parts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your desired price.** While it's a step in the right direction, you still have room to negotiate and save more money.
* **Continuing to counteroffer gives you a better chance at a lower price.**  You can try to meet somewhere in the middle, but be firm on your desire for a price closer to your initial counteroffer."
