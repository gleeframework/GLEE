"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would significantly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I'm looking for.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate on both our parts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
