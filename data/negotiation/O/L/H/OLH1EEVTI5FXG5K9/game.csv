"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will help you achieve your goals. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. I know you're a shrewd businessman, so I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
