"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($150). This gives me room to negotiate down and still get a good deal.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a really good deal, let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to get a price that is closer to my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and trying to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $120?  I'm really interested in this product, let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $125.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum of $150, Bob has come up to $125 and I only have a few rounds left. I'm going to accept his offer and avoid the risk of getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $150."
