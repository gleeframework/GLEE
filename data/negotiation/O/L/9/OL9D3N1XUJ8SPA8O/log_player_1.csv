Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off by the price, you know he's highly price-sensitive and you can adjust your approach if needed."
