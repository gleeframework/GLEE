"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount of money, it's far below the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  I'm confident that I can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired value. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm willing to explore getting a better price from Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can potentially push for a slightly higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 just yet, especially since we're getting close to a potentially more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions we've both made.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1075000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly what I would get by selling to John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as he is unlikely to go higher, and I risk losing time and the chance to close the deal.  Accepting Bob's offer secures the desired price and allows me to move on."
