"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions we've both made.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1075000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
