"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
