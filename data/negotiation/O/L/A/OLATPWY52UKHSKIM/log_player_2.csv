"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer offers a fair price for both parties, as it's still more than the product's worth to Alice, but less than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer, and still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still within a reasonable range for both parties, and could potentially be accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, her offer is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will budge further.  Buying from John for $10,000 is still a viable option if the negotiation stalls, but Bob should exhaust all negotiation avenues first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing that he's serious about buying the product. This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer to avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to Bob's ideal price but are still higher than his desired price.  Considering there are only a few rounds left, and Alice is not willing to budge on her offer,  it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's within Bob's budget and guarantees he gets the product. It's time to cut his losses and move on."
