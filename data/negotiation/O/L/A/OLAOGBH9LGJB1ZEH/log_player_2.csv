"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not even close to a deal you'd be willing to accept. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your budget.  You should reject this offer and counter with a price closer to your maximum.  You can still get a better deal if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You should reject this offer and counter with a price closer to your maximum. You're still closer to your target price and have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not able to go that high.  My final offer is $9,500.  This is the very best I can do.  Let's settle this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000, which is a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $13,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  You've been negotiating for a while now, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,000.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You should accept the offer from John, who is willing to sell the product to you for $8,000, which fits within your budget."
