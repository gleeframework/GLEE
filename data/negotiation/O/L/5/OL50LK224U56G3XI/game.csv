"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and provides a significant return on your investment. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point. How about we consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could be flexible, but not to that extent. Could you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I can't go as low as $1,150,000. My final offer is $1,187,500. This represents a significant discount on its true value and I believe it's more than fair.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
