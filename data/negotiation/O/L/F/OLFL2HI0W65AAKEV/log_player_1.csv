Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This gives me a good margin over my minimum price of $150, but it's not so high that it's likely to be rejected out of hand. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $150, so I have nothing to lose by trying for a higher price."
