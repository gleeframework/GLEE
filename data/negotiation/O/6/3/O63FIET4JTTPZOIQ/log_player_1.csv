{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $150 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and if not, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $120? That's a fair compromise, and it would give us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $115. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. Accepting this offer ensures a sale, even though it's not my ideal price."
