Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my counteroffer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, but I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale at the same price, and I don't want to risk losing any more time."
