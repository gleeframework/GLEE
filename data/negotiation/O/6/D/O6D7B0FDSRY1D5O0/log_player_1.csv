{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then slightly reduce the price while still remaining well above her minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $14,999 feels significantly cheaper than $15,000, potentially making Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice has a strong fallback option with John. This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while minimizing potential losses."
