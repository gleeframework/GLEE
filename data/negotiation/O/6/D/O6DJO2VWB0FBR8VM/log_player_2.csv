Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. It's worth considerably more than that to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?
