Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned is over $1000000 to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better price. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a higher price that reflects the product's true value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

It's worth considerably more than that to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced that it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can come to an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
