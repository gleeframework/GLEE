# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500.

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,050. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** You're only willing to pay $10,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has made concessions, and there's a good chance she'll come down a little more to close the deal.

It's worth pushing for a lower price. You're close to your goal and Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,875.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** You're only willing to pay $10,000.
* **You've reached a point of diminishing returns.**  You've been negotiating for several rounds and Alice seems to be unwilling to budge much further. 
* **Option 3 is your best choice now.**  Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's better to end the negotiation with Alice and save the hassle and potential risk of continuing. 

It's better to secure the product at your target price rather than risking that Alice will counteroffer again, potentially pushing the price even higher."
