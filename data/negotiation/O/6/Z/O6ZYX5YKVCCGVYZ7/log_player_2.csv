Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000.

""message"": ""Alice, this negotiation has gone back and forth quite a bit, and we're getting close to the wire.  To prevent this from going any further, I'd be willing to meet you at $740,000. This is my final offer; otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."",

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your urgency, but I'm not willing to accept $740,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice didn't meet our ideal price, her final offer of $795,000 is a reasonable compromise. We've reached a point where squeezing further concessions is unlikely. Accepting this offer secures a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
