"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($15,000) but lower than what it's worth to Bob ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion. I want to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want and even lower than the value of the product to him.  While I want to close a deal, accepting this offer would be a major loss. I need to keep negotiating to try and get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I'm also reiterating my desire to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  To be honest, my absolute top end is $11,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'll take it right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I know that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try to secure a better price in the next round or ultimately sell to John if no agreement can be reached with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and is a good deal for me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is the minimum value the product holds for Bob. This shows a significant willingness to compromise and  might convince him to accept. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message concise and directly addressing Bob's previous statement about his budget.  I'm also highlighting the fairness of the offer,  hoping to appeal to his sense of reason and encourage a deal."
