"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell the product to you for $16,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really pushing the limits of my budget at $15,000, and that's the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,
