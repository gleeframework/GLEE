"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price between $150 and $200, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $175? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm sticking to my original offer of $80.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is still a bit low for me, but I don't want to lose the sale. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $120, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,5,
