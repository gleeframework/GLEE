Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price between $150 and $200, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $175? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

While $175 is better than $200, it's still too high for your budget. You'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $175 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm sticking to my original offer of $80.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is still a bit low for me, but I don't want to lose the sale. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $120, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

While $120 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more than what you're willing to pay.  Since you can get the product from John for $80, that's the best option."
