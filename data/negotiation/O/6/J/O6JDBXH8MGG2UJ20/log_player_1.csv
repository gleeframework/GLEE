Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80), but that's okay.  The goal is to see if he's willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth.
* **Below John's Offer:** The offer is still lower than what John is willing to pay ($150), ensuring a profit regardless of Bob's decision. 

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice earns more than her minimum.
2. **Secure a Sale Quickly:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John."
