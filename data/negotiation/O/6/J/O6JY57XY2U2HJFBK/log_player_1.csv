"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering the product for $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, highlighting the opportunity and value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation process alive. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while still being open to a deal. I'm also aware of my fallback option with John, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to make a deal with Bob, accepting his offer would result in a huge financial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I still want to explore a deal with Bob, but I need to ensure I'm not sacrificing too much profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the value of the product and offers you a fair opportunity to acquire it. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but counter with a price that's closer to his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Collaboration:** I use language like ""work together"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to create a positive and cooperative tone.

**Strategy:**

By offering $1,000,000, I'm testing the waters. If Bob is truly interested, this price should be attractive to him while still allowing me to profit. If he rejects again, I'll need to re-evaluate my options, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John."
