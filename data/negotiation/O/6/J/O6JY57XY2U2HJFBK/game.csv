"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the value of the product and offers you a fair opportunity to acquire it. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
