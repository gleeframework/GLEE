"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum, but still gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and my willingness to be flexible.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm confident that I can make a profit even if Bob counters, as long as he doesn't go too low.
* **Option to sell to John:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to be assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think $100 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, and there's still a chance I can reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $150, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $115 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm sticking to a price above my minimum, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a ""meeting in the middle"" creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider my offer.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** $115 is still well above my $150 minimum, ensuring I make a profit and avoid a ""bad deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your offer and am willing to pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $110 is only $5 below my ideal price of $115. While I'd love to get closer, I'm confident that accepting this offer is a good decision.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we're nearing the midpoint of the negotiations, I don't want to risk losing too much time. Accepting this offer allows me to move on and secure a profit.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could try to get a few more dollars, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, and I'll end up with nothing. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a good profit."
