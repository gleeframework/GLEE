"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident this price will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price would still allow you a significant profit and would be a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is a significant increase from your initial offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still allow you a substantial profit and represent a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
