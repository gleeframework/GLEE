"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value and my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off from that number. Could we do $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm selling. $1,175,000 is just too low. I could be persuaded to accept $1,220,000.  This is my final offer.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
