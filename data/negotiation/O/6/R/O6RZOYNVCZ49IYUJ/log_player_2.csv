"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its high value and the fact that it's worth $15,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its quality and your expectations. Considering the market value and the importance of this product to you, I suggest we aim for a price around $14,000. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring you receive the best possible deal. Let's schedule a call to further discuss and finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value of $15,000.  You're better off rejecting the offer and going with John. You can then negotiate with John to see if you can lower the price further."
