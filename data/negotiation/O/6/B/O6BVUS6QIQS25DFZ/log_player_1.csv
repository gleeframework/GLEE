Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell, so you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000, you're subtly anchoring Bob's perception of its value. This makes your asking price of $12,000 seem more reasonable. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can always negotiate down or proceed with selling to John, ensuring you get at least your minimum price."
