"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the discount, $800,000 is still a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider it.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there yet. $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price represents a good compromise and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
