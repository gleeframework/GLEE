Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is too low, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. Would you consider $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While Bob is showing movement, I'm better off countering again or taking John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
