"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,575,000?  This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,500,000. Since you can buy the product for $1,500,000 from John, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially paying more. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
