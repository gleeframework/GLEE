"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is too low, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. Would you consider $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,900,000 is closer, but I still can't meet you at that price.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  To make this work for me, I need to keep it under $1,500,000.  Would you do $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,575,000?  This allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1575000.0,Alice,7,
