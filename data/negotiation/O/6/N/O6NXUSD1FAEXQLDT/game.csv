"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm starting with a price of $2000000.  This reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential for your business.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I'm seeing in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price is still fair considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm seeing in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
