Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still staying significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. This increases the likelihood of him engaging in the negotiation.
* **Justification for the price:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though I don't explicitly state what the product is.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

1. **Securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his valuation.**
2. **Maintaining the option to sell to John at my minimum acceptable price if Bob rejects the offer.**"
