"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product can bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While I appreciate your offer, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950000, reflecting a substantial discount from my initial price.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both an opportunity to benefit.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $950000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product can bring to my business.",920000.0,Bob,4,
