Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, and we can proceed to finalize the details. Looking forward to your positive response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $950,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and $950,000 is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to save money."
