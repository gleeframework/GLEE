"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good deal, it's still more than your maximum budget of $10,000.  There's room to negotiate further, especially since Alice clearly wants to sell the product. Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, a price of $7,500 is still a good deal for her.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also willing to push for a price that's more within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  While I'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $10,000.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price,  within my budget."
