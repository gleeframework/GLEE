"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be a reasonable starting point.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for this product. Could you do $18,000? "", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer.  While $18,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need, but I am willing to come down to $15,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $15,500 is your final offer, however, that price remains outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, getting $13,250 from Bob is a reasonable outcome.  It's a significant amount over his initial offer and keeps me from potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
