Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This creates room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being polite but firm.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** By starting high, I set the upper limit of the negotiation.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate until I reach a price that's acceptable to both of us. 
* **Have an alternative:**  Knowing that John will pay $1,000,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to his own valuation of the product ($800,000) than to mine ($1,000,000).  It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if we can reach a more profitable price.  

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting allows for continued negotiation:** By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Knowing my alternative:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've countered Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his initial offer but closer to his valuation. This shows willingness to compromise. 
* **Appeal to Reason:** My message highlights the benefits of this price for Bob, emphasizing the potential profit he can make.
* **Maintaining Control:** By staying above the $1,000,000 mark, I maintain the possibility of a better deal than selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By moving towards Bob's price, I show flexibility, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Negotiation Tactics:**  I'm using a combination of reasonable price adjustments and emphasizing mutual benefits to entice Bob into accepting.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I'm trying to find a price point where I maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting and forcing a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  With John standing ready to pay that amount, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high. 

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price than selling to John.
* **Securing a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum requirement.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While I could continue to counter Bob's offers, the potential returns are too low compared to the certainty of selling to John."
