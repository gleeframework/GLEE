"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($10,000) and higher than Bob's maximum budget ($15,000). 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  I'm interested in the product, but  $14,000 is a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($10,000), but it is now within Bob's budget of $15,000.
*  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's becoming risky. He's already had one counteroffer rejected, and Alice may become less willing to compromise further.
* Accepting the offer at $13,000 still saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
