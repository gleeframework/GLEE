Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum.
* **Motivational message:** The message highlights the value to Bob, which could incentivize him to accept.

**Plan:**

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer. I'll likely counter with a slightly lower price, keeping in mind my minimum and John's offer. I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I won't let the price drop too far below $1,100,000. If things get too difficult, I'll switch to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,000,000 is a decent sum, it's below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

**Plan:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $1,050,000. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. I'll be prepared to lower the price further if necessary, but I won't go below $1,000,000. If the negotiation stalls, I'll switch to John to secure the guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fantastic deal considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to work with him.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to nudge him towards acceptance.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging further negotiation.

**Plan:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll carefully consider his next offer. If it's significantly lower than $1,050,000, I might be more inclined to accept John's offer. However, if Bob's counteroffer is closer to $1,050,000, I'll likely continue negotiating, aiming to secure a price as close to $1,100,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than my starting offer. 
* **Negotiation stalling:** Bob's insistence on a lower price suggests that further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** While I'd prefer to get a higher price, John's offer provides a safe and guaranteed way to sell the product without further risk or negotiation.

**Plan:**

Since Bob's offer is below my minimum and the negotiation seems to be going nowhere, I'm opting for the sure thing with John's offer. It's a decent price, and it eliminates any potential for further price drops or a failed deal with Bob."
