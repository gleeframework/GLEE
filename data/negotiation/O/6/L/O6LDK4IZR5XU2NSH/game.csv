"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $780,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $820,000 for this product.  This is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $820,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $790,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",790000.0,Bob,6,
