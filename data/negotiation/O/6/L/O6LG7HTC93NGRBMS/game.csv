"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we start at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $11,250 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. We're getting close! I'm still a bit over my budget at $11,150. How about we split the difference and go with $11,075? This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",11075.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $11,075. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,150 and $11,075. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,112.50.",11125.0,Alice,7,
