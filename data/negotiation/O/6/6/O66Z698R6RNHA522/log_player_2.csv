"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I think you'll really appreciate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a lower price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, given the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $850,000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's well below his maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or even walk away from the deal. 
* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, indicating a willingness to compromise.  

At this point, accepting the offer is a good balance between saving money and avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether."
