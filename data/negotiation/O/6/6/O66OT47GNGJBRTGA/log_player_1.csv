Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept this price right away, it sets the stage for a negotiation that starts at a high point. 

I'm confident in the value of my product and am prepared to negotiate down from this initial offer.  I will carefully consider any counteroffers from Bob and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I will be ready to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original asking price. It's important to be firm but also flexible during negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still holding out for a bit more than his offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.  I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While I would prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing both Bob and John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
