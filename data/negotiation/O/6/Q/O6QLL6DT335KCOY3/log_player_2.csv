"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum value ($100) as possible while still getting a better deal than Alice's initial offer. $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, offering a compromise between Alice's value and Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $87, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price point. It's likely that further negotiation won't get a significantly better price, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at $100 is higher. Accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice."
