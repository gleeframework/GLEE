Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. However, I'd be willing to offer a small bonus to you if I buy the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000 and consider the bonus as a gesture of goodwill? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum price.  But, it's not worth risking a deal for a small difference. John is willing to pay my minimum and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could result in Bob walking away."
