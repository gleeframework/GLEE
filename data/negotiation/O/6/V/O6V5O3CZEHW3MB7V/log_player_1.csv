Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, emphasizing the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A price of $9,500 is close to my ideal.
* **Start negotiations on a positive note:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, which I can then address.

I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
