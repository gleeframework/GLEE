Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob a chance to make a deal, but incentivizes him to accept quickly.
* **It's lower than your ""Plan B"" price:** This ensures you're making a profit, even if Bob rejects and you sell to John."
