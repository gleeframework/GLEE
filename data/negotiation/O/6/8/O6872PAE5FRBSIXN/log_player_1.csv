I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will find this offer appealing and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though he's come up a bit.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear we're not going to agree on a price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
