"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000. It's important to start high and leave room for negotiation, especially since I don't know Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe there's room for a better deal. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a price that both of us can agree on."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I believe there's still potential for a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000.  This is a significant step down from my last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's at the lower end of my acceptable range, the negotiation has taken several rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's better to secure the sale now for $13,000 than potentially end up with John's offer of $10,000."
