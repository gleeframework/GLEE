"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that low yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10500?  This still leaves you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm happy to accept $10250. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction.  Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Alice,5,
