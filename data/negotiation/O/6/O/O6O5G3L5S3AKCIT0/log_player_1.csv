"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a high price of $2,300,000 sets a strong anchor. Even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it gives us room to negotiate down while aiming for a final price well above $1,500,000.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and expresses confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, we signal our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  We start high to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much we can push for a higher price.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** We haven't committed to Bob yet, keeping the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000 open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate, and John's offer serves as a strong fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000. This signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justify the Price:** We're reiterating the product's unique value proposition to counter Bob's market value argument and keep the price anchored above his initial offer.
* **Aiming High:**  We're still aiming high, significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum.  There's room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed. 
* **Preserving the John Option:**  We haven't committed to Bob yet, keeping the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that:

* **Bob Walks Away:** He stated this is his ""final offer for now."" Pushing harder could make him lose interest.
* **We Waste Rounds:**  We still have a good offer on the table. Spending more rounds negotiating might not yield a significantly better outcome.

Accepting $1,400,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
