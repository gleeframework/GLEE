"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a more limited budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be honest, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? That would work much better for my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
