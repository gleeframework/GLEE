"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly tempting, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  This is my final offer in this range, as I'm confident it won't be available at this price for long.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. This is my final offer in this range.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work. Let's settle at $2,025,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  I need a decision on this today, as I have other interested parties.",2025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $1,950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
