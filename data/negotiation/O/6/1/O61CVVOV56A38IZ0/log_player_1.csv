Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100, so you need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for you. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):**  While not implemented here, starting slightly higher than your target price can leave room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that.

By offering the product at $119, you create a win-win situation where Bob gets a perceived discount and you maximize your potential profit."
