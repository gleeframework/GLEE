"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
