"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its true value. With that in mind, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but the price point you're suggesting is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. This tactic aims to see how flexible Alice is willing to be.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is key to a successful negotiation. We want to keep the conversation going.
* **Clear Intention:** We clearly state our desired price and willingness to purchase at that price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to listen to your proposal. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?
