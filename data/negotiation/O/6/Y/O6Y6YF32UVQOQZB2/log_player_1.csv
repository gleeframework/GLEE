Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you'd accept $100 from John, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your true value sets a firm anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this specific scenario (since Bob values it lower), a higher initial offer leaves space if Bob wants to counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer since he only values the product at $80. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain if Bob is willing to negotiate higher than his perceived value."
