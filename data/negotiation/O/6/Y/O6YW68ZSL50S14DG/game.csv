"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This gives you a good deal, and I can still cover my costs.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13,800, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",13800.0,Alice,5,
