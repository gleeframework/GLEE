{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to aim for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This gives you a good deal, and I can still cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a higher number."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13,800, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting frustrating and Bob's offers are too low. It's time to cut our losses and sell to John for $15,000. This will ensure I meet my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
