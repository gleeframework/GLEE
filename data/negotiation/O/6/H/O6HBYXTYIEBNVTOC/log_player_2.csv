```

**Reasoning:**

* You are trying to bridge the gap between your previous offer of $125 and Alice's current offer of $140. 
* Offering $130 shows willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $145 is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still above your desired range.
* We're already at round 5, and there's a risk of Alice becoming stubborn and refusing to lower her price further.
* It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers and counter-offering, as you might run out of rounds and be forced to buy at a higher price.
* It's more efficient to buy from John at $150 to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget."
