Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It's also significantly less than my minimum price, allowing me to potentially reach a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,600 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, $9,600 is a decent price considering Bob's limited budget.  It's important to balance potential profit with the possibility of a longer negotiation or a sale to John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively good outcome."
