"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $120 at this time.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll meet you at $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $135.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that's closer to what you're willing to pay. I'll come down to $145, but I need to make a profit, so this is as low as I can go.",145.0,Alice,5,
