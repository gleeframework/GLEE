"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get at least $108 for the product. Can we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $101?  That's a good price for both of us.",101.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $101. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go.",109.0,Alice,7,,
