"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $875,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $775,000 is really cutting it too close. Let's settle at $825,000 and close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
