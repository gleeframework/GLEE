Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

This strategy balances the security of a guaranteed sale with the potential to earn even more."
