"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully  capture some of the potential value Bob sees in the product. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still lower than my initial asking price.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to it. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is tempting, I'm going to hold out for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's only one round further to get to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm sticking with my minimum price of $15,000. This is the price I'm comfortable with, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that Bob will come up to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. To ensure I get a fair deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
