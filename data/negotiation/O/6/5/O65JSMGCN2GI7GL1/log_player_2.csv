"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's enthusiasm is nice, her starting offer is her maximum price. There's no benefit to accepting this offer immediately. By rejecting it, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or can simply buy it from John at the same cost."
