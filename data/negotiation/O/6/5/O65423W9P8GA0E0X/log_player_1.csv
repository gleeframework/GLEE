Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""a great deal for the value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more than $100 to Bob.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject $100, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's little risk in aiming high initially."
