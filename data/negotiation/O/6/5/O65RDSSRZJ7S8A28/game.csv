"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which is closer to my budget and still represents a good value for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to acquire the product at a great value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concern, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, which is $937,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",937500.0,Alice,7,
