Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""a steal"" and ""great deal,"" you aim to frame the price in a positive light, even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay up to $150 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $150 matches what John is willing to pay, it's at the absolute lowest point I'm willing to accept.  There's no room for further negotiation with Bob. Since I can get my minimum acceptable price from John without further haggling, it makes the most sense to sell to him directly."
