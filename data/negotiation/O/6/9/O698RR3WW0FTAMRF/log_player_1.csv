Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you a good margin.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It aims to keep the negotiation amicable and open to potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves a smaller profit margin.  It's worth exploring if Bob is willing to go higher.  By rejecting, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a profit.
* **Midpoint:**  $125 is the middle ground between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($110), making it a logical point for compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation open and avoid any negative feelings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $110 was a bit optimistic. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price and saves us both some time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is a good compromise and is close to my desired price of $125.  It's a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while also ensuring a quick sale. Accepting this offer is a good way to end the negotiation and secure a successful outcome.  While I could potentially try for a higher price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially considering the possibility of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and leaving me with only the option to sell to John for $100."
