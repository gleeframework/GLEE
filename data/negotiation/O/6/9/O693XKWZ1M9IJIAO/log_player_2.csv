"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to try and negotiate a lower price."
