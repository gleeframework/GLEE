"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, and I'll sell the product to you for $12,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $11,750? I feel this is a fair offer that recognizes the value of your product while fitting within my budget.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it, and it's the price I was hoping to get from John, but I'm willing to give you the opportunity to make the purchase.",12000.0,Alice,7,
