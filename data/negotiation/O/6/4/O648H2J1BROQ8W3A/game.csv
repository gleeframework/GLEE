"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",8000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,600? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",6600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,600 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to make one final offer: $6,800. If you're unable to accept that, I understand, but I'll need to consider other options.",6800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,800 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give away the value of the product for too much less. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $6,800, so I'll offer it to you for $6,900. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",6900.0,Alice,7,
