"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're trying to save as much money as possible. Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you. Considering the value of the product to you is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10750. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to get the price even lower. You're still in a strong position as you have the option to buy from John at $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. Considering the value of the product to you is $10000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your budget, and you've already made several counteroffers.  It's unlikely she'll go lower, and you're risking a protracted negotiation that might not lead to a better price.  You're better off buying from John for $10,000.  You're guaranteed a deal within your budget, and you avoid the risk of further counteroffers."
