"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with a price that low. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating, and I'm not ready to give up yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,125?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10125}

Round 6

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still not happy with the price, and I think I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $10,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
