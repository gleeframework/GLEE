Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,100,000. This would allow both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
