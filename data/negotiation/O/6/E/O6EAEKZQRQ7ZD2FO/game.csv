"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,100,000. This would allow both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1,150,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
