"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point while allowing for potential concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal through further negotiation with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue exploring those possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this, let's close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1,075,000, so I'll stick with that offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge on his price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm nearing the end of my rounds and the risk of getting stuck with a lower price is increasing.  Selling to John guarantees my desired price, so it's the best option at this point."
