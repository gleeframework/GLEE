"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12500. This is as close to your original offer as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I've already made a counteroffer of $11000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000. Can you accept this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
