"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always good to try and negotiate for a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $150, but you don't want to pay full price if you can avoid it. Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for a product of this quality, so let me know if you're still interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from $150 to $135, which is within your budget and a decent price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or that you'll waste time in back-and-forth.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
