Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $12,000 for the product because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **The Gap:**  There's a $2,000 difference between what you need and what Bob values the product at.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, which is your leverage.

**Strategy**

Your best bet is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but still above his perceived value. This requires finding a balance to avoid being too greedy and losing him to a rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's a significant savings for Bob compared to your alternative offer from John, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **The Message:**
    * It's polite and professional.
    * It emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
    * The ""limited-time offer"" creates urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a walk-away point in mind (your absolute minimum price). 
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If you drive too hard a bargain, it could damage future interactions."
