"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above your ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You still have 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value for the product. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. I want to see if she's willing to budge and if she rejects, I'll be able to gauge her willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is within my acceptable range. While I'd ideally like to pay less, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer secures the product within my budget and avoids further uncertainty."
