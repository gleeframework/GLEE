"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close, but I'm still holding out for more. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility but still remaining above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of time,  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to meet in the middle. This offer is still higher than Bob's last offer but reflects the urgency of the situation. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gain.  While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, I'm running out of time and John's offer guarantees my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John."
