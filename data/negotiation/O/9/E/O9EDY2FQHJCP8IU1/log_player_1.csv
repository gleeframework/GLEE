Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still lower than John's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a new price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his price point. This could encourage him to accept, but it still ensures I'm earning more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's getting closer and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
