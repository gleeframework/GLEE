"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  This price would still allow you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me. Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,250. Can you consider this offer?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get the best price, and I respect that!  However, $13,250 is still a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's try $13,400. It's a small adjustment, but it would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal.",13400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still not willing to budge too much, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,350, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",13350.0,Bob,6,
