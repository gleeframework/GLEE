"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1100000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price lower by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to create a more favorable negotiation position.
* **Reasoned Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the desire for a better deal, rather than simply rejecting the initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $950,000 is a significant discount, it's still above your maximum budget, allowing for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you already rejected her first offer. You can likely get the price down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying it from John for that same price. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Stating this is your final offer creates a sense of urgency and limits further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning John's offer reinforces your bargaining position and shows you're not desperate. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $1,000,000 is a compromise, showing you're willing to meet halfway but not budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of the value this product can bring to you, and I'm willing to meet you at $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only $20,000 less than your maximum budget. While you could counteroffer again, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to budge further.  At this point, buying from John is the most financially advantageous option, as it secures the product for your maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
