"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",102.5,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $96 is still a bit too low for me. How about $100? That way we both get what we want.",100.0,Alice,5,
