"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $120 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $100 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
