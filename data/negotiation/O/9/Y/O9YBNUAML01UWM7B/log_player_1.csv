Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$14,000 is still below my minimum, but Bob is showing interest. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant price for a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting his offer is the best option to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of a lower price or going with John."
