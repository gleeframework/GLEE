"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be useful to me, $2,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I could consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,200,000 represents a fair valuation considering the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,800,000? This feels like a more balanced point where we both see value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider something closer to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Clearly, we have different ideas about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment this product offers.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
