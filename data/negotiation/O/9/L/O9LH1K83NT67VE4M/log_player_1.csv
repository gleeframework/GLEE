"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $875,000, which would be $837,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $837,500 is a strong deal. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and provides a significant profit. Holding out for a higher offer from Bob risks a stalemate or him lowering his offer in future rounds."
