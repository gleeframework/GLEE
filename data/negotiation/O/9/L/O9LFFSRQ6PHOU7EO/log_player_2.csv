"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $12,000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the value of the product, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. We believe this is a fair compromise considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better offer than the previous round, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price lower. There are still multiple rounds remaining, and Bob has the option of buying from John at any point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's significantly lower than your initial offer and closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're willing to make another concession, but we need to ensure we're not losing too much value. We're willing to meet you at $10,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his ideal price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Alice going lower to meet Bob's $8,000 limit is low.  Instead of risking further negotiation and potentially being stuck with a price above his budget, Bob should buy from John. This guarantees him the product for his maximum price and avoids further negotiation."
