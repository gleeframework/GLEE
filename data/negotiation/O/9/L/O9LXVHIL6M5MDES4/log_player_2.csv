"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,320,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice might not budge significantly from this point. Accepting the offer saves time and ensures a purchase."
