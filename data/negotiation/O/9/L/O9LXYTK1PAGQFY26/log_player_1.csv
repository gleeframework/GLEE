Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you even closer to his maximum.
* **Above Your Minimum:** This price ensures you make a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. You'll always get more than John's $10,000 offer."
