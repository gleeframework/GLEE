"I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer you $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still reflects the value the product brings. How about $13,500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $13,500 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer you $13,250 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. Let's see if we can make this work.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we meet in the middle between $13,250 and $13,500? I'm thinking $13,375. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",13375.0,Alice,5,
