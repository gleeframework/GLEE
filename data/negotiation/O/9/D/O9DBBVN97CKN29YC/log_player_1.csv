Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your valuation, but I believe I can provide you with a fair deal. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, given my financial constraints and the current market conditions, I am unable to meet the price of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and accepting $1,600,000 is still a significant profit over John's offer."
