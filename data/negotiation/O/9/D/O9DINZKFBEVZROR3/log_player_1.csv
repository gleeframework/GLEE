"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential"" and ""significant benefits"" of the product aims to frame the price in a positive light, even if it seems high initially.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This opening offer sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, our subsequent offers will likely seem more reasonable in comparison."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a compromise, I'm proposing $2,100,000. This price reflects the unique features and substantial benefits this product offers you."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We politely decline Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's significantly undervaluing the product. 
* **Gradual Concession:**  We make a substantial concession of $200,000 from our initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Reiteration:** We continue to highlight the product's ""unique features"" and ""substantial benefits"" to justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While we are moving closer to Bob's offer, we are still aiming for a price significantly above his perceived value and our absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now closer to our minimum acceptable price, his ""final offer"" statement introduces a sense of urgency and potential impasse. We still have negotiating room and time on our side (6 rounds left). It's worth testing his resolve by rejecting and presenting a counteroffer that keeps us above our absolute minimum while still showing movement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $1,950,000 is a significant investment, I understand the value this product brings. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** We start by acknowledging Bob's ""final offer"" and the value he sees in the product.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a smaller concession this round ($100,000), signaling that we are nearing our bottom line while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Framing the Price:** We emphasize that $2,000,000 is still a ""considerable concession"" and a reflection of our desire to work with Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:** By holding firm at a price above our minimum, we are subtly pushing Bob to consider that this might be his best chance to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $2,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a smart financial decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, securing a substantial profit.
* **Shift in Tone:** Bob's message suggests a greater willingness to compromise, expressing genuine interest and budget limitations.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or pushing for even lower prices. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows us to re-invest the proceeds, potentially generating further returns. 

While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a marginally better outcome. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,900,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point."
