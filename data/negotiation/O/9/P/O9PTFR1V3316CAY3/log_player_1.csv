Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for us both."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($20,000 vs. $8,000) but lower than John's offer,  Alice leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to her desired outcome.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. This avoids an immediate rejection and keeps the door open for finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice knows John will pay $15,000, securing her minimum acceptable price. This knowledge empowers her to confidently negotiate with Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob while recognizing he might reject the offer. 
* Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price to find a point where both she and Bob feel like they're getting a fair deal."
