"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to recoup a reasonable portion of the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to recoup a reasonable portion of the product's value, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. How about $950,000? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $1,025,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, as you're acquiring a valuable asset for significantly less than its worth to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think we can do a bit better. How about $975,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
