"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500? ",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget is tight, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,750 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. Let's see if we can close the deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
