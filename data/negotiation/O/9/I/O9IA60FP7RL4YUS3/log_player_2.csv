It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000 since you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price from Alice."

It's still better to reject Alice's offer. Even though $11,000 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to get a better deal by making another counteroffer. There's always a chance Alice will budge to avoid losing the sale altogether."

It's time to buy from John! While Alice is getting closer to your desired price,  it's not worth risking further negotiation. You've established a good baseline with John, and there's no guarantee Alice will meet your price. It's best to secure the product at your target price and move on."
