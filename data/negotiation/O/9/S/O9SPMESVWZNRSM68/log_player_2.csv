This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** She has stated this is her final offer and given her previous concessions, it seems unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Savings:**  While not ideal, you're still saving $90,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Pushing further could make Alice walk away, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
