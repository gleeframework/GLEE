Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room:**  $110 is still less than the value I've placed on the product ($100), so if Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price without losing money.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Value:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can secure a higher price.  I can counter with a price closer to $100. 
* **Potential for a Deal:** If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $100.  How about $95?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price slightly higher than his offer but still significantly less than my initial asking price. 
* **Testing the Limits:** $95 allows me to see how serious Bob is about buying the product. If he's genuinely interested, he might be willing to pay this price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By taking this small step, I'm creating a sense of progress in the negotiation and making it more likely that we'll reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $92 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:**  Bob's final offer of $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** There's little room for further negotiation.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and a quick, hassle-free transaction. 

While I'm slightly disappointed I couldn't get more from Bob, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
