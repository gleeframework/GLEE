Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide tremendous value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still too high for me.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm determined to save as much as possible. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
