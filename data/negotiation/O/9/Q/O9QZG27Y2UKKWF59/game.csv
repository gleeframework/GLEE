"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my maximum spending limit is $800,000,  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and  allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I've had considerable interest in this product, and to be completely transparent, I have another offer closer to my asking price. However, I value our conversation and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Considering my maximum budget is $800,000,  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,500,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest and effort during this negotiation.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
