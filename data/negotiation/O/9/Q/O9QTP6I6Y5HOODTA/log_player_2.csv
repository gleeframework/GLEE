"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  The highest price you're willing to pay. 
* **Strategy:**  Negotiating is always worth a shot. There's a chance Alice is willing to lower the price, and even if she doesn't, you can still fall back on John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This sets a clear expectation that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,000,000 is still a substantial amount, but it leaves space for potential counteroffers without risking too much.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While this might seem like a large discount, there's a good chance Alice needs to sell the product and might accept a counteroffer closer to my initial offer than her original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has already lowered her price significantly, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for Further Savings:** While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above my desired range.  I believe there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to meet her halfway while still maintaining a strong negotiation position.
* **Building Momentum:** This counteroffer demonstrates a commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Keeping Options Open:** By staying within my budget, I'm still in a strong position to either accept a further counteroffer or move to John if necessary."
