Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it's:

* **Slightly lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing your minimum goal.
* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a sense of potential savings and makes him more likely to consider your offer.
* **Open to discussion:** The message invites Bob to engage in further conversation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for your product. This is the highest amount I am comfortable spending, given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I will consider your latest offer of $880,000. However, I must respectfully decline. My maximum budget remains at $850,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and it seems like further negotiation with him will not reach a satisfactory price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further haggling."
