"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. Can you consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. However, $9,800 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $10,200.  This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
