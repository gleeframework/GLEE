"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is too high. While it's lower than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to purchase from John at a lower price."
