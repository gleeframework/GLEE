Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Why not higher?**

Going too close to $1,000,000 might make Bob balk and assume there's no room for negotiation. 

**Why not lower?**

A significantly lower price leaves money on the table.  The strategy is to aim high and adjust if necessary, knowing John provides a guaranteed $800,000 backup."
