"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Its value is immense and I know you'll recognize that.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given its potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I'm seeing in this product, I'm willing to go as high as $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident that it can generate significantly more value for you. To move us closer, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects its inherent worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a substantial amount and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
