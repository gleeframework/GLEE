``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I'm seeing in this product, I'm willing to go as high as $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident that it can generate significantly more value for you. To move us closer, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects its inherent worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a substantial amount and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
