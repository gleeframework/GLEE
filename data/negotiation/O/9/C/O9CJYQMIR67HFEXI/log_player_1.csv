Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $12,000 is above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's likely to find $12,000 appealing.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have space to negotiate without going below your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is still a decent price, it's lower than the $12,000 you initially offered. You're willing to go down to $8,000 to sell to John, but there's room for negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we settle on $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while staying above your minimum.
* **Appeal to value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him ($15,000) can help him see the value in the offer.
* **Reasonable price:** $11,000 is a reasonable compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
