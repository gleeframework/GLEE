Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $15,000.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal while still earning a good profit."
