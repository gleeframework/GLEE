"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while still staying within his budget.  Offering $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Alice's value of $12,000 but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It also gives Alice a more enticing offer than the $12,000 she'd receive if she sold to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget, and it's closer to Bob's original counteroffer of $13,000. There is a risk of Alice rejecting this offer, but it's likely that she'll accept it to avoid a lengthy negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
