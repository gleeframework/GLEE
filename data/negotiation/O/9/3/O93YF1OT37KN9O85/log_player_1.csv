{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $900,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. 
* **Open Communication:**  Encouraging Bob to respond with his thoughts helps keep the negotiation amicable and open to potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, his interest in the product is clear.  There's room for a counteroffer to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, giving me strong leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer with Justification:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a counteroffer. I'm justifying the price with a clear reason (reflecting the value of the product).
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  $850,000 is a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. It increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still holding onto my ability to sell to John for $1,000,000, reminding Bob that I have options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $750,000 is still below my acceptable range, and I'm risking a significant loss.
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and showing willingness to negotiate, so there's still room to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is my safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, providing me with strong leverage.  

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I will aim for a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $750,000 is still too far from my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant concession.  This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget. I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price further, but still staying within a range that's close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm reminding Bob that I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, keeping the pressure on him to negotiate fairly.
* **Open for Discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, showing that I'm open to continued dialogue and finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** $800,000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. 
* **Risk of Losing a Sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and there's no guarantee that I can get a higher price in further negotiations.
* **Time Consideration:** The negotiation has taken several rounds, and I'm already close to my minimum. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the time spent negotiating and secures a sale.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is ideal, accepting Bob's offer still results in a significant profit. It's a good compromise, considering the time and potential risks involved."
