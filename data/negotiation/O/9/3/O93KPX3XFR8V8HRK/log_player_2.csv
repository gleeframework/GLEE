"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet all your needs. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $12000 to you. To make this opportunity even more appealing, I am offering it to you today for $15000. This is a special introductory price, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 at this time. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that could work for both of us. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to lower the price to $14000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with an excellent deal. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still $2,000 over Bob's maximum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice is willing to drop the price further.  John is a safe option, but Bob wants to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still stuck at $12,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product at $13500. This is the lowest price I can comfortably offer while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still $1,500 over Bob's maximum budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of a deal falling through is increasing.  Bob has already reached his maximum acceptable price, and he's not willing to go higher.  John is a guaranteed purchase at Bob's price point.  The risk of continued negotiation is higher than the potential reward of saving an additional $1,500."
