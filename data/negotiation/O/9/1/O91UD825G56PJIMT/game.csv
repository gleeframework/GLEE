"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $15,000?  This is my maximum budget, but I'm confident this product is worth it.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $16,500?  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to make a good deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm still only able to go up to $15,000.  It's my final offer, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
