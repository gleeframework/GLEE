"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I could consider a purchase price of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still too steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $900,000 if you're open to it. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's land on $1,100,000 and get this deal done. This product has the potential to bring you significant value, and I believe this is a fair offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
