Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob values it at or above that price.  It's a significant profit for you over John's offer and still a potential gain for Bob considering his valuation is $800,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
