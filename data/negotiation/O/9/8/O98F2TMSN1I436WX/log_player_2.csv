"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. It's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Alice has come down to $115, which is still a good deal for you since the product is worth $150 to you. Accepting this offer will save you $35 compared to buying from John."
