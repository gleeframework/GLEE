Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, at $900,000, knowing it's above his perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can secure a higher price through further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $875,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned that I might not be able to reach a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me the desired value and ensures I don't lose out on a better deal."
