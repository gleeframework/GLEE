Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and still provides a decent profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000.  Rejecting allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but it also acknowledges that you're willing to negotiate."
