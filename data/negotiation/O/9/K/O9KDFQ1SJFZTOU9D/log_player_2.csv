"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get the product for $8,000 from John. Therefore, it's logical to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $8,000 price from John, but understands the need to be realistic with Alice. Offering $8,500 presents a significant discount for Alice while still leaving room for potential counteroffers. This strategy balances Bob's desire for a lower price with the need to keep the negotiation alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price from John ($8,000). However, it's closer to Bob's maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

Given the risk and the fact that $9,500 is within Bob's budget, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice in this scenario."
