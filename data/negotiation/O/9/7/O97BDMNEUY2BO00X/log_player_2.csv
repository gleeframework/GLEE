"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is far above your budget. You'll need to counter-offer and see if you can reach a price closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? I'm open to discussing a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price.  Reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to get closer to your goal of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go for $9,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, which is $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer, it's still above your budget.  You should continue negotiating to see if you can get even lower. You have more rounds left and you're closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the absolute minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is tempting, you're still $2,000 above your ideal price. You've come a long way, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better deal.  You have a few more rounds to get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, and I believe that's a fair compromise. It's a small step for you, but it makes a big difference for me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900, but I'm not budging any further. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have one round left and are only $100 away from your target price. However, you've been pushing hard and there's a strong chance that Alice will not budge further.  It's better to take the sure thing with John and secure the product for your desired price."
