"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,150,000. How about we meet at $1,120,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $1,130,000.  That's just a small step up from your offer, but it's the closest I can come right now. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset for your business.",1130000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,120,000. How about we meet at $1,125,000? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
