Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim for the highest possible price with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still get a price above your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $149 seems like a ""deal"" compared to a round number like $150, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives the product as scarce or highly desirable."
