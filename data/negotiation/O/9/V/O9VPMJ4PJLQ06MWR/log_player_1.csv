Bob's offer:

While I could try to push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 is a smart move at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $825,000 is a healthy profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has risks. Bob could lowball again, or I might miss out entirely and get stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the money sooner, allowing me to reinvest or use it elsewhere. 

It's always tempting to try for the absolute highest price, but in this case, securing a strong profit outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal with more rounds of negotiation."
