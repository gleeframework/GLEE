"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120, Bob can still potentially save money by counter-offering.  The goal is to get the price as low as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, Bob can likely get the price down further by making another counteroffer. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage."
