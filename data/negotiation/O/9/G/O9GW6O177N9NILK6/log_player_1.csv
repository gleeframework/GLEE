"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a little low, but it's a good starting point for negotiations. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I think this price is fair and gives us both some room to maneuver in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved up to $11,500, which is only $500 less than my last counteroffer. It's getting close to my target price, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk losing him.  I'm going to accept his offer."
