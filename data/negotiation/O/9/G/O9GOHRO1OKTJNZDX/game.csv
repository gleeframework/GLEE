"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep. How about we split the difference and agree on $13,500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",13500.0,Bob,4,
