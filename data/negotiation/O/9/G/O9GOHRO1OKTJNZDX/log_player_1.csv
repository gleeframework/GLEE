"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep. How about we split the difference and agree on $13,500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.
