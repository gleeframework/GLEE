"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I aim for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I need to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my target. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still a significant profit for me.  It shows Bob that I'm flexible but also determined to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is dropping the price, and while $930,000 is still a considerable sum, I'm not yet ready to sell. My goal is to maximize profit, and there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest proposal. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While the offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal I can get. I believe I can squeeze out more profit.  I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm going to counter with $935,000. This is my final counteroffer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob's offers are dropping below my target. While $915,000 is a lot of money, I'm not confident I can get more from Bob, and I'm running out of rounds.  

To ensure I don't end up with less than my minimum, I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
