"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial price.  I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum.  I want to see if I can bridge the gap and find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $115 is close to my minimum, I still want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. There's still time left in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $125. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to what I think the product is worth.  It's a fair middle ground, and hopefully Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely."
