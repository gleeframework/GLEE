"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I understand we're both looking for a win-win. How about $1,150,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you. Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the effort, I'd like to propose $1,125,000 as the price for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the transaction within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
