"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Showing flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob feel more comfortable and open to a deal. 
* **Building rapport:**  I'm starting with a friendly greeting to establish a good relationship with Bob. 

**Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still in a strong position and can likely get a better deal. It's early in the negotiation, and rejecting Bob's offer gives me more leverage. I'll aim for a price closer to $900,000 in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit far from my target price.  Let's compromise at $875,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not by much.  This shows a willingness to compromise while also pushing for a better price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and respectful tone, building on the rapport established in the first round. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price. This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850000. Can we meet at $860000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $860,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum. I'm willing to go lower, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the better option, as I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $865,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 865000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows my commitment to reaching a compromise and signals my intention to close the deal.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price is beneficial to both of us, highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to reach a final agreement in this round, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price and don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $860000. Can we meet at $855000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge much further. While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly likely that we'll end up at a price that's too low for me.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've exhausted my negotiation options with Bob and it's not worth risking losing more money trying to squeeze out a few more dollars."
