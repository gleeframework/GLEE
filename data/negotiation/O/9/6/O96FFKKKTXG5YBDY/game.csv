"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13000. It's still a great deal considering its value, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussion. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about we meet at $9000? I think that's a fair price for a product like this, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $11000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000, which is $10000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
