Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows room for potential concessions if needed. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm willing to hold out for a better price."
