Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Closer to Bob's Value:** By starting closer to $1,500,000 (Bob's value), you're more likely to keep him engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring a good profit if Bob accepts. 

This strategy balances ambition with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and are willing to negotiate further. We still have room to go lower before reaching John's offer of $1,000,000, our absolute bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe this product holds significantly more value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. By suggesting a price exactly between the previous two offers, it signals fairness and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a healthy profit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal more about Bob's willingness to pay. If he accepts, you've secured a great deal. If he rejects it, you can re-evaluate and decide if you want to negotiate further or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider $1,220,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely negotiate for a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,220,000 is getting close to our acceptable range. Each additional round of negotiation carries the risk of him walking away.
* **Strong Profit:** This price still represents a significant profit margin over our minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Securing the deal now rather than risking further negotiation or moving to John's lower offer has its own value. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush."
