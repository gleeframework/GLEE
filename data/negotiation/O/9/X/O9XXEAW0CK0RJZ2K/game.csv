"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. It's a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
