{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've invested a lot in, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's slightly above your minimum:** This gives you some room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.
* **It's within Bob's perceived value:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he's likely to consider this offer seriously.

You can always adjust the price based on Bob's reaction, but this starting point sets you up to potentially earn more than your minimum while still remaining attractive to Bob."
