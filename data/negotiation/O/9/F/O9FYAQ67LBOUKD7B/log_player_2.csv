"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $11,500."
