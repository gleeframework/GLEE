{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a high starting point, potentially leading to a better outcome for me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I also have a fallback option with John, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $150.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
This counteroffer is still above Bob's valuation but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to agree. If not, I still have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  To guarantee a profit above my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
