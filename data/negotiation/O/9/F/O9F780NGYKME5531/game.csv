"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
