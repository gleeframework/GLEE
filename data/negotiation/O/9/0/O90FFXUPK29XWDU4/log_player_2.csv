Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but I still think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to consider $13,625, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. How about we do $13,750? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the absolute lowest price we could hope for, it's a good deal.  Waiting any longer risks Alice withdrawing the offer, and we'd end up paying John's full price of $15,000. Accepting $13,750 secures a significant discount."
