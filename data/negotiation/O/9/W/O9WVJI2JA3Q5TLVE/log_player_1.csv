{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it is still lower than the minimum you are willing to accept. This will hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. It's better to try and negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $130. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired value.  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a better option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
