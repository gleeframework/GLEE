Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring we get more than our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Create Urgency (Implied):** By offering a price just below our guarantee, we subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $100. If we had that information, we could adjust our strategy accordingly."
