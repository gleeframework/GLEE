"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm eager to work with you, but unfortunately, I can't go higher than this.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product brings and leaves room for a profitable venture on your end.  What are your thoughts?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,850,000. However, this is still outside my budget.  Considering the value of the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
