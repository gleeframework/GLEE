"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still above your target of $800,000.
* **You have more negotiation rounds available.** There's no need to rush into accepting a deal that's not ideal, especially when you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer provides a baseline.**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $800,000 gives you a strong reference point for counteroffers."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $850,000, which is closer to my target price of $800,000. 
* **Fair compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it also leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer if she wants to.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in with my target price yet, as I have several rounds left to try and reach an agreement."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still $75,000 higher. I'm determined to get the best possible deal.
* **More rounds left:**  I have 7 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get an even better price.
* **John's offer is still an option:**  Remember, I can always go with John's offer for $800,000 if I'm not satisfied with Alice's price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive move:**  I'm getting closer to my target price, but still leaving a bit of room for Alice to come down.
* **Pressure point:** By offering $825,000, I'm putting some pressure on Alice. If she wants to close the deal quickly, she might accept.
* **Strategic move:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will trigger a negotiation back and forth, potentially leading to a final price that's more favorable to me."

* **More rounds to negotiate:** With 5 rounds left, I have time to push for a better price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I can always choose John's offer for $800,000, so I don't need to rush into accepting anything right now."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:**  I'm getting very close to my target price of $800,000, but still leaving a little room for Alice to make a counteroffer.
* **Pressure tactic:** This counteroffer shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, and I'm willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With fewer rounds left, I'm taking a slightly higher risk by going lower. However, I believe it could lead to a faster negotiation and a better final price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 805000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** I'm making a final, strong offer close to my target price. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** With only two rounds left, this is a calculated risk. If Alice rejects, I'll likely have to accept John's offer, but if she accepts, I'll have saved a significant amount.
* **Negotiation pressure:**  I'm hoping this offer forces Alice to make a quick decision, potentially leading to a deal in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One round left:** This is my final chance to negotiate with Alice.
* **Close, but not ideal:** Alice's offer is only $20,000 higher than my target price, but I'm not sure I can get her to go lower in just one round. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Since I can always purchase from John for $800,000, it's a safer option than risking another round of negotiation with Alice. It's better to secure a deal that's within my budget than to gamble on a potentially better price."
