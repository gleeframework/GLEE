Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can leverage that as a minimum. Offering the product to Bob at $15,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perception of value:**  While I know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be willing to pay his maximum. 
* **Risk tolerance:** A higher initial offer increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. However, it also leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Alternative buyers:** While John provides a safety net, exploring other potential buyers could yield even better offers."
