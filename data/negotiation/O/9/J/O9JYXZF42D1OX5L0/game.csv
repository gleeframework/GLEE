"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about we try $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there at $125.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $115. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $118? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $118 is still a little too high for me. Let's try $116. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",116.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $116. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $119? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",119.0,Alice,7,
