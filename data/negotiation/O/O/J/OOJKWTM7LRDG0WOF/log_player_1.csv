"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but it still gives Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a better price. I'm going to try and push for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise, but I think it still shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm concerned that if I continue to reject, Bob will walk away and I'll be stuck with selling to John for $150.  $170 is a good compromise and still a significant profit for me."
