"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in.  It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I understand it's a significant investment, but this product is truly unique and has the potential to bring you great value. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a great investment.",11000.0,Bob,4,
