"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value our ongoing discussions, but $10000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which reflects the true value of the product.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
