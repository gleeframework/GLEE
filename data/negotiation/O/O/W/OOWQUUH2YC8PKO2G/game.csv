"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Alice,5,
