"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $17,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $18,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",18000.0,Bob,4,
