This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $800,000, a full $200,000 less than John's offer and $400,000 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, meaning pushing further could lead to a dead end.
* **Limited Rounds:** You have three rounds left, but there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal with Alice. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer is high. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids that risk."
