"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is below what I can realistically accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant price reduction for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  This price represents a substantial discount for you, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on this unique product. Let's make this deal happen!

Alice seems quite firm on a price above my budget. It's unlikely she'll go below $1,200,000, and I can get it for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the better deal."
