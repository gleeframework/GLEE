"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is below what I can realistically accept.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant price reduction for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.  This price represents a substantial discount for you, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on this unique product. Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
