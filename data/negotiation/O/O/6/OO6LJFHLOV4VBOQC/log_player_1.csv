Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your $10,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counter and for you to potentially find a price you both agree on. 
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a high price, you demonstrate that you believe in your product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but your price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the $14,000 offer and leaves less room for profit. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a compromise I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $11,750 is still a decent profit, especially considering he's already rejected two of my offers.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
