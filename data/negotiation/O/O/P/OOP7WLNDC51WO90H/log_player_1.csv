{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but below my minimum desired price of $150. This creates room for negotiation while still potentially securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $85.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $105?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
