Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows us to potentially secure a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of a good deal for Bob (saving him $50,000 from its value to him) while still staying close to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving us the option to either accept or politely decline and proceed with John. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome in this negotiation."
