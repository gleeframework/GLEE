Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's favorable for you.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.  This lack of information on his part works in your favor. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide if you want to lower your asking price or hold firm knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
