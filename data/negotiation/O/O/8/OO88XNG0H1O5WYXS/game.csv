"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair starting point.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind for the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we try $700,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
