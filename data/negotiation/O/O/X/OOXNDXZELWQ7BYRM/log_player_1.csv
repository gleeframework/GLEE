{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts with a slight markup, aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and sell to him, I'd be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market price. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Since I can secure the full $1,000,000 from John, it's more financially beneficial to sell to him and end the negotiation with Bob."
