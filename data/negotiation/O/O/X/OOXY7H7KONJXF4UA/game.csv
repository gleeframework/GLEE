"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1100000? This is a significant price reduction and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can make a proposal that works for both of us. How about $1075000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1075000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1087500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. I'd like to suggest $1070000 as a compromise. This allows us to stay within my budget while still providing value to me.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
