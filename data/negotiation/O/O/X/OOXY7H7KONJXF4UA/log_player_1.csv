Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a better price in the next round.  I'm also considering the risk of losing the deal if I push too hard. I'll see if I can find a middle ground in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? This is a significant price reduction and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement with you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me see if I can make a proposal that works for both of us. How about $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup option, but I'd prefer to close this deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. I'd like to suggest $1070000 as a compromise. This allows us to stay within my budget while still providing value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been pushing for a higher price, but Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, I risk losing the deal altogether.  While I'd prefer to get a better price, selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale and avoids further risk."
