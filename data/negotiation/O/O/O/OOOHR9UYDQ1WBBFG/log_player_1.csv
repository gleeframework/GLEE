Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you're not giving away too much value.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob and increases the likelihood of acceptance. 

By starting with a strong offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price.  

You can likely push Bob a bit higher by making a counteroffer that is still attractive to him but closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my desired price and a significant improvement from his initial offer.  Accepting his offer ensures a good sale and avoids further negotiation, which could risk a lower price or a sale to John for a significantly lower amount."
