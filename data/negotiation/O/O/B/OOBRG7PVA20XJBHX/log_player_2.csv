Round 7
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we haven't gotten Alice down to $1,000,000, this is the 9th round and she's been firm on her bottom line. It's unlikely she'll go lower. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of her walking away in the last round."
