Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value beyond Bob's estimation might make him more receptive to the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $15,000 safety net (John's offer)."
