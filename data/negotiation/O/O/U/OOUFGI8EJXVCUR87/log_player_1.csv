Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profits while leaving open the possibility of a successful deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than Bob's initial offer and is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $105 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I've already made a couple of concessions, and Bob seems unwilling to go higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a much better price."
