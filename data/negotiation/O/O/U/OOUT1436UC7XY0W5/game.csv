"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from what I believe it's truly worth, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe in the potential synergy between our companies.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
