"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much bargaining room there is. I want to reach a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000 while keeping in mind my backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

While $825,000 is closer to a fair deal, I want to see if I can push Alice a little further down. There's still room to negotiate before reaching my walk-away point of $1,000,000."

}
```

I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price below Alice's $800,000 valuation. This keeps the negotiation moving while leaving me space to concede a little more if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting close to a price point where you can make this work, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

```

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $795,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's little point in risking losing the deal for a marginal potential savings."
