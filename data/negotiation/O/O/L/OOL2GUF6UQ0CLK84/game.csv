"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. Would you be willing to come down to $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting close to a price point where you can make this work, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Alice,5,
