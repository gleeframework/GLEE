"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $8,000 is the very highest I could go.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $8,000. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  Unfortunately, I'm really at my limit.  If you can do $8,500, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit higher than your original offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $8,500. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,7,
