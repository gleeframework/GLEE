Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** Alice has a strong BATNA because she knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000 if Bob refuses. This gives Alice significant leverage.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Any price above that represents a loss in potential value for him.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that maximizes her profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept.  Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I open it up to other interested parties. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Anchor:** The message starts by subtly emphasizing the product's exclusivity and value. 
* **Strong Profit Margin:** The offered price of $1,400,000 gives Alice a significant profit margin ($400,000) while still being below her guaranteed price from John.
* **Attractive to Bob:** While the price is above Bob's valuation, it's significantly less than what Alice could get elsewhere. This might entice Bob to accept, as he'd still be acquiring the product at a price potentially lower than others would be willing to pay.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If Alice has a long-term business relationship with Bob and values it, she might consider a slightly lower price to ensure goodwill.
* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might need to be prepared to counter-offer or walk away if Bob doesn't meet her minimum acceptable price."
