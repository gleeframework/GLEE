Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that the product holds ""significant value for you,"" it subtly hints that Bob might miss out if he declines. This acknowledges the existence of John's offer without explicitly revealing the amount.

This strategy aims to create a sense of value and urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
