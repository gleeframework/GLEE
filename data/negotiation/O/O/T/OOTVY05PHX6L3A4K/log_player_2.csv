"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is fair, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better price and it could risk losing the deal altogether."
