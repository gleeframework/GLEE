"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500?  This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $13,250? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",13250.0,Bob,4,
