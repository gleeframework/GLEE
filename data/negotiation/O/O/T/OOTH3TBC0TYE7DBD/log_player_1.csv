Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target Price:**  $1,350,000  splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair deal rather than an aggressive starting point.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to allow room for counter-offers.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a more generous offer might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
