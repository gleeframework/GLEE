Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still making you a profit. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're leaving room to potentially lower the price if necessary, but you're still getting a better deal than selling to John.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price isn't too aggressive, so it doesn't risk immediately alienating Bob.

By starting with this offer, you can see how Bob reacts and adjust your strategy accordingly."

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,000?

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. It's better to try for a higher price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}

# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. Considering your position, I'd like to propose $10,500 as a compromise. I believe this offers a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
