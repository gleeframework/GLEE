This offer allows you to secure the product at a significant discount while ensuring a substantial return on my investment. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations.

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation."
