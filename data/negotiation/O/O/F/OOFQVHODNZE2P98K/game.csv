"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,400,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 still falls short of my expectations.  Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
