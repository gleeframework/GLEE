"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,500 is closer to his target, it's still higher than his maximum budget. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $11,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has been unwilling to budge below $11,000, which is still higher than Bob's budget. Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it makes more sense for Bob to purchase it from him."
