"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested. How about we settle on $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth a lot to the right buyer. Could you do something closer to $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's aiming for somewhere close to $125.  You have a viable alternative with John at $120.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice when you can secure the product for your target price right now."
