"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is less than your $150 maximum and saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
