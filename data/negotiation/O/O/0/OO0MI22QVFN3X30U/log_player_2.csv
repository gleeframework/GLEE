Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm a bit tight on budget, but I'm really interested in this product. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $960,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. Remember, I have another buyer waiting in the wings who's willing to pay $1,000,000. So, you have a limited window to secure this opportunity at a price that's still very favorable for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not going to get any closer to the original price than $920,000. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to scare me into paying more by mentioning another buyer. I'm not falling for it. I'll reject this offer and stick to my original counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm not buying the other buyer story. I've been around the block a few times, and I know when someone is trying to bluff. I'm still willing to pay $920,000 for the product. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
