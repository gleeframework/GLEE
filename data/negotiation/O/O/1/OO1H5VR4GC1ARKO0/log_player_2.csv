"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is above your maximum budget and leaves you with a smaller potential saving compared to buying from John. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John for $1,000,000."
