"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to discuss this further. How about we start at $1,100,000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
