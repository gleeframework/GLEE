"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500. This is a great deal considering its true worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $11,500 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still lower than your maximum price of $12,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
