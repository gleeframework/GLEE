"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product.  However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while also being fair for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
