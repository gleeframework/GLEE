{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  $130 is still lower than what I want, but I can't risk losing a chance for a higher price yet."

Round 3

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm sticking with $140.  I've already shown willingness to compromise, and Bob's offers haven't been very generous. I'm hoping this will make him realize he needs to come up a bit more to get the deal done."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough, and I'm running out of time. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, he'll realize he needs to be more serious about meeting my price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $138.  We're running out of time, and I need to start considering a price I'm willing to accept.  I'm hoping this small compromise will be enough to finally close the deal with Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. We're down to the wire, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than that. While I'd prefer to get more, I've tried to negotiate with Bob and it's not working. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
