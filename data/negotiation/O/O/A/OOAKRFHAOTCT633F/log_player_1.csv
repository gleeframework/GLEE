"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum desired price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, which might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, which is essential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming to maximize profit, I also want to keep the negotiation open and avoid immediately resorting to the John option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000 and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable,  it shows he's still interested.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first.

**Next Round:** I will send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is definitely too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial proposal. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of my minimum desired price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that the $9,000 price is ""good"" for Bob, subtly reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Open for Further Negotiation:**  The message leaves space for further negotiation, signaling that I'm still open to compromise but won't settle for a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,500.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $6,500 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000 and also lower than my last offer of $9,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he is showing willingness to negotiate.  I still have 6 more rounds to try and get a better price.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will send a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  That's a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above his last offer. This shows flexibility while also trying to secure a more profitable price.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm again emphasizing that the $8,000 price is ""good for both of us,"" trying to build a sense of collaboration and compromise.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""Let's see if we can close the deal"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** With 5 rounds remaining, I'm becoming more assertive in my negotiation, aiming to strike a deal that's both profitable and avoids needing to go to John."
