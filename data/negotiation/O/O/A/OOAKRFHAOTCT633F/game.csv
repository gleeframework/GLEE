"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is definitely too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,500.  Would that work for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  That's a significant reduction from my previous offer and a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
