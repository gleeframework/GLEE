"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,100,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds incredible potential for your business. Let's discuss the details further and see if this is a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Of course, I'm confident I can secure another buyer at a higher price, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
