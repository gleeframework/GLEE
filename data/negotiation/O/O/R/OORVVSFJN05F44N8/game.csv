"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $15,000? I'm confident that the product will bring you a lot of value, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make the deal work.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $15,000 is closer, it's still slightly more than I can manage. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $13,500. I believe this is a good price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, as we previously discussed. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $14,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",14250.0,Alice,7,
