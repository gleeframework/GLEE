Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, which is my guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to start higher than that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $950,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency that might push Bob to accept.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still offering a price Bob might find acceptable."
