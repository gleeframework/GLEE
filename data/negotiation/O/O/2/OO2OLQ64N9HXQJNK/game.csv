"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I'm confident this product is worth it to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12,500. Can we discuss further?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to compromise, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Can we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm open to meeting you halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $11,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go above $13,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to $12,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. What do you say?",12800.0,Alice,7,
