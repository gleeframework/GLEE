"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $125. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $100.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value to you. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $125, which is $117.50. It's still a good price, considering the product's value to you is $100.",117.5,Alice,5,
