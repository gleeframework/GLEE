You can do better than $100.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to counter and potentially get a lower price."

Alice is still asking for more than what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting her offer gives you another chance to counter and try to get closer to your goal of $90."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.

While $105 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above your target price of $90.  You have a chance to counter again and try to bring the price down further."

Alice is unwilling to budge further.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John. While it's not your ideal price, it's still within your budget, and you avoid further negotiation with Alice."
