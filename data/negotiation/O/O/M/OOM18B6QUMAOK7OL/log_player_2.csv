{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $80 to you, and you can get it from John for that price.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $150, so I'll offer you $115. Is that something you'd be interested in?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth $80 to you, and you can get it from John for that price.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, but $115 is still more than I can afford right now.  How about $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is closer to my minimum price of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $100 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $90. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
