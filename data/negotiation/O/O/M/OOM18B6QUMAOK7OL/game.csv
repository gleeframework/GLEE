,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $150, so I'll offer you $115. Is that something you'd be interested in?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $115 is still more than I can afford right now.  How about $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is closer to my minimum price of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $90. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
