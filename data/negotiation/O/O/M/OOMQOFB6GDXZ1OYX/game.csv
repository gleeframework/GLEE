"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $86.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",86.25,Alice,5,
