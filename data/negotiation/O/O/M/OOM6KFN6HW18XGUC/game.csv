"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth $8,000 to both of us, and I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $8,000. This is a fair price for a product that's worth that much to both of us. Let's close this deal now before we run out of time.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $8,000. I'm willing to go up to $7,200, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",7200.0,Bob,6,
