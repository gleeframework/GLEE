"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  $900,000 is still too high."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $825,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.

While $825,000 is a better offer than Alice's first one, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $815,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000.

Alice's offer of $815,000 is the best deal I've been offered so far, and it's still within my budget. It's time to accept and secure the purchase."
