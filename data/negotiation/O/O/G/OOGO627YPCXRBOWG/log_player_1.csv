Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiating.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to prompt Bob to respond and initiate further conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $95?  It's a fair price, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $95.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's interest and emphasizing a ""fair price"" to create a sense of progress and encourage acceptance. 
* **Direct and Concise:**  I'm keeping the message clear and concise, focusing on the price and a call to action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92.50 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100 and  a good compromise.  Given that Bob has already rejected two offers, I don't want to risk him walking away completely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
