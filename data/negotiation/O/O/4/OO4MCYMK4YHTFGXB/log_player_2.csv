# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value of the product to you and my original asking price. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,250. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $10,250, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the $10,000 price point, fulfilling the primary goal of getting the product at the best possible price."
