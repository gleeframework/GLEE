"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's something you value at $8,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's less than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
