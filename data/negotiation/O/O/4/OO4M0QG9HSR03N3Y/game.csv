"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  While it's worth a significant amount to me, I'm confident its value to you will be substantial as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm flexible. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still represents a good value for you, and allows us to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,,
