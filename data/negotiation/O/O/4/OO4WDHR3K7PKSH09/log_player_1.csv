Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable and I know you'll benefit greatly from it.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its value."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have a strong position. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob aims to justify the high price and create a sense of desire.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in your offer can make Bob more likely to take it seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your approach accordingly. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be preferable."
