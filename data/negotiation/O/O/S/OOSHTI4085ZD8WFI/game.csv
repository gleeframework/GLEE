"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $14,000 on it. Considering my budget and the current market value, I propose a counteroffer of $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our discussion.",12500.0,Bob,4,
