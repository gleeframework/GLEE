"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,150,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,225,000?  This is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be closer to your original asking price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,187,500.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,187,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to push for a price closer to $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,187,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but  I can't go lower than $1,206,250.
