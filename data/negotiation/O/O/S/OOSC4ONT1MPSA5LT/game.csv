"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price,  $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a revised price of $11,000. This remains a competitive offer given the product's value to you and I hope it aligns better with your budget.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After reviewing our conversation, I believe we can find common ground. I am willing to finalize the deal at $10,800. This is a fair compromise, considering both the product's value to you and the price you're comfortable with. I hope this proposal works for you.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your flexibility.  $10,800 is getting closer, but I'm still just a little over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's my final offer.  If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",10200.0,Bob,6,
