"Alice, thanks for the offer. I do see the value in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally honest, my absolute top price is $1,450,000.  If you're willing to come down just a bit more, I think we can make a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you've reached your top price, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,550,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
