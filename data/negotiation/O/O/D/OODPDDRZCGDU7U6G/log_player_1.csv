"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in paying a bit more for the product, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will find this price more acceptable, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John for $80 and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. I'll accept this offer to ensure a sale."
