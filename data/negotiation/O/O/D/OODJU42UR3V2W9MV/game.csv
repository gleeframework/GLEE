"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product, $2000000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. This is still a significant investment, and I believe it's fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still committed to your initial offer of $800000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
