# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product, $2000000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. This is still a significant investment, and I believe it's fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product.
