Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. I believe this product would be highly valuable to your business, and this price reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my original price reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he is unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum. Accepting his current offer of $875,000 would mean losing out on a potential $125,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, making it the most logical and profitable decision."
