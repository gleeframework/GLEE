,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider your product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12000. Would you be open to negotiating?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $12000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This takes into account your interest and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $12750?  I'm really interested in your product and believe this price is fair for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
