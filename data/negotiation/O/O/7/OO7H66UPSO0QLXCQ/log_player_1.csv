I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer once again.  While $8,700 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm going to try one more time to see if I can push Bob a bit higher. If he doesn't budge, I might have to consider selling to John."
