Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also a large enough amount to potentially entice Bob, but not so high that it immediately makes him walk away. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  By starting high, we aim for the maximum possible profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  We have space to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Security Net:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John gives us confidence to hold firm if Bob's offers are too low. 

**Next Steps:**

We'll need to analyze Bob's response and adapt our strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to our minimum value, but it's still lower than our initial offer. This means we have some leverage to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows us to send a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable agreement. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's, we still believe we can get a higher price, possibly closer to our initial asking price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that we are not desperate to sell and that we are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 

**Next Steps:**

We will need to consider how much we're willing to compromise and craft a counteroffer that is attractive to Bob while still maximizing our profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between our initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:** By lowering the price, we show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiations. 
* **Attractive but Firm:**  The offer is high enough to be enticing for Bob, but it still represents a significant profit for us.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  This counteroffer helps us avoid the risk of  Bob's counteroffers decreasing further, potentially forcing us to accept a much lower price.

**Next Steps:**

We'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and determine our next steps. If he accepts, we have secured a good deal. If he rejects, we'll need to assess whether to lower our price again or sell to John to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than our initial asking price and our counteroffer, it's closer to our minimum value and represents a significant profit. It's also a good compromise, considering Bob's previous rejection.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with John's lower offer. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit that is significantly higher than our minimum requirement.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might drag on, potentially leading to a lower offer or a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

We have successfully negotiated a sale with Bob.  It's important to finalize the details and close the deal to secure the profit."
