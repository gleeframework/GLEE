"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product at a price of $95. It's a real steal, considering its value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $100, I want to start the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for bargaining.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering $70 is still a reasonable markup from Alice's perceived value of $80, making it more likely she'll consider the offer without being offended. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give us an idea of Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $70 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $85 is better than her initial offer, it's still above our target price. Alice moving towards a compromise suggests she's open to further negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no rush to accept a price higher than we're comfortable with. 
* **John as Backup:** We always have the option to buy from John at $100 if the negotiations with Alice don't go our way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  Moving from $70 to $75 shows willingness to compromise but in smaller increments, signaling I'm looking for the best possible deal.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  Suggesting $75 is ""fair for both of us"" emphasizes that I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, not just trying to lowball her.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price below Alice's $80 value, increasing the chances of her accepting while still leaving some room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle for $80?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice explicitly stated this is her final offer. Her tone suggests she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Meeting Her Value:** $80 is the product's worth to Alice, meaning she's not making a profit at this price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. 
* **Saving Money:**  We're still getting the product for $20 less than John's offer, which is a significant saving.

It's always tempting to try and negotiate further, but in this case, accepting Alice's offer ensures we get the product at a great price."
