Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105 again, but this time, I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the bonus feature might not be worth exactly $10 to me, getting the price down to what is essentially $95 with the added benefit makes this a good deal. I'm close enough to my target price that it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely."
