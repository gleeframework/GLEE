"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $10,000.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,350?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",9350.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might be at an impasse. I really value your interest, but I need to be closer to $9,500 for this to work for me. If you're really serious about buying, let's meet at $9,400.  It's my final offer.",9400.0,Alice,7,
