"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $100 is still a bit too high for me, though.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? That's a fair price for both of us. ",95.0,Bob,4,
