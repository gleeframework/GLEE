{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's potential value for the product.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my ideal range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $875,000.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. I believe this price is still fair considering the product's value to him, and it gives him some room to negotiate while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get closer to $900,000, Bob has shown a firm stance at $850,000. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price.  $850,000 is a solid deal and I'm willing to accept it."
