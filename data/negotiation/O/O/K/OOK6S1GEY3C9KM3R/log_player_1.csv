Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. I'm not quite ready to settle for $105, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $109?  This is my final offer before I consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, I only have 4 rounds left before I'm forced to sell to John for $100.  $107 is a better deal than selling to John, and I'm confident I won't get a higher offer from Bob."
