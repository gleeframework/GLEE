"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $109?  This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",107.0,Bob,6,
