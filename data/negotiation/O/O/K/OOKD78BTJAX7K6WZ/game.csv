"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
