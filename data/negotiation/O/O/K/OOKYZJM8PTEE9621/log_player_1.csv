Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make."
