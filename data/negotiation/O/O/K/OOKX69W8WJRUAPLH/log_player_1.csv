Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $15,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $20,000. This product will truly be a game-changer for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $18,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $18,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  There's room to negotiate further with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $17,500 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving slowly, and while $17,500 is tempting, I still think I can get closer to $18,000. I'm willing to push a little further, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to make a deal. How about we split the difference - $18,500 and we have a deal? This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 18500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  At this point, stating this is my final offer adds a bit of pressure and emphasizes I'm serious about closing the deal.  $18,500 is a strong price, and by framing it as my last concession, it might encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to reach a deal. I would like to counter with an offer of $18,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has come up to $18,000, which is a reasonable compromise and close to my target price. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling completely.  While I could push for $18,500, it's not worth jeopardizing the deal at this stage."
