Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even more than this offer price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). While this might seem risky, it aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects it, he might be more open to a slightly lower counteroffer that's still above his initial valuation.
* **Below John's Offer:** This strategy ensures that if Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out on any potential profit. You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on a single round of negotiation. In reality, there might be multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers."
