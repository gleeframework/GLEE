"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $900,000 is still above your limit, so it makes sense to counteroffer."

While $875,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price of $800,000."
