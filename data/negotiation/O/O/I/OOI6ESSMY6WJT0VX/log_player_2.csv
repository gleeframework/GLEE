"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80

Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for $100, saving $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
