Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you at $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have a strong baseline. Aiming higher than $12,000 allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he manages to negotiate a lower price (e.g., $13,500), you'll still make more than selling to John directly.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified. This might make Bob more receptive, even if the price is higher than his perceived value.

**Important:** It's unlikely Bob will accept $15,000 knowing his valuation is $8,000. However, this strategy opens the door for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to your desired outcome."
