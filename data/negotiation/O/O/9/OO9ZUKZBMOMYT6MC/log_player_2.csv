"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm asking for $11,500 for, but I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her $10,000 valuation. This gives you the potential to save even more money."
