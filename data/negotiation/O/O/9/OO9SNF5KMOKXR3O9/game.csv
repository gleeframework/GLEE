,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. How about $7500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $8000?  That's a fair price considering the value to me, and it would allow us to close the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 was a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $8000. I'm willing to meet you at $8200. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a little higher than I can go.  How about we split the difference at $8100?  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget and you to get a fair price.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8100 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8050. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8050.0,Alice,7,
