"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value of the product to you and still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
