"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's  your minimum and  close to my maximum. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $925,000 is still above what I can afford. Let's split the difference and settle on $862,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and allows us to finally close this deal.",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $862,500. I'm thinking that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to push for a better price. I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price, so I'll offer it to you for $875,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $875,000. I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  If we can agree on this, I'm ready to close the deal today.",850000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $875,000, so I'll offer it to you for $862,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to call it a day at this price.",862500.0,Alice,9,
