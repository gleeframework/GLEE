"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be a great investment for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,075,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and I'm confident I can make this product work for me.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
