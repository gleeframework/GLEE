Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $650,000. This is a significant savings from John's price of $1,200,000 and a reasonable compromise.  While there's a chance Alice might go lower, continuing to negotiate risks her pulling out of the deal altogether."
