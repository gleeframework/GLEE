"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is strong, I'm still confident the product's inherent value justifies a higher price. To move us closer to a deal, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's exceptional potential.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This feels like a good middle ground that acknowledges both the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

This is a significant investment on your end, but I truly believe it's one with an exceptional return given the product's potential.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,300,000. This price is a fair compromise that recognizes both the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
