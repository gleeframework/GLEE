"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my minimum ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I leave the door open for counteroffers, signaling I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can't afford that price. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Although Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has expressed interest in the product.  I can still try to negotiate a better price in subsequent rounds. 
* **John's offer:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. There are 8 rounds left, which is enough time to try and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,200,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm reiterating that this is a good deal for Bob and that he's getting a significant discount. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage further discussion and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still too low.  I have four rounds left to try and reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer:** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000 now, I believe there's still a good chance of getting a better price from Bob. There are more rounds left and I'm seeing signs of his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.  However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing this offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using a more direct approach, asking Bob for a decision to encourage a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Would you be willing to go down to $950000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would still result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** There are four rounds remaining. Bob is showing signs of increasing his offer, so I believe there's a chance to get closer to my target price.
* **John's offer:**  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000 now, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  The negotiation seems to be moving in a positive direction, and I want to see if I can close the deal with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,000,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.  It's a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise again, moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but staying above my minimum. 
* **Win-Win Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, highlighting that this offer is a ""win-win.""
* **Direct Question:** I'm using a direct question to encourage a decision from Bob and move the negotiation forward.

**Important Note:**  If Bob continues to reject my offers and stays below my minimum acceptable price, I will need to consider selling to John in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not there yet.  $1000000 is a good offer, but I can only go up to $975000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to our last two rounds.  If I reject Bob's offer, he may not increase it significantly in the final round.
* **Still below minimum:**  $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, avoiding the risk of Bob's potential rejection in the final round.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 is too high at this stage."
