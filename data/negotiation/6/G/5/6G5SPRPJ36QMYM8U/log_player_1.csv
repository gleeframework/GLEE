Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $110. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Bob will go above $110. It's better to cut losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
