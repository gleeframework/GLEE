"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price. While Alice claims it's a discount, you have no information to verify that.  Since you can get the product from John for the same price, you're better off rejecting Alice's offer to potentially get a better deal later."
