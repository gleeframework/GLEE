,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $2,250,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This revised offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our mutual interests.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
