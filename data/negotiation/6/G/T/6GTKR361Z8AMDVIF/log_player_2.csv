"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do much better than $900,000.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a good deal.  He knows Alice wants to sell for at least $800,000.  Offering $750,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, while still leaving some room for negotiation. This initial counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to be assertive about getting a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still get a better deal. He knows Alice is willing to sell for less than $850,000, so rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows him to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows Alice values the product at $800,000.  Offering this amount directly shows Bob is serious about buying, but also pushes Alice to consider his offer closely. Since Alice is motivated to sell, she may be willing to accept this price to avoid further negotiation."
