Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $14,500. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($14,500) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It signals the product's value while still offering him a potential ""deal.""
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly might be slightly more desirable than waiting for John, even if the price difference is small. 

This approach aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
