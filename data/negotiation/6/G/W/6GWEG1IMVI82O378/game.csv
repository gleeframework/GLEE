"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is significantly below the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. ",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?  I believe that's a fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $800,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
