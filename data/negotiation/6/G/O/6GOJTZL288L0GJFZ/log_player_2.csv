{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Testing the waters:** This round is about gauging Alice's willingness to compromise. If she accepts, you've secured a good deal. If she rejects, you'll learn how far she's willing to go. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** With 8 rounds remaining, you still have plenty of time to make further counteroffers if necessary."
