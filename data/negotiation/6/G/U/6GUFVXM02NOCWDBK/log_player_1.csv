{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will counter-offer, allowing me to explore a potential win-win scenario. If Bob rejects, I can always go with John's offer for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is too low.  It's significantly below my minimum threshold of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get more than $100, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is too far below what I need for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $135?  This would give you a good price while still letting me cover my costs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $120. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy it now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is still below my minimum threshold of $150. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I will sell the product to him."
