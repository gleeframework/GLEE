"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is too far below what I need for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $135?  This would give you a good price while still letting me cover my costs.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $120. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy it now.",120.0,Bob,4,
