"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This would still be a great deal for you and a good starting point for us to work with. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
