"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I'm selling for $12,000. I know it's worth more to you, but this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you know Alice is valuing the product significantly lower. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price by rejecting this initial offer."
