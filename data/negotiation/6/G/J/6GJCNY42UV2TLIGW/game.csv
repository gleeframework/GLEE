"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given your own valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still beyond what I can afford. Let's split the difference and I'll pay $10,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to find a price that works for us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
