Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price than $7,500. I can always fall back to selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800

While $7,800 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum.  John is a sure thing for $8,000, so I'm going to take that deal."
