"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $1,900,000 is a substantial gap from the product's true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a significant difference from what I believe the product is worth. Let's settle this at $1,400,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its value.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
