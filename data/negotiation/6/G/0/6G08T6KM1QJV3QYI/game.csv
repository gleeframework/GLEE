"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
