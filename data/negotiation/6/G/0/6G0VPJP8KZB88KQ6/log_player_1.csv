Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to the product's value to me ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below that will be instantly accepted. I need to aim higher.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John. This means I shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for me. 

**The Message:**

The message is crafted to be:

* **Enticing:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""valuable asset.""
* **Time-Sensitive:**  Adding a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer.""
* **Respectful:**  Avoiding any hard-selling tactics and encouraging thoughtful consideration."
