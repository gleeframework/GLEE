Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This allows for some wiggle room for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle at $10250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.

Round 7

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a final counteroffer to Alice. I'm trying to get as close to my target price as possible, so I'll offer $9,800 again, but this time I'll add a bit of a twist. I'll also throw in a condition that if she accepts, I'll also ask her to throw in some free maintenance and support for the product, which I think is worth at least $200.
