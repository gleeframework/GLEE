Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We start by aiming high to maximize potential profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, any amount above that is pure gain.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By positioning the offer as ""fair"" and emphasizing the value to Bob, you increase the chances of him accepting without further negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects it, you might consider a slightly lower counter-offer before resorting to your guaranteed sale with John."
