Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to be at $9500 to make it work. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I think there's room for further negotiation.  If we don't reach an agreement, I'll be happy to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point.  While I'm eager to make a deal with you,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to another buyer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10000, but I'm still hoping to save a bit more. How about we meet at $9750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it seems like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident he'll pay me fairly."
