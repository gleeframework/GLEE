"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to be at $9500 to make it work. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point.  While I'm eager to make a deal with you,  $9500 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to another buyer.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10000, but I'm still hoping to save a bit more. How about we meet at $9750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9750.0,Bob,6,
