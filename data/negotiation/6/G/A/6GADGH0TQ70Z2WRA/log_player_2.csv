Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to be at $9,500 to make it work. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point.  While I'm eager to make a deal with you,  $9500 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to another buyer.  Let me know what you think.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still hoping to save a bit more. How about we meet at $9,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}"
