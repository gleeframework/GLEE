,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the mark, the value this product brings is truly exceptional.  Could we settle on $1,700,000? This feels like a fair reflection of its worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,700,000. I'd like to make a lower offer of $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
