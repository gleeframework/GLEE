"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,500,000 is a substantial amount, but it's also not unreasonable for a product potentially worth millions.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me an idea of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired starting point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to increase the price. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be less than my desired outcome. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:**  I'm dropping my price by $100,000, showing flexibility, but not giving away too much.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Margin:** $1,400,000 still puts me comfortably above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $1,300,000 is very close to my last counteroffer and is only $100,000 less than my initial asking price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll make a lower counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Securing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be less profitable."
