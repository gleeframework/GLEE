Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer is slightly below what John is willing to pay, but it leaves some room for negotiation and is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000. This strategy aims to maximize the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good price for you."
