"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting Alice's offer allows for more rounds of negotiation to try and reach a price closer to $10,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $10,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10,900. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is still above Bob's budget and  too close to his maximum price point. Given that Bob is willing to pay $10,000 for the product from John, continuing to negotiate with Alice would only risk getting stuck at a price higher than he wants. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and guarantee the product at his desired price point."
