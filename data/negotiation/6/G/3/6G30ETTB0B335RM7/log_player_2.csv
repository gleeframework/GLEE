{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still above your maximum of $100. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise.  It's important to start strong, and show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating a good price."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $85 is still above my maximum price. While it's closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. There's still a good chance we can find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $70. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, while still staying within my price limit. I believe this is a fair offer that Alice might be willing to accept, considering she's already reduced her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to accept it. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. It's important to be persistent and not give in too easily."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $75. This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still not going above my maximum price. With only four rounds left, I'm hoping this will be a reasonable offer for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, Alice's offer of $95 is still above my maximum price of $100.  It's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring I get the product while staying within my budget."
