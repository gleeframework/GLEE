"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about $11,500? That's a fair offer, considering I can get it for $12,000 elsewhere.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,000. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
