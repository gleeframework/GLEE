Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John,  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway from $85, but I'm still not willing to go up to $90. How about $87.50?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87.50 is getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a little bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to pay a fair price, but I'm not comfortable with $88.50. How about $86? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although I'm running out of rounds, I'm still not comfortable selling for $86. I'll try to get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $86 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal at $87.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally put this negotiation to rest."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $87. How about $85.25? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. With only two rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.  While I'd prefer to get more, $80 is a reasonable price and it ensures I don't risk losing out completely."
