"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's so far below my bottom line.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, while still being closer to my desired price.  I believe this offer is fair and leaves room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000.  This price is a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob and that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation and I don't want to risk a further drop in price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed sale and it meets my minimum acceptable price."
