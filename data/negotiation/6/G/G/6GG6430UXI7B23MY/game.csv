"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the  $1,200,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both of our positions.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  To be frank, though, $1,800,000 is still below what I consider a fair deal for this product. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'll propose $1,950,000.  This is a significant move on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
