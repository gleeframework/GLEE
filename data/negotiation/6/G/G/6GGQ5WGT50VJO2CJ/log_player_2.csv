"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued to me at over $800000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you. Are you interested in discussing a potential purchase at $900000?  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This means there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer.  Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or see if there are other sellers offering better deals."
