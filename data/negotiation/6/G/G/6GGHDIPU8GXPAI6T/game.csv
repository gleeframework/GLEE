"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique item like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you halfway at $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $18000? This is still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $14000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $16000? This is still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $16000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll counter with $13500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",13500.0,Bob,6,
