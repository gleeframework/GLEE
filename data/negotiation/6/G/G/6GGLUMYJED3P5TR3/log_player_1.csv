Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price of $150 for the product. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 150}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer is $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $120."
