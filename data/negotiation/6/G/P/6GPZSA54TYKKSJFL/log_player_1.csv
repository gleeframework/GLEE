Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Potential Profit:**  A starting price of $18,000 gives you the potential to make a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and implying it's a good deal, which might encourage Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, your knowledge of his negotiation style, and the specific product could influence your approach."
