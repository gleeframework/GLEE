"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Since your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value, and it allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $900,000 to $875,000, which is a significant reduction.  This price is still within your budget and represents a good savings compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a favorable price."
