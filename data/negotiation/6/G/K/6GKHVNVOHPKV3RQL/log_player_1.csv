"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know Bob values the product at $800,000, but he has to understand my minimum value is $1,500,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I need to achieve my goal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired profit.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of time,  $1,100,000 is still too far below my minimum.  It's unlikely Bob will get much higher, but I need to see if I can push him further. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will signal that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but also that I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price.  While $1,150,000 is closer than before, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum value."
