"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal.  If not, you can always buy from John for $150."
