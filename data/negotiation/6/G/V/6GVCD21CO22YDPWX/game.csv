"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I think this is a fair starting point for something of this caliber.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
