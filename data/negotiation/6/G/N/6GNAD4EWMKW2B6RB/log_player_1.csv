"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts before making further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $50 is well below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject this offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This is a fair offer, and hopefully Bob will accept it.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $70 is still too low. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his offers are not coming close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate, hoping for a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking this deal.  If he rejects it, I'm getting closer to selling to John, and I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll reject this offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm lowering my price to $90, which is a significant compromise on my part.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the game, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price.  I will sell to John for $120."
