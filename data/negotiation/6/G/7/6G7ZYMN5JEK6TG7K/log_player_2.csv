Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500.

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and while another round *might* get it down to $10,500, it's not guaranteed. Accepting the $11,000 offer secures a reasonable price for the product and avoids the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
