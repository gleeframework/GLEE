"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and in excellent condition.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I agree the product is good, $14,000 is still above my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $12,000? I'm confident you won't find a better deal on this.",12000.0,Alice,5,
