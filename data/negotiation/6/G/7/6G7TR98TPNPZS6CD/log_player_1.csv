Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation increases your potential profit.

By starting at $120, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
