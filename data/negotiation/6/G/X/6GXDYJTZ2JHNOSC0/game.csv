"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $110?",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've got to make a living. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $115?",115.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the price I could get from John. I'm willing to meet you at $115 again, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",115.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,120.0
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $115. I'm willing to make one last offer to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $119?",119.0,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $115, and you've made it clear that you're not willing to go below $119. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $150. Can we wrap things up here?",115.0,Bob,10,,
