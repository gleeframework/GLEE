"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product.  I'm willing to offer $950000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1050000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still aiming for a more agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential savings for both of us. Let's reach a deal that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
