"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $92.50? This would give us both a fair deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.5 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. ",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $88 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $90.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a little too much for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget, so I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $88.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",88.0,Bob,6,
