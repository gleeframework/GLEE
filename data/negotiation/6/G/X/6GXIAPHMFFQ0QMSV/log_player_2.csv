The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $150. This is a terrible deal for you.  Rejecting the offer is the best option to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, she'll realize that this is a good deal for her, even though it's less than what the product is worth to her."

While $130 is closer to my limit, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable paying, and we only have a few rounds left.  It's getting risky to continue negotiating, and I don't want to miss out on the guaranteed price from John."
