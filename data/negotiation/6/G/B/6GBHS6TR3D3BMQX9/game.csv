,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit steep for me. How about $140? I'm sure we can find common ground.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make at least $160 to break even. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $155. That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $165 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $165?",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160.  This is my final offer.",160.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $165, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free accessory with the product if you're willing to meet me at $165?",165.0,Alice,7,
