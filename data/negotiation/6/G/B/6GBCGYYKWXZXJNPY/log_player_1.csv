Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The message ends by inviting Bob's thoughts, leaving space for potential negotiation if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer. If Bob negotiates down, you can still likely secure a price higher than $1,200,000."
