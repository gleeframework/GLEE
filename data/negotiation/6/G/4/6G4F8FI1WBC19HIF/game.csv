"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8500? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go down to $8500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9250?  This still allows me to make a fair profit, and hopefully, it's a price you can work with.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $8750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
