"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,400, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to get this done.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $10,200 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,300, but that's my final offer.  If you're serious about buying this product, I need you to meet me at this price. ",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",10250.0,Bob,8,
