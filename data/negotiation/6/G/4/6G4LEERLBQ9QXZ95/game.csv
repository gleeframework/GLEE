"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing this further.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I've placed on it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can guarantee a swift and smooth transaction.  Does that work for you?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to consider my offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the guarantee you're asking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,280,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I've placed on it.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
