Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but it also shows that I value the product highly and am not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's still lower than I'd like, it's getting closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to accept his offer of $1,600,000 as it's a good compromise and avoids further negotiation."
