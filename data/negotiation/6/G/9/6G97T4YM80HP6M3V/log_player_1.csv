Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, but allows for room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's important to keep in mind that I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, as stated in the prompt."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $100. I will counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make this compromise."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $95.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is still less than my ideal price, it's above my minimum of $100. I'd rather sell to Bob than to John, and I'm happy to close the deal."
