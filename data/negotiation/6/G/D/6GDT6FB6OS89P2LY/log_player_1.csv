"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  Given its value, I'm setting the initial price at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly high price to establish a strong bargaining position. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" without revealing specific details that Bob could use against me.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm aware I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. This knowledge empowers me to be bold in my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately went to his absolute maximum. While I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 with John, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal from Bob. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I recognize your perspective on the value, my initial offer reflects the significant potential this product holds.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial reduction of $200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Holding Firm:**  The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and my minimum. This keeps the door open for a profitable outcome.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the product's potential, subtly justifying the higher price without being too revealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still sticking to my original offer of $1,000,000.  This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering my own needs.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his maximum price, but I'm not convinced he's unwilling to budge at all. I still have negotiating room and time on my side. By continuing to counter, I might be able to incentivize him to move from his $1,000,000 position. I'll make another offer in the next round, strategically placing it to encourage movement from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant move on my end, reflecting my desire to reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calculated Concession:** I've made another substantial drop of $150,000, but not so much that it undermines my position or suggests desperation. This price is still comfortably above both my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to ""bridge the gap"" and make this deal work. By stating it's a ""significant move,"" I aim to signal that further concessions might be smaller.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While I'm showing flexibility, I haven't drastically lowered the price. This maintains pressure on Bob to counter and potentially move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on my offer of $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical moment. Bob is playing hardball, presenting his offer as a ""final"" one and introducing the threat of walking away. However, I've consistently made concessions, and he hasn't budged. There's a chance this is a tactic to get me to settle for his initial price. 

I'll call his bluff. I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 with John, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get him to move from his position.  There are still a few rounds left, and my next counteroffer will be crucial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I also know the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,250,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise given its potential. Let me know if you're willing to make this deal happen."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By framing this as my ""final offer"" and ""bottom line,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that this is the last chance to make a deal.
* **Strategic Position:** $1,250,000 is still significantly above my guaranteed price with John, but it's a substantial concession from my previous offer. This price point aims to balance potential profit with the risk of losing the deal.
* **Direct Appeal:** I'm directly asking Bob if he's ""willing to make this deal happen,"" putting the decision back in his court and subtly applying pressure.

This offer represents a calculated risk. If Bob walks away, I'll accept John's offer. However, there's a possibility that by holding firm and presenting a final, reasonable compromise, Bob will agree to a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and represents my absolute maximum. I believe this price is fair given the product's value to me. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally moved from his $1,000,000 stance, offering $1,100,000. This is a significant breakthrough. While I presented $1,250,000 as my ""final offer,"" his willingness to budge suggests a deal can be made.

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,100,000 is a $100,000 profit over my guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There are only two rounds left. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob withdrawing, leaving me with John's offer as the fallback.
* **Limited Upside:** While there's a slight chance Bob might go higher, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,250,000. The potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing the current offer.

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,100,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
