Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it potentially attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

I'm countering with $12,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer and leaving a bit of room for negotiation. It also keeps the price above my minimum while showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12400}
```

I'm countering with $12,400.  This is a smaller step down than the previous round, showing that I'm getting close to my limit but not giving in completely. It also leaves room for a potential final negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price of $10,000. While I might have been able to get a few hundred dollars more, the risk of further negotiation is high. It's likely Bob won't budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
