Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate further. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,080,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we are getting closer, I believe there is still room for negotiation.  I'm committed to getting as close to my desired price as possible before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,070,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $1,065,000 for the product.  This price is a good compromise and reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that this deal can be mutually beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired range and is still a better deal than selling to John.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly higher offer, so it's time to close the deal."
