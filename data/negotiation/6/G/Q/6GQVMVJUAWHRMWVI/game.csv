"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still think $1,325,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $1,275,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,275,000 is close, but I need to be a little closer to my target. Would you consider $1,300,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. How about we meet at $1,280,000? I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
