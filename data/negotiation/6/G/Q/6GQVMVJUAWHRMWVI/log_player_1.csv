While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,280,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:**  This price still provides a healthy profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to frustration or Bob walking away altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to reinvest the money sooner and potentially generate further returns.

Overall, accepting $1,280,000 represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a favorable outcome with a reasonable degree of certainty."
