Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move that establishes a high baseline for the negotiation.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still keeps the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $920,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and allows me to secure a sale. Further negotiation might take longer and risk losing the deal entirely."
