Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting very close.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,125.  This is my final offer, and if we don't reach an agreement, I'll need to move on.  Think carefully about this â€“ it's a good deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go below $10,000. Her language suggests this is her ""final offer"" and she may be less willing to negotiate further. It's not worth the risk of her walking away and potentially losing the product altogether.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
