Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is well above your $1,200,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's estimated value:** $1,450,000 is still less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making the deal potentially attractive to him.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while also leaving space for potential counteroffers and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. You want to see if you can push him closer to your desired price point.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, considering your interest in the product.  This price is still fair and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,375,000.  This would allow us both to secure a fair deal. Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is a good compromise. It's:

* **Above your minimum:** This ensures you're getting a price higher than your bottom line.
* **Close to your initial counteroffer:** It's only $25,000 lower than your previous offer, indicating a potential for a final deal.
* **Likely close to Bob's maximum:**  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, making this a reasonable final offer.

Accepting the offer ensures a successful deal and maximizes your profit compared to selling to John.  While further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and the time investment make this a sensible choice."
