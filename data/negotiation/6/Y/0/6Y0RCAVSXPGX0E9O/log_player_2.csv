"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, you can potentially save even more by negotiating with Alice. You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000. This gives you room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within your budget. It signals your seriousness in buying the product while leaving room for further negotiation.  You're hoping Alice will see the value in selling the product to you rather than losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer. It's also close to my maximum willingness to pay. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price."
