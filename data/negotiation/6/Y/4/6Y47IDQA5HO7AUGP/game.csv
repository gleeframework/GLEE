"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, recognizing your need for a good deal.  This price still allows me to meet my own goals, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's try $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to find a middle ground. I understand your budget, but $1,250,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This is my final offer. It's a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options. Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm hoping we can do even better than that. I'm starting to get concerned that we might be at an impasse. Can we really get to a price that works for both of us?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
