"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive, emphasizing the opportunity and value to Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $1,750,000 price allows for some give-and-take without jeopardizing my minimum desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum desired outcome of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 8 rounds left to potentially reach a better agreement with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** However, selling to John at $1,500,000 is a guarantee of meeting my minimum.  I'll keep this option in mind but will continue to negotiate with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, recognizing your need for a good deal.  This price still allows me to meet my own goals, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints and express understanding. 
* **Compromising, But Firm:** I counter with $1,400,000, which is a compromise, but still maintains a significant profit for me.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value, hoping to incentivize him to meet me halfway. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys willingness to negotiate, but also shows I'm not desperate."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's try $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a smaller decrease this time, showing I'm serious about a deal but not willing to give away too much.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

* **Time is running out:** I only have 4 rounds left to reach an agreement with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is becoming more attractive:**  While I would prefer to get a higher price from Bob, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum. I'll need to be more strategic in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to find a middle ground. I understand your budget, but $1,250,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This is my final offer. It's a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

* **Significant Compromise:** I'm reducing my offer by $25,000 from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Clear Deadline:** I set a clear deadline by stating that I will explore other options if we can't agree. This adds pressure for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** While this is my final offer, the message leaves the door open for Bob to propose a counteroffer if they are still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm hoping we can do even better than that. I'm starting to get concerned that we might be at an impasse. Can we really get to a price that works for both of us?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** I have only 2 rounds left to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum desired outcome of $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum:**  Since Bob is not willing to meet my minimum, it's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit at my minimum price."
