"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable asset that I believe will be of significant benefit to you. I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a price that reflects its worth.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This price is fair and allows you to acquire the product at a substantial savings compared to its intrinsic value.  Please consider this offer carefully. I am confident that you will find this acquisition to be a wise investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000), it's within your acceptable range and a better deal than buying from John."
