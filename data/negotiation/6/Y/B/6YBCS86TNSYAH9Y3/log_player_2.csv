"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. Would you be interested in purchasing it from me for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Compromise is reached:** Alice has lowered her price, and Bob is getting a better deal than her initial offer.
* **Value for money:** While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
