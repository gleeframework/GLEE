Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob to explore his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,500,000 price provides room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, I can gauge his seriousness and adjust accordingly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to create a sense of its importance and potential benefit to him.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob outright rejects the initial high price without countering, I might miss the opportunity to sell it for more than $1,000,000. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price justifies the calculated risk."
