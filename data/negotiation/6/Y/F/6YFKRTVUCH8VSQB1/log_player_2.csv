Thank you for considering our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000. Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000. However, you can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll lower her price."
