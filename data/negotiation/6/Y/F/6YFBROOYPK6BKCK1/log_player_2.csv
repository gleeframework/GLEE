"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,050,000. It's a steal at this price considering its true value. I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire to get a good deal. However, $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is still a great price for a product you value at the same amount.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is exactly Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and there's a risk that she'll reject a lower counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John at the same price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to ensure Bob gets the product at the lowest possible price."
