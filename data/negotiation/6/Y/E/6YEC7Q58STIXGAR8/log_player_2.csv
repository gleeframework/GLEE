# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $80 by me. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it would be worth your investment. Let's discuss how we can make this deal work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is below your maximum price of $100, so accepting the offer is the best option. This saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
