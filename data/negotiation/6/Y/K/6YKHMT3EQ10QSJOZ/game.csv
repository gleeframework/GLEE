"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Bob,4,
