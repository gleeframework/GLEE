"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to lower the price by counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is your fallback option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates your serious intent to buy but also sets a strong starting point for negotiations.
* **Below Alice's value:**  $950,000 is still above Alice's desired price of $1,000,000, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **There's potential for further negotiation.**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **John's offer is my fallback option.**  If I can't get a better price from Alice, I'm comfortable buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's previous offer. It shows I'm serious about a deal, but also pushing for the best possible price.
* **At Alice's value:**  This offer is exactly at Alice's desired price, giving her no incentive to reject it. 
* **Final offer (almost):**  If Alice rejects this, I'll have to consider John's offer, as there might not be much more room for compromise."
