"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, you can still do better.  You know the product is worth $10,000 to you, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer and your maximum price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a deal that benefits you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is close to your maximum price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. Since you're only willing to spend up to $10,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
