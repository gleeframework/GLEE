Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit for Alice ($100,000 over John's offer) and still represents a good deal for Bob, saving him $100,000 compared to its value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
