"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  It's significantly lower than what I could get from someone else, and it still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know your decision, but remember, if you pass, I have another buyer lined up.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
