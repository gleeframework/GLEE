"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, which means you won't save any money. Since John is also offering the product for the same price, there's no advantage in buying from Alice. You might as well buy from John."
