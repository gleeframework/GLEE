"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $80.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95.  If we can reach an agreement at that price, it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still higher than my maximum budget of $80. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed option and buy the product from John for $80."
