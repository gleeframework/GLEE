"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95.  If we can reach an agreement at that price, it would be a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
