"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit below what I can consider. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Could you do $950,000?  That would work for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pretty big gap between our positions here. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be frank, I have another buyer who's ready to pay $1,200,000.  I'd rather close this deal with you, but I need you to get closer to that number. Would you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
