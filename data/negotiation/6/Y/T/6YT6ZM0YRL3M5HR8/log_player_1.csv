Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits you'll reap from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to maximize our profit without being too greedy and risking a rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than John's $800,000 offer. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and presents the price confidently as a fair deal."
