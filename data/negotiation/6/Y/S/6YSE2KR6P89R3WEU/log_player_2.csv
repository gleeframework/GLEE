"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  
* There's no reason to buy from John immediately, as you have 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is a strong opening counteroffer.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but not so low as to be insulting.
* This shows that Bob is serious about buying but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. 
*  The goal is to save as much as possible, and continuing to negotiate could yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for being flexible, Alice.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  This counteroffer continues to move towards Alice's price but shows Bob is still willing to negotiate.
*  It's a smaller step than the previous counteroffer, suggesting Bob is getting closer to his final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $11,250. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now within $250 of Bob's ideal price. 
* Accepting the offer at this point secures the product for a good price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better deal.
* It's always a risk to keep negotiating, especially as Bob has a fallback option with John."
