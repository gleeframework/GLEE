"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, and for me to potentially lower the price if needed. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I want to maximize my profit, I also want to be aware of John's offer of $120 and be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I can still potentially get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, so I can afford to be patient.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $110 is a fair price.
* **Staying above minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum price of $120, so I'm not losing money by making this offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's first counteroffer, but I'm showing flexibility to keep the negotiation moving."
