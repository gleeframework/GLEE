"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500, considering your interest in the product. Let's find a middle ground here!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to meet me in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $8,000, I'd be happy to make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
