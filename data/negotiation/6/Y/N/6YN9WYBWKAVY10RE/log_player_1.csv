"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm confident I can do better by continuing the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price of $9,500. Selling to John for $8,000 would be a safe option, but I'd rather try to maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500, considering your interest in the product. Let's find a middle ground here!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to meet me in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $8,000, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's unlikely he'll go any higher. Accepting his offer ensures I get the best possible deal within the limited rounds.  Selling to John at this point would give me the same price, but I'm more confident in closing the deal with Bob."
