Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about we aim for $1,200,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable investment without exceeding my budget.

Round 5

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John. It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing any more time with Bob. I can get a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, which is more than Bob's current offer and closer to my desired price."
