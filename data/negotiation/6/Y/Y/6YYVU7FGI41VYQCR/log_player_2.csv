You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down in price, especially since the product is worth $15,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $12,000.  This is a bold move, but since Alice is motivated to sell (the product is worth more to her than this price), there's a chance she'll accept. If she rejects, I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or just buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate, as she's clearly willing to move closer to my price point.  There's a good chance I can get her down to my target $12,000 with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $13,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. It's a compromise that could lead to a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $16,500 is still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can get her down to my target price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time only by $1,000. I'm showing Alice that I'm making a serious effort to meet her halfway.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to close the deal.  If not, I'll be ready to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still significantly higher than my target of $12,000.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like she's not willing to drop to a price that I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $12,000. This will save me a significant amount of money and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
