"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $150. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower Offer:**  Start by offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows you're serious about buying but also have a strict budget.
* **Reasoning:**  Provide a brief explanation to make your counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Leaving some room for negotiation allows for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $160? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $145? That's a fair middle ground, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase Offer:**  Increase your offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  Highlight the offer as a ""fair middle ground"" to appeal to Alice's sense of compromise.
* **Closing Statement:**  End with a phrase that suggests you're ready to finalize the deal, encouraging Alice to accept."
