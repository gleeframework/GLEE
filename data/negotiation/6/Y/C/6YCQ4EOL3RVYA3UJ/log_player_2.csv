Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $73. I'll meet you halfway between $72.50 and $71, so I'll sell the product to you for $71.75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $71.75. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $71.50. Accepting this offer gets me the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing completely."
