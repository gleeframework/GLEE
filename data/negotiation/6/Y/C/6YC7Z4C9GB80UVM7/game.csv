"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit closer to your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $13,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right about the product's value, and I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  How about we settle at $12,000 even?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,500. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
