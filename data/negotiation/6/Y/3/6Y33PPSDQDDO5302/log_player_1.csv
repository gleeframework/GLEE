Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to purchase it for $125. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.
