"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my initial estimation of the product's value, I'm open to finding a compromise. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
