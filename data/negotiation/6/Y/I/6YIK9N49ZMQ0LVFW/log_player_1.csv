Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find this price attractive enough to consider, but if not, I'm prepared to engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my counteroffer of $135 and is above my minimum of $100.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, avoiding further negotiation and the risk of Bob backing out or me needing to sell to John for a lower price."
