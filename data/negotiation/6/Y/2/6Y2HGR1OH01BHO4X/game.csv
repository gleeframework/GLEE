"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  Unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings.",8500.0,Alice,5,
