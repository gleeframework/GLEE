Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob won't accept immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to adjust if needed.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, which is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer more,  it's a good deal compared to selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
