"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This gives you a significant savings compared to your initial valuation, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
