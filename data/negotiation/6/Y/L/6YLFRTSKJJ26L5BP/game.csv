"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1150000 still feels a bit low for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $1200000? It's a fair price considering the potential value this product offers. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
