"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a good starting point to see how much he values the product.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,400,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a significant jump from Bob's offer, which may encourage him to come up a little.  Let's see how he reacts to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to be careful with time, $1,100,000 is too low.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,200,000, hoping that Bob is getting close to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds left, it's time to start pushing for a deal that benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's getting very close to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I still want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,200,000 and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer and very close to my minimum acceptable price. With only 3 rounds left, I'm pushing for a deal that is within my acceptable range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. Bob seems unwilling to come up to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal. It's better to secure a sale than to potentially get stuck with a lower price or no sale at all."
