"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's closer to what I had in mind, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
