Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500.  This is a great deal considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not drastically higher, allowing for a reasonable counteroffer from Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's potential benefits to Bob, making the price more palatable.

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer. If it's a reasonable offer, I'll consider accepting.  If the negotiations stall or I feel I'm not getting a good enough price, I'll move on to John, who is offering my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation. I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob without risking selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum. My goal is to meet somewhere in the middle, hopefully closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's closer to what I had in mind, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $11,500 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer but significantly lower than my starting price, signaling my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes how this price is a good deal for both of us, making the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response.  If he accepts, we've reached a deal. If he rejects, I'll assess the situation carefully. If his counteroffer is too low, I'll consider selling to John. If it's reasonable, I'll continue negotiating."
