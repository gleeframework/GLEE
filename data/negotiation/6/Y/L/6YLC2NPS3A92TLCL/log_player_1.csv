"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's not completely unreasonable.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too far below the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with this counteroffer.  This price is still a good profit for me, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I can get him to budge higher.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of more rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I'm happy with that outcome."
