,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want this product, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference from our last offers and call it $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer it to you for $12,750. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'll make one last offer: $13,000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $13,000 is too high.  I'm willing to pay $12,250, but that's my final offer. ",12250.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit.",12500.0,Alice,9,
