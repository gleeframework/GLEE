"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $15,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
