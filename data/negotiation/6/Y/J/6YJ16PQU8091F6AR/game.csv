"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while staying within my financial constraints.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
