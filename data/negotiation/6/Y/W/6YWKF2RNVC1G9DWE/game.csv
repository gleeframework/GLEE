"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and would greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I could do  $600,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to be more realistic about its value. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer a price of $900,000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margins. I hope this is something we can work with.",900000.0,Alice,5,
