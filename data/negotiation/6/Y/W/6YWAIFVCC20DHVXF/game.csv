"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to $6,000 to make this work.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $8,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but $8,000 is even lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $8,000, which is $10,000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to budge a bit. How about we settle at $8,500? That's the highest I can go.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
