I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed floor price of $1,000,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  A higher price means a higher potential profit for me.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, I'm confident I can still sell it to John for a substantial amount.

Let's see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product!"
