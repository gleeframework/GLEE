"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this deal. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  However, it's closer to my ideal price, so I'm going to try negotiating further to see if I can get it down to $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my budget of $10,000.  While I appreciate her willingness to compromise, I'm not comfortable going that high.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
