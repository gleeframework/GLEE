"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, though. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $90. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.  If not, I'll have to go with another seller.",90.0,Bob,4,
