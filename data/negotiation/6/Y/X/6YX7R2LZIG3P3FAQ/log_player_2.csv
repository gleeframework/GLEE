Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $16,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her asking price. She went up to $16,000 after initially offering $14,000.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly lower than $14,000, even with more rounds of negotiation. 

Since we have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more financial sense to take that guaranteed deal and save the extra money."
