"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800000 to me, and I believe it will be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $900000. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $812500. This price is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm not willing to go lower than $800000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable accepting, as it reflects the product's true value. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,7,
