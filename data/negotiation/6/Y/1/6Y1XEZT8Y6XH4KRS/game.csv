"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
