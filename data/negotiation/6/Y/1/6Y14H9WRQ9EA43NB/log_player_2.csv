"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $120 is still too high.  Bob can do better by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his maximum price of $80. He's also trying to build rapport by being polite and acknowledging Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price.  Bob is willing to pay no more than $80 for the product. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm firm at $90 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, moving closer to his maximum price but still leaving some room for compromise. He's using strong language like ""firm"" to show that he is serious about his counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 might still be a bit high, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still holding out for a better price.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum, he is still willing to reject it and continue negotiating.  He believes he can potentially secure a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $100 is still too high. I'm going to offer you $95, and I really hope we can settle this now. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but is also expressing a willingness to close the deal. He's offering $95, which is only $5 more than his maximum price. This strategy shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but still wants to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $98. It's a great price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let's meet in the middle again! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $98 is still higher than Bob's maximum of $80.  He's already made several counteroffers and feels he's reached the limit of his negotiating power. With limited rounds left, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $80.  This guarantees him the best price within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
