"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's not so high that it will immediately scare Bob off. I want to see if there's room for negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product, but still allow me to earn more than the $80 I would get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is the same as his previous offer.  I've already rejected it once, but with only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  I'd rather accept the $90 and secure the deal than risk getting stuck with the lower price from John."
