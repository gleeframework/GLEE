"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin discussions."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but your initial price is a bit high for me. How about we start at $900,000? It's a strong offer that reflects my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and the product's worth to him.  It's important to signal you're serious about a fair deal, but not desperate.  We'll aim higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it would make this a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but we're still significantly below our target.  We're getting closer to John's offer, so the pressure is on.  We need to hold firm to push Bob closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is undeniable, and $975,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Firmness:** We're nearing John's offer, so we need to project firmness to avoid getting lowballed.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Mentioning another buyer introduces a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Final Offer:**  This signals to Bob that significant movement on the price is unlikely in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product. It's a fair price that respects its value while working within my budget.  Let me know if we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation might push Bob away, especially since he knows about your alternative buyer. Accepting ensures you make a profit without the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays."
