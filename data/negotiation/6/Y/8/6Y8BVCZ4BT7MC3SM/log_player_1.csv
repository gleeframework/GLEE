Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $18,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still secure a price above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high demand and value, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its worth.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit.  However, be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. You can always adjust your price closer to $15,000 in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
