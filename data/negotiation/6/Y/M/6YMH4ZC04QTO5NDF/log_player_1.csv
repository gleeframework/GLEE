``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, aiming to build a cooperative tone from the start.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation before I need to consider John's offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is truly serious about purchasing the product.  I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, showing I'm not desperate for a sale.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not convinced that this is the best deal I can get.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle prematurely. I'll continue to push for a higher price in the hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're determined to get a great price, and I respect that.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.
