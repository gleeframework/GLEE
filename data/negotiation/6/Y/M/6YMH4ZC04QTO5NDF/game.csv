"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're determined to get a great price, and I respect that.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,137,500. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair outcome.  Let's close this deal.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
