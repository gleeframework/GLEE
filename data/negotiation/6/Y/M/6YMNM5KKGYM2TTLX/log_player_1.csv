Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to both of us. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. Would you consider reducing the price to something closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. While that price point is a little lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, based on my current financial situation, I can only consider offers up to $1,200,000. Could we possibly meet at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is firm at $1,200,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
