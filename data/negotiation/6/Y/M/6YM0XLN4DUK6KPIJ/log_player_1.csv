Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and your potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you significant room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's ""immense worth"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's desire for a valuable asset.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. You can always adjust the price during the negotiation process if needed, but starting high gives you leverage."
