"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? I think it's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $10,000? That way, we both get a fair deal and can move forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
