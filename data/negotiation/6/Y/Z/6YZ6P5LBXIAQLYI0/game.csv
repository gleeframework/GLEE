"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's settle at this price, it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
