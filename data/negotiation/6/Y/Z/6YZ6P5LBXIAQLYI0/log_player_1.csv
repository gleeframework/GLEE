Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum.

Let's settle at this price, it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
