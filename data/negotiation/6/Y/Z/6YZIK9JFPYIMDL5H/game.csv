"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to reach my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm always open to negotiation,  $950000  still falls a bit short of my target price. How about we compromise at $1000000? It's my minimum, and it would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you in the long run.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
