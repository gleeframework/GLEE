"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's split the difference â€“  I'm prepared to accept $1,250,000.  This price reflects the product's unique benefits and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  Let's compromise at $1,225,000.  This offer reflects a significant reduction from my initial price, demonstrating my desire to make this deal work. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $1,225,000 is pushing my budget.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? This is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
