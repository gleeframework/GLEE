``` 

I'm starting with my highest possible price. Since I can sell to John for $100, there's no reason to accept anything lower.  Bob might counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $75 is too low for me, and I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price of $100 but still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
