"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it, based on its potential and market value. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I am confident that this product could significantly benefit your operations. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1100000 is a considerable amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the product's potential, but it also recognizes your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1250000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1200000,  which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
