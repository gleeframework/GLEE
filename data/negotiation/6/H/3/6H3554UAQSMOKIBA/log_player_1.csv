{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $115 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $85, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. However, $85 is too far below what I need to sell it for.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
