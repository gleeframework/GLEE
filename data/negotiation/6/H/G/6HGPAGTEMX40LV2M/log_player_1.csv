"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good price too. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I am looking to keep my spending under $10,000 if possible. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $10,000, I'm holding out for a better price. I have 9 rounds left and the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price for you and fair for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
