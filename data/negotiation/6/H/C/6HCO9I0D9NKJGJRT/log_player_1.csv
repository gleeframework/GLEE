"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiation but my starting price is $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob values the product at. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I also want to highlight that this is a valuable product to me,  giving Bob an incentive to negotiate seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a much higher price if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is a decent compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for more."
