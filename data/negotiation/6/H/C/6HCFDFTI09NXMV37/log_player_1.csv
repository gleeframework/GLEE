Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, but we also need to leave room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $12,000 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" (saving him $3,000) while securing a significant profit for Alice ($4,000 above her minimum). 
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember that Alice has a fallback option with John at $8,000. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price slightly during further negotiation."
