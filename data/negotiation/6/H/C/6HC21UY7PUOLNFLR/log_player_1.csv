"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $90, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my minimum of $100.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to build rapport. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my minimum price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob. 
* **10 Rounds:** I have limited rounds, so I need to be assertive but also willing to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum of $100. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get him closer to my $100 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the counteroffer. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $87.50? This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm proposing a compromise price that is closer to my minimum and still reasonable for Bob.  
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair solution for both of us. 
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and hoping to build rapport.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Moving Towards Minimum:**  I'm incrementally moving towards my minimum price while still acknowledging Bob's needs.
* **Balancing Assertiveness and Flexibility:** I'm being assertive in my counteroffer, but also showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $86.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $86 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to go higher, especially since he's already shown a willingness to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to my minimum price and secure a deal that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $86 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $88.  This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I'm also providing a reason for this price, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm focusing on the idea that this price benefits both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a win-win situation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and hopeful to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm steadily closing the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offers, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to be more assertive while still being flexible."
