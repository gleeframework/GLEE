"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, or you might be able to find a middle ground.  Buying from John is a backup plan, but you should try to get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, which is the same price John is offering. This makes my position clear, and hopefully, Alice is willing to negotiate from here. If she's not, I'm happy to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my ideal range. I'm willing to pay a bit more than John's price if it means getting a better deal, but $1,500,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price halfway between Alice's current offer and my maximum price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better deal. It also gives Alice some room to counteroffer without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay a little extra if it means getting a better deal than John's, but I'm not going to overpay. I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm hoping she'll meet me in the middle and accept this offer. If not, I'm still within my budget to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high on her price, and we've gone back and forth a few times. At this point, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the safer option of buying from John."
