"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
