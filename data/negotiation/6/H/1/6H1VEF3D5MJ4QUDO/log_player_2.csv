The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. You can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You're willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for you and hopefully enough to entice Alice to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is now offering $90. While this is better than her previous offer, it's still above your limit. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $80, as you're guaranteed a price you're comfortable with."
