"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer is $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1150000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1150000 is closer, but I'm still a little too high. I'm happy to meet you at $1100000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm going to have to pass on $1100000. I can offer you the product for $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
