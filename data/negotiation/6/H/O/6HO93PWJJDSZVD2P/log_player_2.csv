"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and her offer is $12,000.  It's best to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're starting with your maximum price. This sets the tone for the negotiation and shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for your budget. You're determined to pay no more than $8,000. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, even though John is a guaranteed $8,000 option.  There's a chance Alice will come down to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're sticking with your initial offer, emphasizing that you're serious about buying the product, but only at your price point. This shows you're not willing to budge further, putting pressure on Alice to decide."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer the product to you for $9500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still $1,500 above what you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're increasing your offer by $500, showing you're willing to compromise.  You're aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's desired price, but still within your budget, making it a more tempting offer for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer the product to you for $8750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $750 above your maximum budget of $8,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and reaching a stalemate is high. Additionally, you've already gone through several rounds and have limited time. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price and avoids further negotiation."
