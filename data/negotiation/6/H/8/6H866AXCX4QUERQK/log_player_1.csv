{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a good compromise - it's above your minimum and leaves room for negotiation.  This will hopefully encourage Bob to accept, but if he doesn't, it leaves space for you to counter-offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, so I'll reject it for now.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,050,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now just above my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal and ensures I make a profit."
