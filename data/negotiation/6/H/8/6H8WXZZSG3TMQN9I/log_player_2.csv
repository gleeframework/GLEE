"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You're aiming for a price closer to $800,000, and you have 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $925,000? This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. Continue negotiating to try and get closer to your target price of $800,000. You still have several rounds left to reach a favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $875,000. This would be a significant saving for me while still allowing you to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as a final offer. This would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your target price, but $900,000 is still too high.  Continue to negotiate, but keep in mind that you can always buy from John for $800,000 if you don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $885,000.  This represents a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $885,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $895,000 as a final offer. This is a good price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's make this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $895,000 is a good compromise.  It's within your budget and you only have a few rounds left.  It's more likely that you'll reach a better price if you keep negotiating, but it's risky to keep rejecting offers as you could end up with nothing.  Accepting this offer is a safe bet and allows you to secure the product without risking a last-minute loss."
