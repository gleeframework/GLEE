"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle for $925,000? This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $875,000. This would be a significant saving for me while still allowing you to get a fair price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as a final offer. This would allow us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $885,000.  This represents a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",885000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $885,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $895,000 as a final offer. This is a good price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's make this deal.",895000.0,Alice,7,
