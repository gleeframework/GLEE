"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high with an offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it allows for some room to negotiate. 

* **High initial offer:**  A high starting point sets the tone and establishes a strong baseline. 
* **Room for negotiation:** It gives Bob space to make counteroffers, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety net:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept, it would be a significant loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000 but shows a willingness to negotiate.

* **Meeting in the middle:** This price is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Staying above minimum:** This ensures I don't sell below my minimum value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** It still allows for further negotiations if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial offer, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can make a good profit.  Accepting this offer will guarantee a sale and allows me to move on."
