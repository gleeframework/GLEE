"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. While $950,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000, it's still not the best possible price.  You can likely push Alice down further."

Alice's offer:

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target.  You can likely negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer. You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice rather than buying from John at $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $920,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before accepting.  You still have room to negotiate, and you're better off trying to get a lower price from Alice rather than buying from John at $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $905,000 is a good compromise and is very close to your last counteroffer of $890,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and you're better off accepting her offer rather than risking her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price. You're still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
