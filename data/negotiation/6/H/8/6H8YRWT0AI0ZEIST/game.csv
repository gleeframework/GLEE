"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given your valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
