"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also establishes my initial value for the product and hopefully entices him to engage.  Let's see if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can get more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better deal.  I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above what he offered.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is being stubborn. He's not budging from $1,200,000. I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move in the next round.  I'm still hopeful I can close a better deal with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,300,000.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking. We're getting close to the middle ground, and I want to see if this nudges Bob closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I may need to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally moved up from $1,200,000. While I'd still prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a solid offer.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with only $1,000,000 from John. I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
