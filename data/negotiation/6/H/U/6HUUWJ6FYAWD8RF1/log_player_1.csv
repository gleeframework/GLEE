Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me a potential profit. However, it's also not too high that it would be immediately rejected by Bob.  If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $120, so I have nothing to lose by trying for a higher price."
