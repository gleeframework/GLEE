"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price, and it's too close to the $8,000 I can get from John. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $10,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise. It's also more attractive than the $9,000 he offered, and likely enough to keep him engaged in the negotiation rather than going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than what John is willing to pay.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent profit, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away or make a lower counteroffer, leaving me with a worse outcome.  Accepting his offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
