Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially make even more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves him with a potential $350,000 gain if he can leverage the product effectively. This creates a tempting incentive for him.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other interested parties introduces a sense of scarcity and urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible sale price while still making a deal highly attractive to Bob."
