Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations.  My asking price is $900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we start the negotiations at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than the product's value to me. I want to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low at this point.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $750,000? This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm eager to work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my bottom line, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'm going to see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your financial constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $825,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $780,000? I believe that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $780,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware of the time constraints and the option to sell to John for $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.
