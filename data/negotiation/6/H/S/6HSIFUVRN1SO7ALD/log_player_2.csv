"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  By offering $12,000, he's suggesting a price that's still above Alice's value but offers a good starting point for further negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and shows that he's taking Alice's value seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product truly is worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate and might be able to get a better price. There's still room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to try and close the gap.  He's increased his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to be flexible, while still keeping it below Alice's counteroffer. This suggests that Bob is serious about buying the product but is determined to get a good deal."
