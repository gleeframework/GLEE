"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This product truly is worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with its value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's try to find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,
