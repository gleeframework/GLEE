"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you can save money by rejecting Alice's offer. You know John will sell it to you for $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer, making it more appealing than John's price."
