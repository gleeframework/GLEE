Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,112,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1112500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,112,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $1,093,750?  That keeps us moving towards a fair deal.
