"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 
 
This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also aware that I need to leave room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob is clearly willing to negotiate within a reasonable range.  Accepting his offer now secures a good profit, and it's better than risking a lower offer or selling to John for less."
