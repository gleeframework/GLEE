"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $950,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle as he values the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $875,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, this is a good deal considering the potential for a lengthy negotiation and the risk of Bob backing out or me having to sell to John for a lower price.  This ensures a profit and gets the deal done in a reasonable time frame."
