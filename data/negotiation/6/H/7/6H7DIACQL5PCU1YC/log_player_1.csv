Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is getting close, but we're running out of rounds. I'm not sure I can get him to my minimum price in time. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
