"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle, and I'll take $1,350,000. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close the transaction quickly.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,325,000 is still not quite there yet.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $1,337,500. This way, we can both be happy with the deal.",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. How about we try $1,320,000? That's the best I can do.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
