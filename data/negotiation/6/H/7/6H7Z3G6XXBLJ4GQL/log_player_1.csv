{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** You're leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting a higher price than John would offer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price reflects a good faith effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this aligns closely with its value to me and would be a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price. There's a significant difference between $800,000 and what the product is worth to Bob. Let's see if we can bridge the gap!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for its worth.  How about $850,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my need to recover a decent portion of its true worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates you're open to negotiation.
* **Still above your minimum:**  You're holding firm on getting more than your absolute minimum.
* **Leaves room for further compromise:**  You're leaving some wiggle room for Bob to counter, but it's getting closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good deal considering:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your floor price of $800,000.
* **It's a fair compromise:** Both parties are making concessions.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer:** It's unlikely Bob will offer more, and John would only offer $800,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision to maximize your earnings."
