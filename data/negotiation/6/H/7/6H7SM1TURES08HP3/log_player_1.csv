Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $10,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $9,500 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $1,500 less than its worth to him.
    * I make a profit of $1,500 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still staying above my minimum."
