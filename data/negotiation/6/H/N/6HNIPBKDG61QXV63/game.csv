"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. My initial offer is $900,000. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  This product could be useful for us, but $900,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While I'm willing to be flexible, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000 to get this deal done.  I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm ready to make a final concession. How about we settle at $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. It's my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,7,
