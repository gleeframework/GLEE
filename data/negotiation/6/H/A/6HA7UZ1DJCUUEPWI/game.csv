"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'd be happy to buy it for $1100000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1200000, which is my maximum.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
