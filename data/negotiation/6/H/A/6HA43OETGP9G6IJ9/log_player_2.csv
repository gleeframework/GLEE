"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$400,000 is a great price, but I can likely get it for less. It's worth exploring Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on her response and the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. There are many rounds left, and I can continue to negotiate for a lower price. I don't want to rush into a decision and potentially miss out on an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, but I'm not yet ready to accept her price.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more savings before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to my last counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll reject my next offer and we'll be stuck with the option of buying from John at a much higher price.  At this point, it's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoid the potential of losing the deal altogether."
