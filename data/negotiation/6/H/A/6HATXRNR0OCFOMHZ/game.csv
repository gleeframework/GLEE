"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to negotiation. How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250.  This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
