Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential ""loss aversion"" for Bob. He might feel like he's getting a good deal by acting quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a small chance Bob might try to negotiate further, but I'm comfortable rejecting a counteroffer and going with John."
