Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
