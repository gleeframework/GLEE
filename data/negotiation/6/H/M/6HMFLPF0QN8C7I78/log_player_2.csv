"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $85. This is a great deal, as I could easily sell it to someone else for $80. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $80 from John, which is a better deal than paying $85 to Alice.
