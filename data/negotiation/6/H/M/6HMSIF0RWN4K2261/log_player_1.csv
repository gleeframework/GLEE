Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, exceeding my minimum price of $800,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob allows me to aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a substantial profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't be left empty-handed.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a high profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation or moving to another buyer."
