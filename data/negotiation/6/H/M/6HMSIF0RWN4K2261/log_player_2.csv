"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd pay $1,300,000 from Alice versus $1,500,000 from John. 
* **Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), it's still within your budget and a better deal than John's.**"
