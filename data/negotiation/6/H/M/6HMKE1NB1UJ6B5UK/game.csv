"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low.  The value of this product is substantial, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your willingness to come closer to my price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1250000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
