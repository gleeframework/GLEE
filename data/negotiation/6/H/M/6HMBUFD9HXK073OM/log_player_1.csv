"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept it immediately. This sets a high baseline for negotiations.
* **Value Justification:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob,  encouraging him to consider the potential return on his investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm stating my price but also leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.

This approach is designed to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm still hopeful I can negotiate a better price with Bob within the remaining rounds.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my value of the product, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1,700,000. This price still allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $2,000,000 offer. 
* **Fair Price:**  $1,700,000 is still significantly more than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the potential benefits for both of us.

I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Time:**  While John's offer is a guarantee, I'm not yet convinced that Bob won't budge further, especially as we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push him closer to my desired price. 

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stand:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still firm in my stance.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits of accepting my offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will push Bob to accept or at least make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. However, if he rejects again, I'll need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiations, and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Income:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed deal and aligns with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing with Bob risks wasting more time and potentially ending with a lower price than John's offer.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of him rejecting further offers and the potential for further delays makes John's offer the more logical choice at this point."
