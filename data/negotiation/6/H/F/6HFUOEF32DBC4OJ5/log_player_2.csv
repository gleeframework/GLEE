"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, Bob! I'm looking to sell it to you for a very competitive price. I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John offers.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget. 
* **Respectful Tone:** It's important to maintain a polite and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation.  
* **Clear Intention:** By stating a specific price, you're signaling your interest but also setting a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $120, but I'm thinking we can do better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is coming down, $110 is still above your $100 budget and what John offers. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's message suggests she's open to further negotiation (""we can do better than that""). 
* **John as Backup:**  You always have the option to go with John's $100 offer if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to move up a little, how about $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Moving from $80 to $90 shows willingness to compromise, but avoids a large jump.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's flexibility. If she's truly aiming for the middle, she might accept.  
* **John Option in Mind:**  While negotiating, you're still aware that John's $100 offer is your fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I think we can do better than that. How about we try $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105. Her language suggests she's holding firm near this price point. 
* **John's Price is Better:** You know you can get the product for $100 from John.  
* **Saving Money is Key:** Your goal is to get the best deal, and at this point, John's offer is the most financially sensible."
