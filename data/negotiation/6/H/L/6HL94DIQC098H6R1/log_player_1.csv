Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I could do $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. Let's try $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.
