"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $20,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I have to make a living, and I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering I can get the same product from someone else for $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $18,000, which would be $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
