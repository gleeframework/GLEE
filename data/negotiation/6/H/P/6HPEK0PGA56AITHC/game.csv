"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to profit from this transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was hoping to get closer to the $1,000,000 value you placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Let's split the difference and aim for $900,000.  This price would be a good compromise, allowing both of us to make a fair deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm confident that this price will be more acceptable to me. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $920,000. I'm still hoping for a bit more room to negotiate, as I'm aiming to stay under $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $910,000? This price would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, which is just $5,000 above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
