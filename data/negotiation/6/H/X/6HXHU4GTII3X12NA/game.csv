"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,750? That's my final offer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $12,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,250, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",12250.0,Bob,6,
