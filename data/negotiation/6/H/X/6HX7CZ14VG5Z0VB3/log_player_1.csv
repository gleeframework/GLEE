"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $135. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $128? This still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $125 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price. Given that I have limited rounds and John is also offering $120, it's better to accept this offer and secure the sale.  There's a good chance I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
