"Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $128? This still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",128.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $125 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a fair agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
