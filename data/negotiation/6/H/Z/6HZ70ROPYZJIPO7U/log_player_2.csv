"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but not ideal:** $75 is a good price, but you can likely get a better deal.
* **Potential for improvement:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so you have time to try and lower the price further.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John will sell for $100 gives you leverage in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

You will send a counteroffer to Alice in the next round, aiming to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $60 offer is a significant drop from Alice's $75, demonstrating your desire for a lower price. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While lower than $75, it's still within your budget, so you're not taking a major risk. 
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing John will sell for $100 keeps Alice aware that you have an alternative.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to start the negotiation moving in your favor. If Alice accepts, great! If not, you can adjust your offers in subsequent rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is not ideal:**  $85 is a step back from your initial $60 offer, but it's still higher than your ideal price. 
* **Negotiation space:**  You have more rounds to work with, and there's likely still room for a compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You have John as an option, so you don't need to settle just yet.

**Next Steps:**

You'll send another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get Alice closer to your desired price. You might consider a slightly higher counteroffer than your previous $60 to signal a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and progress:**  $70 is a midpoint between Alice's last offer of $85 and your previous offer of $60. This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining pressure:** It's still lower than Alice's desired price, keeping the pressure on her to find a compromise.
* **Avoiding John:**  You're still close to your target price and don't want to resort to John's offer yet, as that would likely mean less room for negotiation in the future.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to inch closer to your goal. If Alice accepts, you've achieved a good deal. If she rejects, you can continue adjusting your offers based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her previous offer, $90 is still above your target price and outside your preferred range.
* **John's offer is tempting:**  You're getting closer to your budget limit with Alice's offer, making John's $100 option more appealing.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  You have five rounds remaining. There's still potential to get a better deal, even if it means taking a slight risk.

**Next Steps:**

You'll send another counteroffer in the next round, but you'll need to be more aggressive.  Consider offering a price that's closer to your budget limit to see if it pushes Alice towards accepting.  Be prepared to potentially buy from John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bold but calculated:**  $75 is a significant increase from your previous offer of $70, but still lower than Alice's $90. It demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still maintaining your desire for a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a test to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  If she rejects, you'll need to be prepared to move closer to John's offer in the next round.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  You're taking a slight risk, but you're close to your budget limit and have only a few rounds remaining.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated gamble.  It could lead to a deal, or it could push you closer to John's offer.  The outcome will depend on Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $95 is way above your budget limit, and there are only a few rounds left. 
* **John's offer is now the better option:**  You've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Alice is likely to lead to a worse deal than buying from John for $100. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  By buying from John, you're guaranteed a price within your budget and avoid potentially ending up with a worse deal.

**Strategy:**

While you were able to get Alice to lower her price, it's clear that she's unwilling to come down to a price that's acceptable to you.  Switching to John minimizes your risk and ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
