"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $130? That's a significant reduction on my part to try and find a compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
