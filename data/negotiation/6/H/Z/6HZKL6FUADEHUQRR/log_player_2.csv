Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $835,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $800,000.  While we could try another counteroffer, there's a good chance she won't budge much further and we risk losing the deal. Accepting at $835,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
