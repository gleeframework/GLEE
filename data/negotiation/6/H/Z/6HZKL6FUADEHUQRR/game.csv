"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would you consider $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $810,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $835,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",835000.0,Alice,5,
