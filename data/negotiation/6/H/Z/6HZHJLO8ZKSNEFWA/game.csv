,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
