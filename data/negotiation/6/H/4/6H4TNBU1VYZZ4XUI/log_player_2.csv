"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $80 for the product, and John is selling it for $80.  Since Alice is also asking for $80, there's no advantage to buying from her.  You might as well reject her offer and buy from John."
