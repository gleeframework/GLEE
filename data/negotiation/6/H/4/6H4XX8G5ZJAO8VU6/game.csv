"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a fair price that's within our budget, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
