"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a workable solution, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,150,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
