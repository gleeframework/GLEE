"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate it, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $110.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
