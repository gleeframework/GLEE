Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's something I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair considering its potential benefit to your business.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering a price below Bob's valuation:**  I'm offering $1,250,000, which is less than what the product is worth to Bob, making it attractive for him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, this offer still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Emphasizing the product's value to both of us helps create a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with ensuring a high chance of Bob accepting the offer."
