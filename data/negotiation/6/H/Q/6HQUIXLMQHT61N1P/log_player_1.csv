"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's only $50,000 less than what John is offering. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as we are already in the fourth round and I want to avoid potentially losing the deal completely.  $1,250,000 is a decent price, and I'm happy to close the deal."
