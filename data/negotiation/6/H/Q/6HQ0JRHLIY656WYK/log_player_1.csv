"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to respond. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm focusing on Bob, I'm aware that John is an alternative buyer willing to pay my minimum price. This informs my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **John is a safety net:**  I have John as an alternative buyer, guaranteeing me my minimum price. This makes me less pressured to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can use the next round to make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,350,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** My message emphasizes finding a ""good deal for both of us,"" fostering a sense of partnership and encouraging a positive response from Bob.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm still mindful that I can sell to John for my minimum price, but I want to exhaust negotiation options with Bob before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John is a secure option:** I can sell to John for my desired price, making me comfortable rejecting lower offers.
* **Room for negotiation:** We are getting closer, and there's still room to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This compromise acknowledges your needs while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising further:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
* **Focusing on compromise:** I'm highlighting the ""middle ground"" to make it clear that we're both making concessions.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** My message emphasizes ""working together"" to close the deal, encouraging a positive and constructive response from Bob.
* **John is still the backup:**  I'm confident that John will buy the product if Bob doesn't, so I can afford to be firm in my counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,280,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is my safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for my desired price, making me less pressured to accept Bob's offer.
* **Small negotiation gap:**  We are very close in our pricing, but I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,280,000 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about $1,290,000? It's a small difference, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a very small concession this time, showing I'm flexible but still standing my ground. 
* **Emphasis on closing:** My message focuses on ""making this happen"" and emphasizes the ""small difference"" to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Positive and urgent tone:** I'm using a positive and slightly urgent tone to try to get Bob to accept the offer. 
* **John is still the backup:** I have a solid backup plan with John, so I can afford to be firm in this final negotiation push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,290,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, which is the best I can do. Can we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  We are in round 8, and only two rounds remain. With each passing round, the likelihood of getting a better offer from Bob decreases.
* **John is the safe option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000, ensuring I get my desired value.
* **No significant gain:**  While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, it's not a significant improvement. The potential for further negotiation with Bob is minimal, and the risk of a deal falling through is high. 

Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point, as it guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
