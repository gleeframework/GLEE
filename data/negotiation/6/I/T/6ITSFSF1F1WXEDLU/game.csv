"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm still very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $875000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds and the potential we both see in this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $920000? This is my final compromise.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $920000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $890000. It's a fair price, and I believe this is a deal that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up any more ground. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm thinking $915000 might be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $915000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $890000.  To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to meet you at $900000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not going to give up on this deal, Bob. I think we can meet in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $912500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",912500.0,Alice,9,
