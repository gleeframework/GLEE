"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $750,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, while I recognize its value, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is still above your target price, but it's a significant compromise from her previous offer.  Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, accepting this offer is a good move. You'll get the product for a lower price than John's offer, and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate any lower with Alice."
