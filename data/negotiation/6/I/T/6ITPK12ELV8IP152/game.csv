"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, while I recognize its value, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget.",725000.0,Alice,3,
