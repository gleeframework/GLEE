Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, while I recognize its value, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
