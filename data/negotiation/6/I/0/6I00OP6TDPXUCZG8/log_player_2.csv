"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate with John, or if unsuccessful, buy from him at $150.  This ensures you get the product within your budget."
