Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $200. It's a steal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $150, it makes the most sense to sell it to John and avoid further negotiation."
