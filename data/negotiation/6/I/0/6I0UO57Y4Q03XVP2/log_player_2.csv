"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $135 is less than your $150 limit, making it a viable option.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Alice has moved from her initial $140, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal. It's likely Alice won't go much lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether or running out of rounds.

**Conclusion:** Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, as it secures the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a potential stalemate or a higher price from John."
