"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a very competitive price.  Considering its value and potential, I'm starting with a price of $1450000. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1300000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1375000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below your target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be closer to my budget. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to stay within your budget, but $1250000 is simply too far below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1325000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about buying, this is my best offer. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,
