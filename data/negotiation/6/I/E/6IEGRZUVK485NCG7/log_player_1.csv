Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 sets a high anchor point while still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start above Bob's perceived value to allow for potential concessions.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" to subtly steer Bob's focus towards the product's advantages rather than solely on the price.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  The fact that John exists isn't explicitly mentioned, but the offer implies a sense of urgency and exclusivity, suggesting Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a price point that maximizes profit while ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why this offer is a strong starting point:

* **If Bob Accepts:** Alice makes a significant profit ($350,000) above her minimum. 
* **If Bob Negotiates:** There's room to haggle down towards Bob's $1,000,000 valuation while still staying above Alice's minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  Alice has a guaranteed backup offer from John at her desired price.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation, giving Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit."
