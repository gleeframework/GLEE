"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,500. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,5,
