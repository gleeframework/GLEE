,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1150000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $900000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000 for the product. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the value I'm willing to pay.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be on price. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final price of $1000000. This offer takes into account the value of the product and your budget. I truly believe this is a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
