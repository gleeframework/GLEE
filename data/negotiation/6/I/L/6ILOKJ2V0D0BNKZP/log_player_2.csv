"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $170 when you can get it for $120 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It aims to gauge her willingness to negotiate while still being a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to keep negotiating and see if we can get a better deal.  John is still a backup option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This counteroffer increases your offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying below your maximum value. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum value, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit further. You might be able to secure a better deal in the next round.  Remember, John is still a backup option if you need it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This counteroffer is your maximum price,  as you can get the product from John for this price.  This strategy aims to test if Alice will accept your final offer. If she doesn't, you can always purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum value. There's no point in continuing the negotiation when you can get the product from John for a guaranteed $120.  There are only three rounds left and you are unlikely to get a better offer from Alice."
