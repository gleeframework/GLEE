{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John, meaning there's potential for a better deal. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This initial offer is significantly lower than her original price, which might encourage her to negotiate.  The goal is to test the waters and see if she's open to a deal closer to my maximum budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $375,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my counteroffer and leaves room for negotiation. I'm willing to keep exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $300,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate seriously. I hope this encourages Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $350,000 is a good price considering my initial counteroffer and the fact that she's already rejected my latest one. It's significantly lower than John's price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. It's time to accept and secure the product."
