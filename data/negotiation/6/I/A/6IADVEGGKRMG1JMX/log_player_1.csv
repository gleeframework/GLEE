Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while also leaving a window for Bob to potentially accept the offer. If he rejects, I can still secure my minimum value with John."
