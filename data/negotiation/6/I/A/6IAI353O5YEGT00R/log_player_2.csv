"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are still rounds left, so it's worth seeing if Bob can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While $12,000 is tempting, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still within the range of the price he could get from John. Since Bob has 7 rounds left, there's still room for negotiation to get a price even lower than $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
