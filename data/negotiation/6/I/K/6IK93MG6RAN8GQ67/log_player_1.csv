```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000.  This is the highest possible price I can get, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it. I know it's above his perceived value, but negotiation is about finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my desired price, it's very close and I'm not sure I can get any higher. It's also a lot more than John's offer. I'm happy with this outcome!"
