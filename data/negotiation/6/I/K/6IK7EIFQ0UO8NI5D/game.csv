"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference at $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,5,
