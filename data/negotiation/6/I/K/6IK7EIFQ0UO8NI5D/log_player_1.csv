Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference at $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

While $800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
