"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get from the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a great price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $950,000, and I still think $700,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $950,000, so I'll offer $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
