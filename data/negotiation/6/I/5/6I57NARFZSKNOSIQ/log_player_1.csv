{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so theoretically, you could charge him up to that amount.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($14,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This ensures you won't be forced to accept anything less than your minimum acceptable price.

By aiming high but leaving some wiggle room, you maximize your chances of securing a sale at a price close to Bob's maximum valuation."
