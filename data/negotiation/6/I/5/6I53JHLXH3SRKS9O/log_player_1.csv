"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a compromise from my initial offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round. There's still a chance I can get closer to my target price, and selling to John for $10,000 is still a viable option if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a further concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value. I think Bob is getting closer to my target price, and I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 finally meets my minimum value.  While I would prefer to earn more, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product."
