# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a price that fits within his budget."
