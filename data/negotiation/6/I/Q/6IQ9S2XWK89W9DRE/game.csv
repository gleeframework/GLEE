"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant deviation from what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price, but I can't accept such a steep discount. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. Let's settle at $980,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $960,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
