"Hi Alice,  While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can find a way to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
