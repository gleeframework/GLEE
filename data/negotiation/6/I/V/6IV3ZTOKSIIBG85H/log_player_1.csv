Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I'm ready to counter his offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'm hoping we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
