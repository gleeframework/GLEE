Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get closer to the $100 price point.  While Bob is closer to my ideal price point, it's worth another round of negotiation to try and get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a bit to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
