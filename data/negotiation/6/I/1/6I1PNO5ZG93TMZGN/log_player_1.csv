Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he wishes. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $800,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed.

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, giving you the best chance of securing the highest possible price from Bob."
