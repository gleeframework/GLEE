"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $22,000, which reflects the high quality and performance of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and the product's worth to her ($15,000). It's highly likely she's starting with a high anchor price. You have plenty of room to negotiate and it makes sense to see if she'll come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget.  This product would be useful to me, but I'm only looking to spend in the range of $9,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Significant Counter:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening shows you're serious about a lower price point.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** $9,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably less than her initial offer but still gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed, while staying under your $8,000 walk-away point from John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses that you see value in the product but have a firm budget,  encouraging Alice to propose a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $9,000 is pretty far from what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $15,500 is still significantly higher than your budget and even her own valuation of the product. It's clear she's willing to negotiate, but you need to signal you're looking for a much lower price point. You still have plenty of rounds to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $15,500 is still too high for me. To be honest, I'm considering other options around $10,000. If you can come down to something closer to that, I'm still interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Pressure:**  You're continuing to apply pressure by significantly lowering your offer, but still keeping it above your absolute maximum.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly introduces competition and  might make Alice more willing to negotiate to avoid losing the sale.
* **Conditional Interest:**  You're signaling that while you're interested, your interest has limits. This makes it clear you're willing to walk away if a deal can't be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm also sensing you see the value in this product. $10,000 is too low, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice claiming this is her ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other potential buyers"" is a common negotiation tactic to create urgency. Don't let this pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with.
* **Still Above Budget:** While $13,000 is a significant decrease from her initial offer, it's still above your $8,000 walk-away price from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You still have five rounds left. By rejecting this offer, you can gauge how firm she is on this ""final offer"" and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me. I understand you have other potential buyers, but to be completely transparent, $11,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're acknowledging her concessions while firmly stating your maximum price. This leaves little room for misinterpretation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Offering to ""close the deal today"" adds a small incentive for her to accept, playing on her desire to avoid a lengthy negotiation. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  You're pushing closer to your limit, but this offer still provides a buffer from your absolute walk-away price. 
* **Testing the Water:** This counteroffer will reveal how serious Alice is about her ""final offer"" and whether there's any flexibility left."
