{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($100) but below what I know it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a good value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $95 is a decent offer.  It's a good compromise, and I'm not sure if I can get much better from Bob.  Also, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, Bob might walk away altogether.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
