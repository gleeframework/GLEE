"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, around $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9500.0,Alice,3,
