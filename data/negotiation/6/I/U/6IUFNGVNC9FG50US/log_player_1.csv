This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is a good compromise between my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).  I believe this gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible while keeping Bob happy enough to close the deal. We'll need to be flexible and adapt our strategy based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low. It's not a significant enough increase from my minimum value of $1,200,000 to warrant accepting. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,400,000. This is still within Bob's perceived value range, but shows I'm willing to compromise while also wanting to maximize my profit."
