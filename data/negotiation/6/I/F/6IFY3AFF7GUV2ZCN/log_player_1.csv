"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to secure a good price. I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but I'll be ready to counter his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for a price that's below what I consider fair. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than what Bob offered and closer to my target. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again. I'm hoping that with each round, we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. I'm steadily lowering my price, but I'm still holding out for a deal that's above my minimum value.  At this point, I'm hoping Bob is seeing the value in the product and will be willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is finally at my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and move on."
