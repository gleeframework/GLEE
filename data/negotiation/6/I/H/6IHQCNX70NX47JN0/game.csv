"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference at $105?  I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105, which would be $107.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",107.5,Alice,5,
