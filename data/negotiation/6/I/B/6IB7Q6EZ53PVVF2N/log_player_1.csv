Round 2
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $150? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 150}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can squeeze a little bit more out of Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ $140. That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a good deal, and $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for that low yet. I'm hopeful that in the next round I can get closer to my goal, but if not, I'll be ready to sell to John for $150."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  I've only got two rounds left and I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher than $130.  Selling to John guarantees me the highest price possible, and I'd rather have a guaranteed $150 than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
