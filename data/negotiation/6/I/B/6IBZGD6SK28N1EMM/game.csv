"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $8500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. I appreciate your offer, but $9000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  $9500 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to offer $9250. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,
