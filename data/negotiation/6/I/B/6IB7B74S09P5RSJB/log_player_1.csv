Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below the value he places on it, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get close to his maximum price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $125. This is still a good deal for him, as it's below his perceived value of the product.  However, it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now lower than what John is willing to pay.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to come up to a price that I find acceptable.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
