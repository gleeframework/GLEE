Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $110. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.
