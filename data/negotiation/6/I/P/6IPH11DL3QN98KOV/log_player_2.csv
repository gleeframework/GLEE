"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still potential to negotiate further.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so a counteroffer might lead to a better price."
