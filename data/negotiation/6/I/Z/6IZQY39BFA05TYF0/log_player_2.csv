"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While $11,500 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer keeps the bargaining going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'll meet you at $11,750, and that's my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,750 is a bit closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and higher than what John would sell it for. Bob still has room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer keeps the bargaining process alive.  It also allows Bob to assess if Alice will come down further or if he should move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference at $11,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'll give you a slight discount to $11,900, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $11,900, which is slightly lower than John's price but still higher than Bob's ideal.  The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers are unlikely to get Bob a better price.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 to guarantee the purchase and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
