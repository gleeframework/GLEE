"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $100, and that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $70. It's a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting nowhere, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to make a profit on this sale.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a good price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way to $85, Bob, but I can meet you in the middle at $90. That's as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally close this deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
