Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $149 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially going slightly higher. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not starting at $150, I subtly imply there might be other interested buyers, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes I have no way of knowing Bob's true valuation of the product. If I knew he valued it at $100, I might start lower to ensure a sale. However, in this scenario, maximizing my potential profit is key."
