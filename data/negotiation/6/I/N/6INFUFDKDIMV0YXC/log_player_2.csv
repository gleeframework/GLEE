Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you require further information to make a decision. I am here to answer any questions you might have and to assist in any way possible to ensure a smooth process.

Looking forward to your positive response,

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to your maximum price ($1,200,000) by stating she *understands* that's its worth to you.  Her offer, while lower, is still quite close to your maximum.  There's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay her full asking price. Since her product is worth significantly less to her ($1,000,000) than your maximum, she's highly motivated to make a deal. It's likely she'll come back with a lower offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
