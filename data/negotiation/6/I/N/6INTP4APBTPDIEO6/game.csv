"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I've given it some thought, and while I'm eager to make a deal, I can't quite go down to $1,800,000.  How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about its value. How about $1,975,000? That's a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
