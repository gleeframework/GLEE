**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save a lot of money by doing so."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is $1,000,000. This is the price I could get from John, so it's my baseline.  Alice might counter with a higher price, but I'm hoping to get her to come down closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both agree."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
