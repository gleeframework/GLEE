"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of how to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Selling to John at this point would be the safer option, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this price is within Bob's range and will entice him to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance he might increase his offer further. However, I'm also mindful that I only have a limited number of rounds, so I need to be strategic in how I proceed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This shows further compromise and indicates that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is more favorable to me than his last offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to counteroffer again, getting us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate might risk losing him altogether.  With only 4 rounds left, it's strategically sound to accept his offer and secure the sale."
