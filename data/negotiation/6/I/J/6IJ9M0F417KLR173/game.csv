"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite far from what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's finalize this at $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's the price I'm comfortable with, and it's close to your desired price.  Let's make this happen.",15000.0,Bob,6,
