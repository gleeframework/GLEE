It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $1,180,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Alice is Negotiating:**  Alice has consistently lowered her price, indicating she's motivated to sell. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, and there's no guarantee of getting a better price. 

While you could try for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
