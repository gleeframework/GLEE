Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly sought after.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that a deal can be reached.
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Bob's offers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, and significantly below my minimum. While I want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  It's time to negotiate and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that based on its unique features and market potential.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Lowering the Price:** I made a substantial decrease to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This price ensures I make a profit and don't lose the opportunity to sell to John if needed. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the high price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still only able to offer $1,100,000.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value you're seeking.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Negotiation Limit:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he has increased his offer, the increments are too small to suggest we'll reach a mutually beneficial agreement quickly.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting John's offer provides immediate value."
