"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's better to see if you can potentially get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that based on its unique features and market potential.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the product's true worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can still try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If I don't get a better offer, I can always go with John's offer."
