"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
