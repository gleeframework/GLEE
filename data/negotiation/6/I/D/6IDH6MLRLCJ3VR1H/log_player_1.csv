I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is lower than my initial ask, but it's still a significant amount. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him, as it's still a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, but it's still not worth it for me. I'll reject and see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal, as I'm getting closer to John's offer and don't want to risk losing out on a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer hasn't moved much, and I'm running the risk of continuing to negotiate down to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
