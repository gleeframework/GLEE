"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
