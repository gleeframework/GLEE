"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,100,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,300,000. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $1,175,000. Can you consider this offer?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
