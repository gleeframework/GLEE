"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $15,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $18,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}
