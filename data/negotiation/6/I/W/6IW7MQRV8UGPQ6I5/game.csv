"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $15,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product and its value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $18,000. This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",16000.0,Bob,4,
