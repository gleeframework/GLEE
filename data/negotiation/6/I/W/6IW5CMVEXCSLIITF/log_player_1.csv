""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I believe a price of $12,000 is fair for both of us, considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly above your $8,000 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
