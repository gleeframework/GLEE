"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $100. We're confident it will exceed your expectations and provide substantial value. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further. By rejecting this offer, you signal that the price isn't ideal. You can then wait and see if Alice makes a counter-offer. If her price doesn't come down, you still have the option to buy from John for $120."
