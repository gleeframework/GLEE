Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's fallback:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $800,000 with John. This is her ""safety net.""
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Potential for profit:**  There's a chance to get a price higher than $800,000 from Bob since he values the product at that amount.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Ambitious but justifiable:** The offer is significantly higher than Alice's fallback price, aiming to maximize her profit. The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" to support the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide if she wants to accept a slightly lower amount (still likely above $800,000) or proceed with her guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be strategically better.
* **Market urgency:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, a less aggressive price might be more suitable.
