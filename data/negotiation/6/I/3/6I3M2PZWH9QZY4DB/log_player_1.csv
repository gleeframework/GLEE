Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation.  It's above your minimum price but leaves room for Bob to counter and still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still below the value I'm aiming for. I will try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $9,500 is still a good deal, exceeding my minimum of $8,000 and getting closer to my ideal value. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to Bob entirely."
