"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, given the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000, which is a significant amount for me and reflects the value I see in the product.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,225,000.
