"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
