"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've put in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $875,000? This would allow us to both make a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $900,000. How about $920,000?",920000.0,Alice,5,
