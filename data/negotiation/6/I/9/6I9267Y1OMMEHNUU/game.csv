"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my original price reflects the true scarcity and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is firmly above that mark. I'm willing to accept $1,800,000.  This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
