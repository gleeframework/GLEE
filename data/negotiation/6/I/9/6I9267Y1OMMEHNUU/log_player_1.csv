Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need us to be closer to my budget.  I can go up to $1,300,000, but that's absolutely my limit.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean a $200,000 loss compared to John's standing offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
