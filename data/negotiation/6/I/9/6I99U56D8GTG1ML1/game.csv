"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is more in the $10,000 range.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
