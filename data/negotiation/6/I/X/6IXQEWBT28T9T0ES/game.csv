"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and confirming your interest. While your initial offer is a bit lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to continue this conversation.  To make this work, I would need to be closer to $1,700,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment. Let's find a middle ground here that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
