"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can offer the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $7,800? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",8100.0,Alice,7,
