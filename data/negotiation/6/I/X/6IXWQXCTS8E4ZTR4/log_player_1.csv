**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently offering prices significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. He's unlikely to drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk a lower final price."
