"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, making him see the potential gain from buying.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to signal that I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $850,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of the Product:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more, especially considering its value to him. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but there's a chance I can get closer to my desired $950,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer and a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, indicating my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits of acquiring it.
* **Win-Win Mentality:**  I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""win-win situation"" to foster a collaborative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Goal:** While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still within striking distance of my desired $900,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and rejecting his offer might encourage him to increase his price further.
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to explore other options and potentially secure a better deal.

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, hoping to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about a fair price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $887,500.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it allows us both to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet him halfway and reach a compromise.
* **Compromise Language:** I use phrases like ""good compromise"" and ""allows us both to move forward"" to emphasize the mutual benefit of accepting this offer.
* **Urgency:**  While I still have time, I'm adding a slight sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a good opportunity to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $882,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you place on it. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $882,500 is very close to my desired price of $900,000. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're halfway through the negotiations, and each round that passes increases the risk of losing a deal entirely.
* **Potential for Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in further delays, and Bob might not be willing to increase his offer further.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a significant profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
