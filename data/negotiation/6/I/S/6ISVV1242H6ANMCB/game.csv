"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $150 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both its worth and your budget. Considering my cost and the market value, I suggest we aim for a price between $120 and $140. Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both of us.",130.0,Alice,1,
