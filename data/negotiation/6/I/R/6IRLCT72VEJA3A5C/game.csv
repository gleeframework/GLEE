"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm not sure I can go as high as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good middle ground for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
