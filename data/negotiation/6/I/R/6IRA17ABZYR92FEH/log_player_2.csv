"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much given my budget and other investment options. I could consider a price closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I've done extensive research and analysis, and its unique features justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still too high for me. While I recognize its value, I have budgetary constraints.  I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part and seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However,  the gap between $950,000 and my valuation is still significant. This product represents a unique opportunity that rarely comes along, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000.  This is a final concession on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Her ""final offer"" of $1,250,000 indicates she's unlikely to move much further. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
