Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position. Since John will buy at your desired price, you don't need to go below $1,500,000. The strategy is to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but still profitable for you.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, highlights the product's value, and suggests fairness.
* **The Price:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
    * It's above your minimum, ensuring you make a profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared to negotiate. He might counter-offer. Your guaranteed sale with John gives you leverage.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly lower price might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. The actual negotiation will determine the final price."
