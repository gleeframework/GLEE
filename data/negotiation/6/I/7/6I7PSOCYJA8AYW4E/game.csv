"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $108? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to where I'm comfortable with the price.",108.0,Bob,4,
