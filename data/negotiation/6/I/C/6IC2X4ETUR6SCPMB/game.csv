"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $12,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",12200.0,Alice,5,
