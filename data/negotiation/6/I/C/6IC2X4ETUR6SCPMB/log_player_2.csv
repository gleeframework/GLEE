# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $12,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $12,200 is still above Bob's budget.  Since John is selling the product for $10,000, it's the best option to get the product within his price range."
