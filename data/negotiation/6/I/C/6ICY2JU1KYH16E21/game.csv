"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $9500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $11000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $10500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10500. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's still a bit higher than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11500.0,Alice,5,
