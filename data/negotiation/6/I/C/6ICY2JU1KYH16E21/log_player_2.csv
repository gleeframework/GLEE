Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $11000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.
