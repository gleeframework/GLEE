"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $12000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $10000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13000? That's still a great deal for you considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $10000.",12500.0,Bob,4,
