Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Benefit for both:** I'm emphasizing that it's a good deal for Bob, which can encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** $9,500 is not my absolute minimum. This allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $10,000 open, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John as a fallback:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the confidence to negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize that $8,500 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'm not pressured to accept a lower price because I know I can sell to John for $10,000.
* **Encouraging further negotiation:**  I use ""Let me know what you think"" to leave the door open for further discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $7,500 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No significant room for compromise:**  Further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to result in a price closer to my desired amount, especially since I know I can sell to John for $10,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take time and effort, and I could potentially lose the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price. 

Therefore, selling to John for $10,000 is the best option at this point."
