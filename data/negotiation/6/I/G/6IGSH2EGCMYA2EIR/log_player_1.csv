"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a unique piece with great value, and I believe this price is fair.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000) but not outrageously high to scare Bob away. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm mindful of the 10-round limit and need to establish a reasonable starting point quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but not too far off.**  While $12,000 is below my desired price, it's still a decent offer. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate further.** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.**  I'm not desperate enough to accept John's offer just yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting we find common ground to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Moving Closer to Target:**  This counteroffer brings me closer to my desired price point while still being within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12750. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is only $250 away from my minimum desired price of $10,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk Bob might walk away or become less flexible.
* **Time pressure:** The clock is ticking, and selling to John for $10,000 is becoming a more appealing option. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
