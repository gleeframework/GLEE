"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his upper limit and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000.  This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum. With only 6 rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
