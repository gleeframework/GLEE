Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price.  This gives us room to negotiate and potentially find a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target,  $9,200 is a fair price given the negotiation process. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Also, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit, but taking Bob's offer gets me closer to my initial goal."
