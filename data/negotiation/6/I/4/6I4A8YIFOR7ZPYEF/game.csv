"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a ways off from being comfortable at that price. How about we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
