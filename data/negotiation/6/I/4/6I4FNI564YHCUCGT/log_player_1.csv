Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could start lower, Bob stands to gain a significant amount ($1,000,000 value minus the purchase price). Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  The message hints at the product's high demand and Bob's privileged position as the first recipient of the offer. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth and justifies the high price. 

By starting with a strong offer, Alice increases her chances of getting closer to her desired profit margin while leaving room to negotiate down to a minimum of $800,000 if needed."
