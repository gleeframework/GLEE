"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $1400000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Alice. I really like the product, but I've already offered $900000 and you've come back with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my final offer. I need to know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm not willing to go any higher than $950000. I've already made it clear that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it doesn't meet my budget.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away from the deal, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise at this price.
