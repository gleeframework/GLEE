,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the potential in this product, my budget is capped at $800000.  I'm willing to pay that price for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $800000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $900000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the value I see in this product, and it's a price that offers a substantial return on investment for you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm firm at $850000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's make it happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
