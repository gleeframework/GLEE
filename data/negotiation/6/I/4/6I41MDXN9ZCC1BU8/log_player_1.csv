"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Emphasize value:**  My message focuses on the potential value the product holds for Bob, aiming to pique his interest and create a sense of urgency. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the potential in this product, my budget is capped at $800000.  I'm willing to pay that price for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I have 10 rounds and want to maximize my profit. Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to signal flexibility and encourage further negotiation. 
* I will reiterate the product's value and the opportunity it presents for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $900,000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the value I see in this product, and it's a price that offers a substantial return on investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential return on investment.
* **Open ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by asking for his opinion, encouraging him to respond and potentially move closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm firm at $850000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is high.
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd have to settle for John's offer of $800,000. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision in this situation. It secures a good price and minimizes the risk of losing out on a deal altogether."
