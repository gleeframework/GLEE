"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too low, considering my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob before I sell it to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $8,500 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $9,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget while still showing respect for your value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a good compromise, and hopefully, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price.  I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a good compromise and closer to our target price.  This is the best I can do, so let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already invested a lot of time in this negotiation, and I don't think I'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
