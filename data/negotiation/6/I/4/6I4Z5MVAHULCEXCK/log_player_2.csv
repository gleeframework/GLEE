"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer is close to his maximum budget, but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Bob emphasizes the importance of budget and offers a specific counteroffer. This creates a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Openness:** Bob's message ends with a question, encouraging Alice to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $8,500 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $10,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is willing to come down further, indicating there's still room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid Overpaying:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, preventing Bob from overpaying for the product."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $9,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget while still showing respect for your value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Fair:**  Bob sticks to his maximum budget range but offers a compromise price that is a significant step closer to Alice's offer.

* **Continuing Negotiation:** The message remains polite and open-ended, encouraging Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a good compromise, and hopefully, we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Over Budget:** While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity to Close the Gap:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further, and Bob can try to bridge the gap between their positions.
* **Risk of Overpaying:** Accepting at this point would mean paying more than Bob's absolute limit, which goes against his goal of saving money."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price.  I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There's still room to close the gap. Bob can continue to counteroffer and try to push Alice further down towards his desired price point.
* **Avoiding Overspending:**  Accepting the offer would mean paying more than Bob's absolute limit, which would go against his goal of saving money."
