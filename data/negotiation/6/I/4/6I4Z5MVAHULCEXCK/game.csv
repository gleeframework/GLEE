"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $8,500 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $9,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget while still showing respect for your value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a good compromise, and hopefully, we can close the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price.  I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a good compromise and closer to our target price.  This is the best I can do, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,8,
