"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer!  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product is worth a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $106.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $108? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",108.0,Alice,5,
