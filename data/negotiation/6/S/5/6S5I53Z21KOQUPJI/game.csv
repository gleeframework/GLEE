"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
