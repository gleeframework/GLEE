Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** $11,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, giving him some incentive to buy.
* **Lower than John's offer:**  $11,000 is lower than the $12,000 John is willing to pay, meaning you'll still make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to leverage the difference in value perceptions to get the best price possible from Bob while having a fallback option with John."
