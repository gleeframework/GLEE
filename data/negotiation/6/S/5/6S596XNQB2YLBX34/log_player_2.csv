"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a great opportunity to own it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than the $10,000 you can get it for from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $4,000 and still acquire the product."
