"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd really get a lot of use out of it. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer of $180 is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite while still clearly stating my price target. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice might be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is too low for me.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $140 is closer to my budget but still above the $120 I'm willing to spend.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving down from $180 to $140 indicates there's room for negotiation. 
* **John is the Backup:** I'll keep negotiating, knowing I have the option to go with John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm stating my maximum budget clearly but framing it as a reasonable compromise.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting $120, the midpoint between our previous offers, can feel like a natural agreement point.
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** This offer puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to sell at my price or risk losing the sale."
