Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to make more than $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay more, leaving room for negotiation.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is $110 which is higher than John's offer of $100, and very close to the initial offer of $115.  It's a good deal for me and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
