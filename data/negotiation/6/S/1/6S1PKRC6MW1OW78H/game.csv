"Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly an exceptional item, and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This price still reflects the high value of the product while allowing for a more reasonable compromise. I look forward to your feedback.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that respects the value of your product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Considering the value of the product and your continued interest, I am willing to accept a price of $875,000 for the product. This represents a compromise that I hope will lead to a successful transaction for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
