"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the quality and potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts!",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its market value. Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a substantial discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? That's a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can guarantee a quick and smooth transaction. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
