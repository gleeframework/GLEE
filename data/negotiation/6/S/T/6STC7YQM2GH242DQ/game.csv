"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $18,000 is fair.  What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
