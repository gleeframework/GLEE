"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value is well worth the price, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's actual value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on my side. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This demonstrates my seriousness in purchasing the product, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $700,000 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the unique features and potential value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects a substantial compromise on my part, but it's also a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this transaction.",850000.0,Alice,5,
