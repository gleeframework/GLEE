"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $85 for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's always worth negotiating, especially since you have the backup option of buying from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering!  While I appreciate the quality, $85 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from a starting offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is polite, acknowledges the product's value, but clearly states your budget constraints. 
* **Strategic Goal:** The counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly. Even if Alice rejects it, it sets the stage for a potential compromise closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget, I am willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $70 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $70 is better, you still have room to negotiate and get closer to your $65 target. You're not in a rush, and there's no harm in seeing if she'll come down further. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate the effort.  How about we settle at $68? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of sticking to $65, a slight increase to $68 shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, reiterating your appreciation for the negotiation process and proposing a specific price point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is open to a price below $70 or if she's firm on that amount."
