"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1750000.  This reflects the unique value of the product, and I believe it's still a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This is a fair compromise that hopefully works for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
