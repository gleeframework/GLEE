"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $110 for it. I hope this aligns well with your budget and expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your product but $110 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about $107 for the product? This price still reflects the value of the product while being more flexible for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:**  $107 is only $2 more than Bob's counteroffer of $105. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds.
* **Time is a factor:** Each round consumes valuable time.  It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal altogether."
