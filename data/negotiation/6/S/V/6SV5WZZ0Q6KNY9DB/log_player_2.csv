"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to play."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a good profit margin for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as I still have a chance to get a better deal from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's a better offer than previous rounds, I believe I can still get a better price.  I have several rounds left and don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't work for me financially. I'm still confident I can get a lower price and will continue to negotiate."
