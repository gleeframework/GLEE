"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $8,000. I need to negotiate a lower price.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to get her closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still significantly more than my $8,000 budget.  I'm going to counteroffer again to try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and not being able to reach a suitable price within the remaining rounds is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000."
