,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,5,
