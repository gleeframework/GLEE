Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $110 is still a bit low for me, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $115?  It's a fair price, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, $112 is still better than the $100 I would get from John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in an even lower price."
