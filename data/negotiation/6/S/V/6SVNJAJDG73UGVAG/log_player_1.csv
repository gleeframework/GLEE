Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to give myself some room to negotiate.  I'm also being upfront about my perceived value of the product to try and establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to deal with John.  It's better to secure the sale at this point."
