"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. My initial price is $1,750,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value I need to receive.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair deal. Let's see if we can agree on this compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to drop down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, but I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,400,000 is still too high. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to consider it, I think we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
