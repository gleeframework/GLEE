{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a significant amount to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a little room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for potential counteroffers that could still be profitable for you. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer and respond.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer depending on how Bob responds and what you feel is a fair price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and gives you a better value than your initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $975,000 is still not a good enough price for me. I'll counteroffer again and try to push for a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $998,000? It's a bit above my initial offer, but I'm willing to stretch to get a deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $998,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $998,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $998,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already given Bob several opportunities to negotiate, and it seems unlikely he'll meet my price.  Instead of continuing to haggle, I'll sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
