"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11500 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $13000.  This is still a fair price, considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12750. This is the highest I can go, but I really like the product and I think it's worth it. Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Bob,4,
