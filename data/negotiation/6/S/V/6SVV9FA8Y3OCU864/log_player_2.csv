"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and knows the product is worth $8,000 to him. He's not going to accept a price higher than that.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8000, but I have to consider my costs and make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than that. How about $8500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible and $8,500 is still a bit too high. He's willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still only comfortable paying $8,000.  I know that's your bottom line, but I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised by offering $8500 in the last round. I'm willing to meet you at $8200, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible.  He's only $200 away from his goal.  He's willing to try one more counter offer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to agree on $8,000. I know it's close to your bottom line, but this is the absolute most I can afford. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already compromised significantly by offering $8200, and I've made it clear that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to get at least $8300. If not, I'll have to consider other options. Can you meet me at $8300? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit for negotiation. He's only willing to pay $8,000. It's clear that Alice is not willing to go any lower.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it makes sense for Bob to purchase the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
