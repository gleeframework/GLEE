"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $82.50 is still a little more than I'd like to pay. How about $80?  That seems like a good middle ground for us both.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $81? It's just a tiny bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
