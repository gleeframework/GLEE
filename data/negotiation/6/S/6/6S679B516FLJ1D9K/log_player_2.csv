"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows him to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his ideal price point, he's still got more room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still trying to get as close to your initial offer as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price point. While $11,250 is slightly above his initial counteroffer, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000.  With only 5 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, as he might not be able to get a better price and risk having to buy from John.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer to secure the product at a reasonable price."
