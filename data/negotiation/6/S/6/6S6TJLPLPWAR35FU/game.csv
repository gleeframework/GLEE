"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think $1,150,000 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, reflecting both the product's value and my need to ensure a fair return.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility in considering a lower price, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
