Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive negotiation. 

**Important:** 

It's crucial to understand that this is a simplified negotiation scenario. In a real-world situation, factors like Bob's negotiation skills, the relationship between Alice and Bob, and market dynamics could significantly impact the outcome."
