"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $18,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Could you meet me halfway at $20,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",19000.0,Bob,4,
