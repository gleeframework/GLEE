"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would really benefit you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. As a starting point, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible and $10,000 is above my target price of $8,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?  I'm very interested in the product, and this price would make it a worthwhile investment for me."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my target price of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
