It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $1,750,000 is too high, and you know you can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  Let's see if you can get closer to that price by counteroffering."

Let's start with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to what John is offering. This should give us some room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Continue negotiating. You have room to lower the price further."

Since Alice lowered her price, let's counter with a price that's closer to hers but still within your budget. This shows you're serious about buying and willing to compromise."
