"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $65 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $85 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to sell for $80. That's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
