"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your input. I think we can find a price that works well for both of us. How about we aim for $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $110, as I mentioned before. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm open to negotiating further. How about we aim for $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'd like to propose $125 as our next step. This is a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to propose a price of $105, as I mentioned before. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider $115 as our next step. This is a bit higher than your last proposal, but it's still within a reasonable range. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,7,

"I'm making my final offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make a decision soon.",100.0,Bob,8,
