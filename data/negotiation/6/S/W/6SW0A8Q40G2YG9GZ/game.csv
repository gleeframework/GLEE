"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, and $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind. To be completely transparent, my budget allows for $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  However,  $7,000  is still quite a bit below what I can accept.  Perhaps we can meet in the middle? How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is closer, but still a stretch. I could potentially do $7,500. Do you think that could work?",7500.0,Bob,6,
