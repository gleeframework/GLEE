"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $125. Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That way, we both get a good price. What do you say?",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I'm happy with the progress we've made, $137.50 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,6,
