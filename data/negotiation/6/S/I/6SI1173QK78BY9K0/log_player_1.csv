"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My starting price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, knowing it's more than Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm hinting at the product's value to make him consider the offer even though it's higher than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  I'm not willing to sell for $100 as my minimum is $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Keeping Options Open:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range while keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** I'm offering $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but ensures I don't lose out on value.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $125. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum of $150.
* **Potential for higher offer:** He is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to increase his offer. There's a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not risking a lot by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That way, we both get a good price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation where both of us benefit from the price.
* **Strong closing:** I'm asking for a decision (""What do you say?"") to encourage Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I'm happy with the progress we've made, $137.50 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $120.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiating room:** We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and Bob hasn't shown much willingness to increase his offer. It's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Time is running out:**  We're nearing the end of our allotted rounds.  
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:**  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity.

It's a tough choice, but I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
