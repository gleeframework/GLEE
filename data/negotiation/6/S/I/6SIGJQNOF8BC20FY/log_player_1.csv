"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept $1,200,000. This product has significant value beyond what you're suggesting.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is coming closer to a reasonable price, we still have negotiating room and time. I'm willing to push a bit further before accepting an offer below $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll propose $1,225,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has gone down in larger increments than I'd like. His latest offer is significantly below my target.  I'm willing to hold firm for now and see if he's willing to move closer to my last offer.  We're getting closer to the point where I might consider John's offer, but I'll give Bob another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to see some movement on your end as well. How about $1,260,000?"",
""product_price"": 1260000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll propose $1,230,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting at $1,230,000 secures a substantial profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds."
