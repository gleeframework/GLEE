"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to be honest, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. The product is worth so much more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1300000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1000000 is a more reasonable price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1250000. That's my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept $1250000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get at least $1300000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support. I'm offering you a final counteroffer of $1350000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I still think $1250000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. I'm starting to think that we're at an impasse. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. I'll throw in some additional extras, such as a free installation and a 5-year maintenance contract, and I'll meet you at $1300000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm not willing to pay $1300000. I've made it clear that $1250000 is my maximum offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1500000.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
