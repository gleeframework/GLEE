Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially increasing my profit. 
* **Secure the Deal:**  It's unlikely Bob would find a better deal elsewhere, as my offer is still significantly less than his perceived value. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a high sale price while still ensuring a sale over the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
