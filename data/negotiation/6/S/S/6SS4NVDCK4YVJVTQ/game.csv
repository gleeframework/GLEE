"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle at $10,500. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I believe the product's value warrants a price closer to $11,200. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $10,800. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'll meet you at $11,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Please reconsider.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the end of the road. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'll meet you at $10,750. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,9,
