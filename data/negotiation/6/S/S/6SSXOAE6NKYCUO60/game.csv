,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,250 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,750. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",8750.0,Alice,5,
