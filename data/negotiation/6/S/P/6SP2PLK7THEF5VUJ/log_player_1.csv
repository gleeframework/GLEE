Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I wouldn't want you to miss out. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. How does $1,100,000 sound?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing we have John as a guaranteed backup. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but below our minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning we're open to discussing price and not starting too high, we encourage Bob to engage without scaring him off. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** We don't know how Bob negotiates. If he's known to be very price-sensitive, we might need to adjust our starting point lower in a future round.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though we have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial in the long run.  Our message aims to be collaborative, not just transactional."
