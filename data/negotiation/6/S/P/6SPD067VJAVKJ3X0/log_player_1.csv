Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price. I'll send a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 145}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $130, I'll increase the price slightly to $145, which is still lower than my minimum price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate further.
