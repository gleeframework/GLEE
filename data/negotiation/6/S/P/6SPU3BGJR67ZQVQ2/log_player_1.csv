{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong opening price, leaving room for negotiation while still being above your minimum acceptable value.  It's important to be friendly and show confidence in the product to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? This gives us both a good deal and ensures I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11500? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough to cover my costs and I would be losing money.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for $12,000 and guarantee I make at least my minimum profit."
