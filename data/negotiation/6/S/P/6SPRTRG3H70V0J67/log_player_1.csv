Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and positive.** This can help keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **The offer is clear and concise.** This makes it easy for Bob to understand. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:** $9,500 is a good starting point, potentially yielding a higher profit than John's offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial perceived value, especially if he truly wants the product.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still negotiate or sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round.  This will allow me to try and get closer to my desired price point while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair price for both of us."" This makes it less about my own gain and more about a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Reiterate interest in the deal:** I want to make it clear that I'm still interested in selling the product to Bob, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my $10,000 target.  I've made two concessions already, and I'm not sure if Bob will budge further.  To ensure I get my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee he'll come up to my price. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick, hassle-free transaction.

While I'd ideally like to get more from Bob, it's important to make the decision that maximizes my profit and minimizes risk."
