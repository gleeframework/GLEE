{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away price:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This is your ""walk-away"" price â€“ you'll never accept less.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Your goal is to go significantly above this but stay below your walk-away price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **The chosen price:** $1,300,000 leaves a significant margin for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob if the product offers him strategic advantages worth the higher price."
