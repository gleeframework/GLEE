Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to let you know that I'm getting a bit concerned about the time and potential other interested buyers. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and risking further negotiation might lead to her losing interest or another buyer swooping in. Taking the $10,000 offer is the best move to secure the product at a good price."
