"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $13,000 is tempting, the value of this product to me is quite high. Could you consider $13,750? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Can we discuss further?",13500.0,Bob,4,
