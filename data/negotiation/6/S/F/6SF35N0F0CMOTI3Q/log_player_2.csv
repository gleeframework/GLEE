Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125.
