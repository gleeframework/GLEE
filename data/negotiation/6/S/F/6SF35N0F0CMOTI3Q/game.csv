"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still only comfortable paying $10,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
