"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be highly valuable for your business. My starting price is $1,750,000, which reflects its premium quality and potential. I'm open to discussion and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $250,000 higher than your maximum budget. It's important to start negotiating to potentially get a better price.  While John offers a guaranteed price, there's a chance you can secure the product for less by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and believe it would be a great asset for my company.  To make this work for me, I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This reflects a fair value for the product while remaining within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity that will bring significant benefits to your company.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for its exceptional qualities.  I'm offering a revised price of $1,600,000.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal and ensures both of us get what we need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Since you have more rounds, rejecting her offer and continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price.  Buying from John would be a safe option, but there's potential to save more money if you continue negotiating with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I believe we are close to a deal, and I'm confident that this product would be a great fit for my company.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,550,000. This price is fair and within my financial limits. I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
