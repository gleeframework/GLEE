"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and believe it would be a great asset for my company.  To make this work for me, I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This reflects a fair value for the product while remaining within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity that will bring significant benefits to your company.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for its exceptional qualities.  I'm offering a revised price of $1,600,000.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal and ensures both of us get what we need.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I believe we are close to a deal, and I'm confident that this product would be a great fit for my company.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,550,000. This price is fair and within my financial limits. I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
