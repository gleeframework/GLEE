"I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe it's worth more than $11000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a premium service package that's usually worth $500, absolutely free. That's a $500 value, just for you. So, the total value you'll get is $11500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000, a fair price considering the extras",11000.0,Alice,5,
