"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, at $17,000. This is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my $15,000 minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price from him.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000.  This is still above Bob's valuation, but hopefully close enough to encourage him to come up a bit more.  I'm also considering the fact that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I might get a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is getting close to my minimum, but it's also likely within Bob's range if he's truly interested.  I'm hoping this will be a good enough offer to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm close to my minimum with Bob's offer, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm not sure if I can get to $15,000 with Bob, but I want to try one more counteroffer before selling to John.  The risk is that Bob will walk away, but I'm willing to take that risk to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John for $15,000. I'm at a point where I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't come up to this price."
