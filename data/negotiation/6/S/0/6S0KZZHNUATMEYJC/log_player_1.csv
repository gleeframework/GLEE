Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive and gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling pressured.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  This price allows for several rounds of negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important note:**  This is just a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds, you may need to adjust your strategy.  Be prepared to counteroffer, lower your price slightly if necessary, and even walk away if you don't feel the negotiation is fruitful.  Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's tempting to take the $950,000, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, showing potential for a deal closer to your target.

**Why this is the best strategy:**

* **Maintain your position:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss for you. 
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that you're serious about your desired price and encourages further negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, you'll need to send a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but lower than your initial offer.  Consider a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This shows you're willing to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Stay firm on your minimum:** Remember, your bottom line is $1,200,000. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob won't budge closer to that number."

Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now at your minimum acceptable value.** This is a good outcome, considering you initially wanted at least $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful.**  Bob is already at his perceived value, so pushing for more could result in a stalemate or a breakdown in negotiations.

**Why this is the best strategy:**

* **Secure a reasonable price:** Accepting the offer guarantees you a solid profit without risking losing the deal altogether.
* **Minimize risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away, forcing you to sell to John, who is willing to pay your minimum but not more. 

**Important Note:** It's always tempting to push for more, especially when you're close to your desired price. However, in this scenario, accepting the offer ensures a successful sale at a price that is still profitable and valuable to you."
