Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This makes the offer attractive to Bob, increasing the chance of a deal.
* **It's above your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still counteroffer without going too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $110? This would still give you a great deal on a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $105 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I would prefer to get closer to $110, accepting this offer is still a profitable deal.  It's a good balance between getting a reasonable price and potentially losing the deal altogether if I continue to reject offers."
