"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $15000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is also for $15,000, it's not advantageous to accept her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave the possibility open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her later."
