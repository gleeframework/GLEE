"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's try to work something out.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $825,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to make a deal. How about $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
