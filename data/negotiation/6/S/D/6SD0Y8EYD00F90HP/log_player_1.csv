{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I believe it has tremendous value for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I value a quick deal,  $950,000 is too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,100,000.  This price is still fair and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more,  $1,025,000 is a good price and secures the deal. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or going through more rounds of negotiations."
