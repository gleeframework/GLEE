"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. My initial offer for the product is $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. My revised offer is $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  While it's closer, Bob can likely negotiate a better price by continuing to counteroffer. Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm already paying above my initial target. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next offer is $885,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above it. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has already made a counteroffer. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  It's likely that Alice will be willing to come down further in the next round to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to pay $870,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. My next offer is $880,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  While the negotiations are getting closer, Bob has only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will drop her price to his target.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price, saving him time and potentially a lot of money."
