"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I understand the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $787,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",787500.0,Alice,5,
