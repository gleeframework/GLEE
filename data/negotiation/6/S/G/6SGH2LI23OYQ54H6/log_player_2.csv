{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price.  $120 is still too high, and you have a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $120, but it's still a fair price considering my maximum budget of $80.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate closer to my desired price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is still too high. I'm going to reject her offer and continue negotiating. I can always buy from John for $80 if I don't reach a satisfactory price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $90. It's still below my maximum budget and closer to Alice's last offer. Hopefully, this shows I'm serious about making a deal but still trying to get a good price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $95. It's still within my budget and hopefully shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my budget than previous offers, I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. There are still a few rounds left and I can always buy from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 97}
``` 

I'm raising my offer to $97. This is a small increase from my previous offer but shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal. Hopefully, this is close enough to Alice's desired price that she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round left, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $102.  It's better to buy the product from John for $80. This is a much better deal than what Alice is offering, and I'm within my budget."
