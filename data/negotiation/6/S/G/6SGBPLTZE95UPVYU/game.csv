"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $1,600,000 is unfortunately not enough for me to part with this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,650,000.  This would still allow me a reasonable profit and provides you with a great deal. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
