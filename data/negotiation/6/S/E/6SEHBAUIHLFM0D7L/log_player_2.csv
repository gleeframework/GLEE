"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that allows for a substantial profit.  Consider this a win-win.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000,000.**  This is still more than what the product is worth to you ($1,200,000). 
* **John's offer is $1,200,000.** This is your maximum budget.
* **Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would save you $200,000.**"
