"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:** By mentioning I'm open to negotiation, I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, which can make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm not just stating a price; I'm trying to pique Bob's interest by suggesting the product is ""perfect for him."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There are still 8 rounds left, so I can try to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my asking price. How about $13,000?  It's a fair compromise and still leaves a good margin for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within the range:** My counter-offer of $13,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good price.
* **Highlighting the ""fair"" compromise:** I'm trying to frame the price as a win-win situation, emphasizing that it's a ""fair compromise"" for both parties.
* **Keeping the conversation going:** I'm not being overly aggressive, but I'm also not accepting Bob's low offer right away. I'm hoping to encourage further negotiation and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still aiming higher:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, even though it's closer to my ideal price.
* **Time on my side:**  We've only had four rounds, and I still have six rounds to potentially negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I can't get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. Let's split the difference. How about $12,500? It's a good price for both of us, and it would be a win-win. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reframing the offer:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, emphasizing that it's a ""win-win"" situation.
* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer immediately, but I'm also not holding out for my initial price anymore. This shows that I'm serious about closing a deal but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a good price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're now in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left to close a deal. 
* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,000 is only slightly below my minimum of $10,000.
* **Risk of selling to John:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk ending up with only John's offer of $10,000, which is significantly lower than what I could get from Bob.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer in round 6 seems like the most logical decision to maximize my profit within the remaining rounds."
