"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room:**  This gives me space to negotiate down if needed, while also demonstrating that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm aiming for a deal, $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I have 9 rounds left. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I haven't exhausted all options yet, and there's a chance I can secure a higher price through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  The product holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to achieve my goals, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm rejecting Bob's initial offer but presenting a counteroffer that's closer to his price while still being higher than my minimum threshold.
* **Compromise:** I'm indicating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, showcasing flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm prompting Bob to consider the counteroffer and engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a way to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:** We've only had 4 rounds, and I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. This gives me more time to potentially secure a better price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I believe there's still a chance to get closer to that amount with Bob. There's value in exploring the negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your position, and while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but still pushing for a higher price. The $1,200,000 offer is a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the benefits of the deal for both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to see the value in my counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** I'm moving closer to Bob's desired price while staying above my minimum threshold, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal before I have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We've reached round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **No Significant Progress:**  Despite multiple rounds of negotiation, Bob's offer has remained at $1,100,000. This shows his resistance to moving up significantly.
* **Guaranteed Deal with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and significantly closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he won't budge and I might end up accepting his offer, which is far below my desired price.

Considering the limited rounds left and the risk of getting a lower price from Bob, selling to John now offers a safer and more profitable outcome."
