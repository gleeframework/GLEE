"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  The product holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to achieve my goals, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a way to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear your position, and while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a deal before I have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
