"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
