"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to start high and see what kind of response I get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $135. This is still above my minimum, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a little bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$110 is below my minimum, and while I could sell to John, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $125. This is only $5 above my minimum and shows him I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, we can close the deal at this price."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay my minimum.  I've already gone down to $125, and he's still offering a price I can't accept. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
