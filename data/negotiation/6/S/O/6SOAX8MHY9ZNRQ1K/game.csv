"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's something I know you'll find extremely valuable. My initial asking price is $1,750,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This is a fair price given the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is a bit below what I'm looking to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $1,550,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and allows us to finalize the transaction. What do you think?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
