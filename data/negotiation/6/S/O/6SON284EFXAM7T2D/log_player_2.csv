"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. As Bob, I aim to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,050,000 is still higher than my ideal price. I'm not desperate and have other options. Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation moving towards my goal of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to close the deal at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can agree on this number."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her $1,025,000 offer, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. While I'd love to get it for $1,000,000, $1,025,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John at $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product while saving a significant amount. There's a chance my counteroffers might get rejected again, and time is running out."
