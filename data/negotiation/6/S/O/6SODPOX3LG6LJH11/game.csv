"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your top budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
