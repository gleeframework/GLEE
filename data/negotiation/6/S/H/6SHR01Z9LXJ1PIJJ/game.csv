"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $12,000 is too far below my asking price. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This price still reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,250. Can we discuss further?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm open to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. Would you consider $14,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,750, which is halfway between our last offers.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal today. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I need to get as close to my target of $10,000 as possible. Can you consider $13,500 or even lower?",13500.0,Bob,8,
