Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a good price and me to secure a fair return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $100,000 gap between my asking price and Bob's perceived value gives him a sense of potential savings and incentivizes him to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the benefits for both of us, fostering a collaborative tone rather than a confrontational one. 
* **Flexibility:**  This offer allows me to accept a lower price if necessary, but also allows me to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000? I think it's a fair compromise that would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $1,000,000. This provides me with a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm not significantly deviating from my initial offer, indicating that I'm serious about getting a fair price for my product.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $825,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $825,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  At this point, it seems like further negotiation with Bob will only lead to more concessions on my part.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John than to continue negotiations with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
