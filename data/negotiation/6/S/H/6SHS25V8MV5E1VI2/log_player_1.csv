"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept immediately. This sets a strong starting point and allows room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is still a significant profit, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I have 9 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,000,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's enticing enough for Bob to consider.  I'm trying to find a price point that balances my need for a good profit with the possibility of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my target of $1,000,000. It's a good profit, and I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate, I might end up getting a worse offer or having to sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'm going to accept this offer to secure the deal."
