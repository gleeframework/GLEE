Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob might not value it as highly.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You make a profit of $500,000 over your minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
