Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,500?  I think that's a fair offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still quite low considering what you're getting.  How about we settle at $14,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a firm budget.  I can offer you $12,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob is unlikely to budge from his $12,000 offer, and it's clear he won't meet my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
