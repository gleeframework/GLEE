"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within his budget. He's offering a price that's significantly less than Alice's initial offer, but still more than Alice's floor price.  This sets the stage for negotiation and shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high for Bob, but it's getting closer to his target. Rejecting and countering again allows for further negotiation, potentially leading to a more favorable price. Bob is still willing to negotiate further because he has a higher price point from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still significantly less than Alice's latest offer, but it demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet halfway. He's still trying to get the best price possible, but also recognizes that he needs to be realistic in his negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget. While it's still not his ideal price,  it's becoming too risky to keep rejecting and countering.  There's a good chance Alice will become less willing to negotiate further, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's still within his budget and saves him from potential risk in further negotiation."
