"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, while John wants $12,000. 
* **You can save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **The product is worth more to you:** Even at $10,000, the product is still worth more to you than it is to Alice ($8,000). This means you are getting a good deal."
