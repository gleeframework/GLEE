Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's space for him to counteroffer without you having to accept a price below your minimum.
* **It shows you're confident in the value of your product:**  By starting at a slightly higher price, you convey that you believe in the value of what you're selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $12,000 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is your minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is at the very bottom of that range. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  By rejecting and counteroffering, you maintain the possibility of earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** It shows Bob that you're open to compromise and aren't simply holding out for your initial asking price. 
* **Is still profitable for you:**  $13,000 is still above your minimum, so you're still earning more than you would if you sold to John.
* **Leaves room for a possible final deal:** There's still space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. Could you possibly reconsider coming down to $12,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Here's why selling to John is the best decision at this point:

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $12,000.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, your minimum. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more counteroffers and delays, potentially losing time and ultimately ending up at the same price. 

It's important to recognize that while a higher price with Bob is ideal, securing the guaranteed $12,000 from John ensures you don't lose out on the deal altogether."
