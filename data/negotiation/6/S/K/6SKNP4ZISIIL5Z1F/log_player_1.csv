Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring the deal is still attractive enough for him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price significantly higher than our backup offer from John ($800,000). 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** Offering it at $1,300,000 gives Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright if he finds it too high. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer in this scenario."
