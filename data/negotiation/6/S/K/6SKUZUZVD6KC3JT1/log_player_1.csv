{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    * Still attractive to Bob, as it represents a $150,000 saving compared to us selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer. We can then adjust our approach based on his response, potentially negotiating down towards his perceived value while remaining above our guaranteed sale price."
