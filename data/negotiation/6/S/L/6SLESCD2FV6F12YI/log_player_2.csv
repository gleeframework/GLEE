"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. You have a better option with John, so rejecting Alice's offer and moving to a counteroffer makes sense. You'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you have a fallback option if that fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going straight for my maximum budget of $80.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it establishes my price point and sets the stage for negotiation.  It's a bold move, but it's the most advantageous for me in the long run."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my budget, I'm still better off rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate. I can still potentially get the product for $80 from John, and I've already shown Alice my bottom line. By rejecting her offer, I'm showing that I'm serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $90. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a significant discount from her original price. I'm hoping that she will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to budge much further. While $110 is better than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to stick with my plan and purchase the product from John for $80. This ensures I stay within my budget and avoid further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better deal."
