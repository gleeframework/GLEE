"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $12000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

* **It's within your budget:** Your maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 
* **You're still saving:** You're getting the product for $500 less than your alternative."
