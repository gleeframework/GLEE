"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your interest.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,125,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
