"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $8000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $8,000. Alice is offering it for $10,000.  This is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $8,000.  Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer."
