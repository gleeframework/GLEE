"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $12,000. I believe this is a great value considering the product's quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to purchase the product for $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, aiming to get as close to Alice's minimum price as possible without immediately going too low and risking a stalemate.  This offer leaves some room for negotiation and signals Bob's serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise at $11,250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge or that they'll run out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
