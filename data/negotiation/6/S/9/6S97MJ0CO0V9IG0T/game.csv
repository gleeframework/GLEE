"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit too high.  Let's try $130 - it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a little below what I need to make this worth my while.  How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
