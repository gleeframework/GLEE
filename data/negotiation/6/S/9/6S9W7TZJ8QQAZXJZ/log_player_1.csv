Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his ""final offer."" While we could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance he won't budge much higher. At this point, we've reached a point where the potential gain from continuing with Bob (an uncertain amount above $800,000) is outweighed by the guaranteed $800,000 John is offering. It's a safer bet to take John's offer."
