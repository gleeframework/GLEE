"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm open to discussing this price, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's important to negotiate and bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start with a strong stance in negotiations. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of your $8,000 maximum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates willingness to discuss the price further, making it clear that this is not a ""take it or leave it"" offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down from her initial offer, $14,000 is still considerably higher than your target price and what John is offering. It's important to show Alice that you're serious about a lower price point.  You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be fair, I can increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Showing willingness to increase your offer demonstrates good faith and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Firm but Fair:** The increase is significant enough to encourage Alice to continue negotiating but still well below both her asking price and John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating it's a strong offer and hoping for a deal, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency without resorting to ultimatums."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $12,000  - which is the lowest I can go. This is a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her ""final offer.""  It doesn't necessarily mean she won't budge, and you still have room to negotiate.
* **Knowing Your Limit:**  While $12,000 is closer to your limit, you're aiming to save as much as possible. There's no harm in seeing if you can get closer to $8,000, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but $12,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  That's a very fair offer, considering it's a significant amount above my alternative option.  Let me know if you're open to this."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Offering $10,000 is a significant move towards Alice's $12,000, making it a strong counter-proposal.
* **Mentioning Your Alternative:**  By subtly referencing John's offer, you remind Alice you have other options without resorting to threats.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  Phrasing like ""meet you halfway"" and ""very fair offer"" encourages Alice to find a mutually agreeable solution."
