"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm open to discussing this price, so feel free to share your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 to make this work.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be fair, I can increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to accept $12,000  - which is the lowest I can go. This is a final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but $12,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  That's a very fair offer, considering it's a significant amount above my alternative option.  Let me know if you're open to this.",10000.0,Bob,6,
