Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value beyond the market estimations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
