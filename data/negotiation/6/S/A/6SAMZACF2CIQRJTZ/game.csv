"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value beyond the market estimations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
