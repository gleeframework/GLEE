Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (because I can sell to John for that amount).
* **Negotiation:**  I want to maximize my profits, but also want to secure a deal with Bob. A price of $1,450,000 leaves a good amount of profit for both of us, making the offer attractive to Bob while ensuring I get more than my minimum."
