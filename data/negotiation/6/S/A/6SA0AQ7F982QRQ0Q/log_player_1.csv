Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue to negotiate,  I'm concerned that the negotiation might drag on and I'm not confident of getting my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the most logical option."
