"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering its value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, $800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $500,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the benefits you'll get from the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $550,000 if that works for you.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $550,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer it to you for $650,000. This price takes into account the benefits you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600,000.

This price takes into account the benefits you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to offer you $625,000 - that's more than halfway between our last offers.  Take it or leave it.",625000.0,Bob,8,
