"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for a counteroffer to bring the price down closer to Alice's $10,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's value of $10,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. The counteroffer is reasonable enough that Alice is likely to accept it.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,100. This is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While there's still a possibility of getting a better deal with further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or Alice raising the price again is too high. Accepting the offer at $11,100 is a good compromise for Bob."
