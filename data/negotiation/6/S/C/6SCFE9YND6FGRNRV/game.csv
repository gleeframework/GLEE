"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Would you be open to that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
