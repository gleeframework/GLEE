"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. It also sets a clear expectation of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a more realistic price point considering Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to see if I can squeeze out a better price in the next round.  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a compromise, coming closer to Bob's last offer, but still exceeding my minimum. With only 5 rounds left, I need to strike a balance between securing a decent profit and risking losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite at my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can secure a price closer to my desired value in the next round. I have only four rounds left, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1220000}
```

I'm offering $1,220,000. This is just above my minimum and a small concession to Bob's previous offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a good deal and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high. While $1,175,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. To ensure I secure a sale and meet my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
