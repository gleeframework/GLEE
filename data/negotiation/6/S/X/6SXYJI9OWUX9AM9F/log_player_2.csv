"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price either by:

* **Negotiating with Alice:**  Bob can counteroffer with a lower price, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. 
* **Negotiating with John:**  Bob can try to get John to lower his price.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains leverage and increases the chance of getting a better deal."
