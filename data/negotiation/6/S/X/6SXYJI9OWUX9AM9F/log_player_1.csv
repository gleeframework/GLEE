Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it slightly below that at $14,000 gives him an incentive to buy while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's no risk of going lower than that. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is concise and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
