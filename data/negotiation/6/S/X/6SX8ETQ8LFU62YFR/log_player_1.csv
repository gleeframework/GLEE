Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's less than my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation.  I'll sell to John and avoid wasting time."
