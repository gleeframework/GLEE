"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'm considering the offer.

Since Alice is willing to sell the product for $119, which is $1 less than her value, I'll try to negotiate further. However, since I have the option to buy it from John for $100, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer for now.
