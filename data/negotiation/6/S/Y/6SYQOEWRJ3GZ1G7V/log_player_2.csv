"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you while still exceeding my minimum price. I understand if this price isn't agreeable, but I'm confident it's a fair offer. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's within your budget:**  The $1,200,000 price is well below your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
