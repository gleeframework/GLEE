"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? That's still a great deal for a product like this, and it gives us both something to work with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about $95? That's the lowest I can go",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $95 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
