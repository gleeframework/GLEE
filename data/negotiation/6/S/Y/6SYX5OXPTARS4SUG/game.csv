"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8500 at this time.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $12000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for in this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, $14000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firm at $10000. This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",13000.0,Alice,7,
