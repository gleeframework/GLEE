Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still remaining above your minimum price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. You don't want to go below that price with Bob.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, making it more likely Bob will take the offer seriously."
