"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget.  While it's tempting to accept, there's a good chance you can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $675,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $500,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $675,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $600,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 600000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $650,000, which is within my budget and getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of her becoming less flexible or the negotiation dragging on.  At this point, accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price and saves me from further negotiation."
