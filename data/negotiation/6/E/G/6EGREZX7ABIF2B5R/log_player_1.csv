"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for compromise. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired $1,500,000 as possible within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price and I believe I can do better.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John, as his offer is more attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I have 4 rounds left and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, I'm starting to get concerned about running out of time, so I'm going to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but we're running out of time and it's unlikely we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can secure a price closer to my target. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a successful transaction."
