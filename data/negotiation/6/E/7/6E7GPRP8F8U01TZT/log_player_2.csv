{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $750,000 is a good price, but there's a chance I can get it for even less. I'll see what counteroffers I can get."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive counteroffer of $500,000.  This will give us a good starting point for negotiation.  I think there's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit from her initial offer."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not convinced this is the best deal.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."

I'll increase my offer slightly to $550,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get a better price. Hopefully, she'll accept this counteroffer."

Alice's offer is getting higher, which is a sign she's becoming more determined.  I'm not convinced this is the best deal yet, and I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  While I'd still prefer a lower price,  $700,000 is a reasonable deal, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity altogether.  I'll accept Alice's offer and move forward with the purchase."
