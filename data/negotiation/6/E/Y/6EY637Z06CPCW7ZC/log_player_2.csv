This exceptional item not only boasts unparalleled quality but also comes with a comprehensive set of features that cater to a wide range of needs. Given its unique value proposition and the attention to detail put into its creation, we believe it's worth more than $10000 to us. However, for the sake of negotiation, let me propose an offer of $15000 for this remarkable product. We're confident that you'll find its benefits to be well worth the investment. Looking forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $15,000, the same price John is willing to sell it for.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
