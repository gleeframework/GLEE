"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000?  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair return on my investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1200000 is my maximum budget. I'd love to make a deal at this price. Can you meet me here?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1200000 just doesn't cover the value I'm offering.  I'm willing to make one final concession. If you're truly serious about purchasing, let's meet in the middle at $1275000. This is my best and final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1275000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. Please consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
