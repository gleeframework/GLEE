"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000, considering the value this product brings. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $11,000. My maximum budget remains at $10,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
