"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This is still a great price for a product you value at $80, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, and offer you the product for $82. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider accepting.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $79?",79.0,Bob,6,
