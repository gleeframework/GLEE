"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product is good but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, my absolute max budget is $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
