Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

At this point, Alice has met your ideal price. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from her, and John's offer is also $10,000. It's best to accept and close the deal."
