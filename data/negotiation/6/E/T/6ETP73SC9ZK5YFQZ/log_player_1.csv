Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net.  This allows for a bolder offer to Bob."
