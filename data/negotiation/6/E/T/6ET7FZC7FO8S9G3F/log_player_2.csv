"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than her own valuation ($12,000), it's still less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
