"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's aiming for a price closer to $8,000 and has 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $8,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. I think it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's very close to his target price of $8,000, and with several rounds remaining, he has room to keep negotiating. He should see if he can push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I see the value in the product,  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,100.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,300. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his target price, he still has a few rounds left to negotiate. If he rejects, he can potentially push Alice down to his desired $8,000 price point.  It's worth the risk to see if he can secure the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $8,300 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,050, which is my final offer. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8050}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,050. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its worth to me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's only got one round left, and Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,200.  While he's very close to his target, it's better to secure the product for $8,000 from John and avoid the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice."
