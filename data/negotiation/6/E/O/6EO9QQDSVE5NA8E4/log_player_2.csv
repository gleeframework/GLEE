"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a valuable piece and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  My message emphasizes that I'm interested in the product but need a price that works for me.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my budget limit than John's alternative offer of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving:**  Alice has come down in price, which is a good sign. 
* **Still above John:** However, her offer is still higher than what John is offering. 
* **Room to negotiate:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to John's price or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?"",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly halfway between her last offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($8,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Below John, above budget:** This keeps the negotiation alive while staying somewhat competitive with John's standing offer. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  As we progress through the rounds, I'll need to inch closer to either accepting her offer or taking John's deal."
