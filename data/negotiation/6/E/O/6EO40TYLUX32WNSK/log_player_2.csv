Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a move in the right direction, it's worth trying to push for a lower price."

Alice is still too high, and it's unlikely she'll budge further. John is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, so it's the best option."
