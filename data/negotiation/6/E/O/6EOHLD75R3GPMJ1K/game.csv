"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This is a fantastic deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $140 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $125 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference and go with $132.50. This is a good deal for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this quickly.",132.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. $132.50 is very close, but I'm trying to stay under $130.  How about $128?",128.0,Bob,6,
