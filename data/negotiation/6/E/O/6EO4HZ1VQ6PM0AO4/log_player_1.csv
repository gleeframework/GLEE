"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still more than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,750,000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price and hopefully a reasonable compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously low. While $1,500,000 from John is tempting, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer again, but I'll need to be careful about how much I lower my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,400,000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. It's a risky move, as Bob might reject it and force me to accept John's offer, but it's my best chance at getting a price closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offers are getting increasingly low, and I'm worried that if I continue negotiating, I won't be able to reach a price that meets my minimum requirement. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
