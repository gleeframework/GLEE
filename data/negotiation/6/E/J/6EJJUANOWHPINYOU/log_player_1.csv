* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's unique worth to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If he rejects, I'll consider whether to lower my price or keep pushing for my desired price. 
* If he makes a counteroffer, I'll evaluate if it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer. 
* I'll always keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as my floor price."
