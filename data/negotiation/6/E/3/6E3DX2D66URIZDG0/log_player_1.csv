Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than our minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong alternative buyer (John) willing to pay our desired price, giving us leverage in the negotiation with Bob. We don't need to be desperate for Bob's acceptance.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale to Bob, you might adjust the offered price."
