"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to buy it for $8500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target. How about $8750?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take $8,750, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $9,000.  We're already in round 4, and I'm not sure how much more Bob is willing to pay.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really determined to get a good deal, and I admire that. However, $8,750 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 8900}
