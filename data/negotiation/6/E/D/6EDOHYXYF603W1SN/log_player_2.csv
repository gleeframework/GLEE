"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if I can push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant discount, but I'm still offering a price that's above Alice's minimum.  This is a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a lower price, but I want to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counter again, hoping to close the gap further.  I'm not yet in a position where I'd consider buying from John, as I believe I can get a more favorable deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to inch closer to Alice's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price below $925,000.  I'm confident that this price is fair, and I'm hoping Alice will see it as a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $920,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we are now very close to my desired price. While I could try to push for a lower price, I'm concerned about the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's likely that Alice won't come down further, and I could end up having to buy from John for a much higher price. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
