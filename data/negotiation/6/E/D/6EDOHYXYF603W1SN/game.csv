"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, I'm going to need to see a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $920,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",920000.0,Alice,5,
