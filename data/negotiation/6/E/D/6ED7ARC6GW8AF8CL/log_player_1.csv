Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves room for you to lower the price if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more amicable negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale. This offer sets the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Selling to John guarantees you a much better outcome.  However, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8500? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Maximize Profit:** While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that you'll get a higher offer from Bob.
* **Secure the Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away completely.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiations would require more time and effort. 

While you wouldn't be getting your full desired price, $8,500 is a good compromise and a more profitable outcome than selling to John for $12,000."
