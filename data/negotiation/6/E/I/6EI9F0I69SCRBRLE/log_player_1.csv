**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $14,500 gives Bob a potential savings of $500, making it more likely he'll accept. This price also nets you a significant profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,500. He might try to negotiate a lower price. However, starting with a strong initial offer gives you a good position in the negotiation."
