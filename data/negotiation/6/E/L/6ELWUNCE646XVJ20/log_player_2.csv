As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,200,000, you are still buying the product for less than what it's worth to you ($1,500,000).

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money while still getting the product."
