"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a significant sum, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a compromise that meets me halfway, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $780,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to reach a final agreement that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $820,000. This is a more moderate adjustment than my last offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob while still leaving me with a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.  While $790,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not confident I can reach a higher price within the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a secure deal."
