"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
