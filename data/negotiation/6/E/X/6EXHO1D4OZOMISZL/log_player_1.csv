Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially earning a good profit.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message can help establish rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Open ended question:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I encourage Bob to respond and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial ask, it shows he's interested. I can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, but it's a missed opportunity to potentially earn more through negotiation with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation open and have the potential to achieve a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows flexibility and willingness to reach a deal.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open ended question:**  I'm asking for his opinion to encourage him to accept or make a final counteroffer.

This strategy aims to reach a mutually agreeable price while ensuring I get closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of getting stuck in a price war and potentially ending up with an even lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a safe and secure outcome.

While I would prefer to maximize my earnings, the risk associated with further negotiation with Bob is too high. Selling to John ensures a profitable and guaranteed outcome."
