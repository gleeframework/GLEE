# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you with a considerable gain.

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price.  While buying from John is a safe option, I can potentially save more by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
