"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you with a considerable gain.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a fair compromise and give us both a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
