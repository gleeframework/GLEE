Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he outright rejects this high price, it suggests he's looking for a significantly lower number. If he counters, it indicates a willingness to negotiate within a certain range. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You can afford to be more assertive in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your asking price and your fallback option with John.  There's room for negotiation.  You'll counter to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you with a considerable gain."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This is a common negotiation tactic, aiming for a compromise that feels fair to both parties.
* **Highlighting Value:**  By reiterating the product's ""true value,"" you subtly remind Bob that he's getting a good deal even at this price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps you above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000) while still leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob comes back with another counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a fair compromise and give us both a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,400,000 is still below your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll reach your desired price point. It makes more financial sense to accept the sure thing with John."
