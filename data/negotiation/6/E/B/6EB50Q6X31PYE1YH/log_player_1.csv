"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value. I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where both Bob and I benefit from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175. This price is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value. While it's tempting to get a deal done, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $160. This shows I'm serious about negotiating a deal with Bob, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my value. Hopefully, this will be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to take such a significant loss.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150.  This ensures I at least get my minimum value."
