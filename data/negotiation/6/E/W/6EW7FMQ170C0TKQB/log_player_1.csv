Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and leaves room for potential negotiation. It also reflects the value the product holds for Bob ($1,500,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still lower than my desired price point and leaves room for further negotiation.  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my previous offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired price point. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,150,000.  This is a compromise that keeps me closer to my desired price point, but also acknowledges Bob's decreasing offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there. I've already made several concessions, and it's possible that he's not willing to go higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale."
