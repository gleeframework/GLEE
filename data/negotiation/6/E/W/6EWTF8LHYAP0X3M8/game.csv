"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
