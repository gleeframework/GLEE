"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is better than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  It's closer to my minimum, but I think I can get a bit more by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the value you'd get."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal at $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for the value you'll be getting. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $8900 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob. He's not budging much further, and I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John for $8,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
