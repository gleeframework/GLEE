"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  How does $11,500 sound?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is under your $12,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from what the product is worth to her ($10,000). By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or proceed with buying from John at $12,000."
