"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me though. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're beginning significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range. This leaves room to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone is essential for successful negotiations, even when pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down a lot, $85 is still above your $80 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, especially since you've shown you're serious about buying by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. Would you be willing to do $75? That's a fair price for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer moves closer to Alice's price while still staying within a reasonable distance of your budget.
* **Justification:** By stating a ""fair price for me,"" you are subtly emphasizing your budget limitations without being confrontational. 
* **Keeping it Moving:**  The negotiation is progressing, and each offer is getting closer to a potential agreement."
