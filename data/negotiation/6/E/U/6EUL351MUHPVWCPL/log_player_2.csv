{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You have 10 rounds.** There's plenty of time to negotiate a better price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to set the tone.**  By rejecting, you show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

You will now send Alice a counteroffer. Your goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you."

* **Leaving room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to come down a bit without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will reveal Alice's willingness to negotiate and give you a better understanding of her bottom line."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

* **Still within your budget:** $750,000 is comfortably within your budget of $1,500,000, leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to move closer to your desired price point and reveal if she's open to further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're making progress:**  Alice is steadily decreasing her asking price, showing she's open to negotiation.  
* **Don't rush into a bad deal:** You have five rounds left, and there's still room to secure a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:** This counteroffer is exactly Alice's minimum acceptable price. This signals your commitment to reaching an agreement while staying within your budget.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will determine if Alice is truly committed to selling at her minimum price or if she's willing to compromise slightly.
* **Strategic positioning:** This move puts pressure on Alice to accept or counter with a very slight increase. It allows you to potentially secure a deal at her minimum, saving you significant money. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Alice's response.** If she accepts, you've successfully secured the product at a favorable price. 
* **Prepare to counter slightly:** If she rejects, prepare to increase your offer marginally, perhaps to $825,000, to see if you can reach a compromise.
* **Don't overextend:** Remember, you still have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000.  Don't let your desire to save money lead to a deal that's too risky or unfavorable."
