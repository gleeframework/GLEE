"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
