Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, as it's still significantly lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,250. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin for myself. I believe this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, given his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my counteroffer and just slightly below my target price. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $8,000.  Given the potential for further negotiation to be time-consuming and uncertain, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice."
