"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
