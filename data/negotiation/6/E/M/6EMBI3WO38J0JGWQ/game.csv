"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your perspective on the value.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,
