It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice.  $14,000 is a good price, but there's always room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

Let's see if we can get Alice down to $13,000. It's still a good price for me, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate."

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price considering my maximum budget is $15,000.  I'm happy to take this deal and avoid further negotiation."
