Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **John as a Guarantee:** We have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy:**

We start with a strong opening offer of $1,350,000. This price is:

* **Significantly above Bob's value:** It gives us room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Below our guaranteed price:** It still ensures a profit even if we need to come down slightly. 

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
