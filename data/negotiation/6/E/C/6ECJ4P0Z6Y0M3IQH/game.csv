"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However,  $10,200 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,600?",9600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",10500.0,Alice,5,
