Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $115 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to his perceived value.
* **Considering John:** You always have the option to sell to John for $100, so any offer Bob makes below that is automatically unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is more than your minimum acceptable price ($100), it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and closer to your minimum. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aiming for a higher price and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $110, we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and encourages him to do the same.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** $110 is still a profitable price for you (a $10 profit) and keeps the negotiation above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Urgency:** While we haven't explicitly mentioned John in this counter-offer, remember that he represents your ""walk-away"" point. If Bob doesn't budge significantly in the next round, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $108? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $108 is still a profitable one for you, yielding an $8 profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two more. At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation is probably not worth the risk of Bob walking away or the additional time and effort involved.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting this offer shows Bob you're willing to compromise and be fair, which can be good for future interactions."
