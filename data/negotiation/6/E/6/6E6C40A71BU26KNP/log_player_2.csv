"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum valuation. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a respectful and open tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Target Price in Mind:** While the initial offer is $800,000, remember your goal is to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $800,000 is far below what this product is truly worth. To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $950,000. This would allow us both to reach a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price range, which indicates there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** There's a significant gap between her offer ($950,000) and your previous counteroffer ($800,000).  A counteroffer might encourage her to meet you closer to the middle ground.
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you have John as a backup option, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $875,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while still being a good deal for you."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($950,000) and your previous offer ($800,000), showing willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** By stating your reasoning  (reflecting value while being a good deal) you provide a stronger case for Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer positions you well for the final stages of negotiation.  If Alice rejects it, you can likely make a final offer very close to your $1,000,000 maximum without risking losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This price acknowledges your budget while still reflecting the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice's offer of $925,000 is within your acceptable range and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer ($1,000,000).
* **Risk of Pushing Further:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge much more, and you could miss out on securing the product at a good price.
* **Successful Negotiation:** You've successfully negotiated a discount of $75,000 from Alice's initial asking price. 

It's generally a good idea to accept a price you're comfortable with, especially when it falls within your predetermined acceptable range."
