"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's truly interested in buying.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible without losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground. I believe this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I am not willing to settle yet.  I can still potentially get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm offering $1,500,000, which is my minimum value.  This should be a good compromise and hopefully, Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not getting closer to my minimum value, and I am confident that I can sell to John for a much better price. I am now choosing to end negotiations with Bob and accept John's offer."
