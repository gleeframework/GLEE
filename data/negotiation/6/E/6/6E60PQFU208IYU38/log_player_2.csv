Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we've been able to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This is a fair price that should work for both of us.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000. Accepting at $1,012,500 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
