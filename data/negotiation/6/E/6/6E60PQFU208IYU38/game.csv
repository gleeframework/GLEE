"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000? This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation.  $1,025,000 is still a little rich for me.  How about we make this the final offer - $1,000,000 and we have a deal.  Otherwise, I think I'll have to go with another option.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we've been able to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
