"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? That gives you a good price, and allows me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about $1,050,000? This is a good middle ground, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
