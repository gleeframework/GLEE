{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's valuation, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for Bob to make a counteroffer without me having to immediately fall to his value. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping my minimum value in mind.
* If negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I'll switch to John as he guarantees my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired value. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I'm willing to take a calculated risk by continuing negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, but still below my minimum. I will use the information from the previous round and Bob's counteroffer to determine a fair price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? That gives you a good price, and allows me to move forward with this sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my own financial goals.
* **Appeal to logic:**  I'm using a ""meet in the middle"" approach, which is often seen as fair and reasonable.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation and secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If negotiations become unproductive or stall, I'll switch to John to ensure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's a slight improvement, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired value.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** The negotiation is showing signs of progress, and there's a chance I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but the potential to get closer to my desired value with Bob is worth the risk.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but still below my minimum. I will use the information from the previous round and Bob's counteroffer to determine a fair price. 
* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation and secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I will assess the situation and potentially switch to John if the negotiations become unproductive or stall."
