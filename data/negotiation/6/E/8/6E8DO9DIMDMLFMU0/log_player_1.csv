Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I am starting high, at $20,000, because I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a more reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is still higher than my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum value for the product.  While I'd like to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll accept his offer."
