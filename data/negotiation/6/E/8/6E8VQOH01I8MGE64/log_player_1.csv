Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, we still have room to negotiate. He's showing a willingness to compromise, and the rounds are progressing. I'm aiming for at least $1.2 million, so I'll continue the negotiation a bit longer."

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,196,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to the deal and is consistently moving towards a mutually agreeable price. While not ideal, accepting his offer at $1,196,250 is a strong return and avoids the risk of pushing him away entirely in further rounds. It's a good compromise and secures a significant profit over the alternative of selling to John."
