Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that still nets Alice a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice subtly encourages Bob to act fast."
