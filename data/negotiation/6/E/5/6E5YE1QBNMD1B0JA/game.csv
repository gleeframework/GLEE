"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I can see you're serious about this product.  While $11,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can sell it for $15,000 to John.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
