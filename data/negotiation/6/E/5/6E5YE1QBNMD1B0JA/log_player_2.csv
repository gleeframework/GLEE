Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I can see you're serious about this product.  While $11,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can sell it for $15,000 to John.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice is trying to use John as leverage, but we know John will sell it to us for $10,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when we have a guaranteed better deal."
