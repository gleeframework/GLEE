Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,250 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is at Bob's maximum budget, showing Alice that he's serious about making a deal.
* It's also just a small amount less than Alice's offer, showing that Bob is willing to be reasonable and compromise.
* By stating it's his absolute limit, Bob adds pressure on Alice to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your absolute limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $8100. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
*  While it's only $100 more, Bob has already made it clear that $8,000 is his limit.
* There's a high chance that continuing to negotiate with Alice will lead to a stalemate.
* Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees Bob gets the product at his maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
