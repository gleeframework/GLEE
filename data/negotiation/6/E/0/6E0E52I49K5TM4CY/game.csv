"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary considerations, but your offer is quite a bit below what I can accept.  This product offers significant value, which is reflected in my pricing.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I think this is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,000,000. However, I believe you would benefit greatly from this product, and I'd prefer to see it in your hands. My final offer is $1,075,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a firm offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty about the other interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,075,000, so I'll offer $1,037,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",1037500.0,Bob,6,
