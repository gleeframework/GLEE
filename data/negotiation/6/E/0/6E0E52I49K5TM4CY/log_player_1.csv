"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Using phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""a fair starting point for us to discuss"" signals my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to engage Bob in a negotiation that could last several rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary considerations, but your offer is quite a bit below what I can accept.  This product offers significant value, which is reflected in my pricing.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but clearly state it's unacceptable.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's value to subtly counter his lowball offer. 
* **Significant Concession:** I've come down $50,000, a substantial move to signal flexibility but not desperation. 
* **Compromise Language:**  By framing the new price as a ""compromise,"" I encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $950,000? I think this is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, it's still below John's guaranteed offer. I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob. I have a few more rounds to potentially bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at $1,000,000. However, I believe you would benefit greatly from this product, and I'd prefer to see it in your hands. My final offer is $1,075,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a firm offer."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Deadline:** I'm introducing John's offer as leverage, creating a sense of urgency and limiting Bob's time to negotiate.
* **Finality:** Labeling this as my ""final offer"" signals my seriousness and limits further lowballing attempts.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the benefit to Bob, emphasizing the value he gains while justifying the price.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  The offer splits the difference between his last offer and John's, showing significant movement on my part while still leaving room for a small profit above my fallback option.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a decision while maintaining a price that's advantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the other interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,075,000, so I'll offer $1,037,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,037,500 is a reasonable compromise and exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
