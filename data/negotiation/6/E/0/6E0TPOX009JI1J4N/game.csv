"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a good compromise and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
