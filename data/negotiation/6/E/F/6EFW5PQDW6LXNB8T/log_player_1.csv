Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $18,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This feels like a good compromise - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your confidence in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $13,500 is a reasonable profit above my minimum ($12,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away altogether in later rounds."
