Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is a risky move, but it's the best way to maximize my potential profit. 

If Bob rejects, I can then consider John's offer and avoid any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is still a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that's still above Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to his valuation of the product. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to reach an agreement without me needing to resort to John's offer."
