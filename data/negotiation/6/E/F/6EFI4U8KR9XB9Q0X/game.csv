"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $60 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $120?  This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $80 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us and ensures you get a great product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. However, $90 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile. Would you consider $105? That's a fair compromise, and you'd still be getting a great product at a great price.",105.0,Alice,7,
