"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's close the deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  However, $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8875. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
