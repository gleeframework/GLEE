"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is charging, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's original offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target price of $9,500."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try to split the difference. I'm ready to offer $10,250 for the product.  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 10250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try 10750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Bob is getting a good deal:**  $10,750 is still well below the $15,000 price from John. 
* **Potential for more negotiation is limited:**  Continuing to reject offers might lead to a stalemate or Alice getting frustrated. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point. It provides a good deal while avoiding the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
