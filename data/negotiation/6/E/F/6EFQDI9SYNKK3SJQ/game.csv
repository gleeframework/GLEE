"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try to split the difference. I'm ready to offer $10250 for the product.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 10250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try 10750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
