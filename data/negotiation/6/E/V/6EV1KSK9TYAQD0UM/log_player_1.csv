Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me, and you'll be getting a high-quality product at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob values the product at, leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that it's a good deal for him.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation and counteroffers, showing I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option, ensuring I can achieve my minimum desired price if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer, always mindful of my minimum desired price and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price I've researched. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Although Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I can still potentially reach a mutually agreeable price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum desired price, so I have a strong backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. My counteroffer will be higher than $950,000 but lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to compromise while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the price as fair considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. This aims to build trust and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I'm again leaving the door open for further negotiation, indicating I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable solution.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good profit while maintaining a strong relationship.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer, always considering my minimum desired price and John's offer."
