"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer is meant to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I receive a price that's at least close to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell the product to John for $15,000, Bob's offer of $12,000 is just barely above my minimum acceptable price.  We are in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to start over with a new buyer.  I will accept Bob's offer."
