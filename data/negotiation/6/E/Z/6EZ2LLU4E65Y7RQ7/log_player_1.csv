Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Value Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $100 to you, you're subtly anchoring its value in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room:** While you want to maximize profit, setting the price too high might scare Bob away. Offering it at $120 leaves some space for him to counter-offer or for you to slightly reduce the price if needed.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you always have the safety net of selling to John for $100."
