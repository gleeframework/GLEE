{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it.  However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer him and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
