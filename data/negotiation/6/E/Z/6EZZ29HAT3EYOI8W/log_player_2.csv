"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can still potentially get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it.  However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is still a good deal for Bob since he's willing to pay up to $10,000.  Accepting this offer means saving $800 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial option."
