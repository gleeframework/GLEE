Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential earnings before resorting to selling to John at your minimum price."
