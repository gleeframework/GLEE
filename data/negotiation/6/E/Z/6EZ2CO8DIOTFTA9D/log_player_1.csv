Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value.
* **High but Negotiable:**  Starting at $145 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  It signals the product's worth to you.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a strong fallback option with John."
