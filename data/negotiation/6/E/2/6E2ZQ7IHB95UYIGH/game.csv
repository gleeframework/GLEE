"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $107? That's a fair compromise.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $111? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's my final offer.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your offer of $109,  I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet at $110?  That's just a dollar more, and I think it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,7,
