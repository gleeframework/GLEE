"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500, which would be $10250. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10250.0,Alice,5,
