# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're proposing a special introductory price of $140 for you. This is an exclusive offer tailored to appreciate your interest and loyalty. We're confident it will meet your expectations and provide substantial value. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $140 is below your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better price. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $120 valuation. You always have the safety net of buying from John for $150."
