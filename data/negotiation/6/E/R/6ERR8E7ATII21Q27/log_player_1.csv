Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because $70 is below my minimum price of $80. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $80 to make this worthwhile. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $90. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85. How about $77.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still below $80. I'm going to see if I can get a slightly higher price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $77.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $79.50? It's a small adjustment, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer of $79.5 is close to my minimum price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him. I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with nothing.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so that's the best option for me at this point."
