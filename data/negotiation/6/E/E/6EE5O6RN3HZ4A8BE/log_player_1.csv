Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest while remaining polite and professional. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000. 

**Important Note:** While you aim to maximize profit, be mindful of not appearing too aggressive with your initial offer, as it might discourage Bob from further negotiation."
