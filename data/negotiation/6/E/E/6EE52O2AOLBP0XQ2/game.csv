"I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13500 to reflect your enthusiasm.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,
