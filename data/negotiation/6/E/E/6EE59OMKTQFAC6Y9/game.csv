,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in the product and think that would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to go down to $85 at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $88? That's a good compromise and we can both walk away happy with the deal.  What do you think?",88.0,Bob,4,
