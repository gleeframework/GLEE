Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very beneficial for you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Respecting Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, my opening offer doesn't reflect that knowledge.  Starting higher allows me to potentially understand his willingness to pay and negotiate from there.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  I won't mention John directly, but knowing I have another buyer gives me a strong position in the negotiation."
