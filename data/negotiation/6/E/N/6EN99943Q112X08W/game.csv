"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to you and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This reflects a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000, so I'm thinking $875,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is closer to my target, I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $860,000. This reflects a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",860000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're committed to finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $860,000, so I'm thinking $867,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",867500.0,Alice,7,
