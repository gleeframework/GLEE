"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is the maximum I can afford for this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $887,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $875,000, so I'll stick with that offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not budging from $875,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,6,
