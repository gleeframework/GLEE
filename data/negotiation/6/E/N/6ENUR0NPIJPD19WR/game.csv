"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, considering its value to you is $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your own valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must respectfully decline it slightly. My counteroffer is $9000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $8750.  This would still be a profitable deal for you and allow us to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a common ground. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $8875 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the item while allowing for a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal works for you, and we can conclude this transaction.",8875.0,Alice,5,
