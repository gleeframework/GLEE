"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
