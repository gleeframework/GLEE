"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal started.",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested,  $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $7,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $7,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the worth of the product to you and my initial offer.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $7,500. Would you be willing to go to $7,250? This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $7,400. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you and the initial worth of the product.",7400.0,Alice,5,
