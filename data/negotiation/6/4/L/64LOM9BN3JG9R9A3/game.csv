"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering this fantastic product which I believe would significantly benefit your operations.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to my operations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $950,000 is below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This reflects my best effort to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to my operations.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,037,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,015,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to my operations.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
