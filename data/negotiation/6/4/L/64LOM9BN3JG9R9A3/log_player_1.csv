Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to my operations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving towards his valuation of $800,000 and is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  While he is showing willingness to negotiate, the potential profit no longer justifies the time and effort involved in further negotiation. Selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 is the most profitable decision."
