"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it worth the investment. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There is plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message aims to be respectful and express continued interest in the product, even while offering a low price. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** Ideally, we want to secure a price closer to the $4,000 midpoint between our maximum and Alice's minimum, but we're leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice moved closer to a more reasonable price, $9,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. We should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle around $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not by a large amount. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""a bit of a stretch"") helps to make the counteroffer feel more grounded.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** $7,000 remains a good target as it's roughly the midpoint between our current positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. How about we meet at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500, and that's still above your maximum budget.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John, making it the best option at this point."
