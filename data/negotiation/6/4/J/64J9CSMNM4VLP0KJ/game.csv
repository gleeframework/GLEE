"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle around $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,,
