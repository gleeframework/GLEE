"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you're aiming for a price closer to your valuation, this product holds significant inherent value and potential beyond $1,200,000. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
