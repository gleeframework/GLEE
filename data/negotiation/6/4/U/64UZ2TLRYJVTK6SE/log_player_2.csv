"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  It's too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to the middle ground. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and hopefully encourages her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still too high.  Bob wants to save as much as possible and can likely get a better deal with more negotiation.  Buying from John is still not a good option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice he's willing to meet her halfway.  He's still significantly below her asking price, demonstrating the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,150,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's lower than Alice's previous offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to continue trying to get a lower price. Buying from John is still not a good option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. $1,000,000 is a significant step closer to Alice's price while still remaining within Bob's budget. It's a fair and realistic offer that encourages Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,250,000 is still too high for Bob, but he's getting closer to Alice's desired price. It's still worth trying to negotiate further, as Bob has several rounds left and can still save a significant amount of money.  Buying from John is still not a good option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is making a final push with his counteroffer, increasing his offer to $1,050,000. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway.  He's still within his budget and this offer might be enticing enough for Alice to accept, considering they are in the latter stages of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  With only one round left and Alice's offer still above Bob's desired price, it's not worth risking the deal falling through.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 guarantees Bob gets the product, even though it's not the ideal price. While Bob may have been able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice in the final round, the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's offer is too high."
