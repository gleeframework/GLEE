"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet closer to the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $120 is a good price for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go.,90.0,Bob,4,
