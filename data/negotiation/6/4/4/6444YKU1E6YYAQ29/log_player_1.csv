"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm not going too low yet, as I have the option to sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Staying firm:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair price, and it positions me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to continue our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to encourage him to reconsider.
* **Keeping the door open:**  By suggesting a compromise, I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
