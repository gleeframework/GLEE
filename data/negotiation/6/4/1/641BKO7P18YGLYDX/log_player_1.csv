Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,000,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Using phrases like ""immense value"" and ""exceed your expectations"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, aiming higher with Bob allows us to explore the possibility of exceeding our minimum desired outcome."
