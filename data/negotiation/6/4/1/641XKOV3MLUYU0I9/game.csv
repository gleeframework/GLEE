"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I still feel there's room for negotiation. How about we aim for a price closer to $1,300,000? I understand this is still above my initial budget, but I believe it would be a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,350,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're able to continue our discussion, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully, and while it's an improvement, I'd like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair compromise without exceeding my budget significantly.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
