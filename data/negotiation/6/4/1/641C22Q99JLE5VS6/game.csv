,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product has for you, while also being more in line with your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1000000. This price is fair and allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you the product for $1050000 again, but I'm willing to make a small concession to $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
