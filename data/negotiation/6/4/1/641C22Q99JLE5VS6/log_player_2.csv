You can do better than $1,100,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product has for you, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and try to push the price lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you the product for $1050000 again, but I'm willing to make a small concession to $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is offering the product for $1,025,000 which is within Bob's budget, and  still a better deal than buying it from John."
