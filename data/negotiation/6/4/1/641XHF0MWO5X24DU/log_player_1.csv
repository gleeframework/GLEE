"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives us room to negotiate and ensures I get a good price while still leaving potential for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there is room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better price. I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer of $800,000, as I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable counteroffer to Bob's $900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a high price."
