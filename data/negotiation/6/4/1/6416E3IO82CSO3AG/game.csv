"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $750,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm motivated to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I could potentially meet you at $800,000.  This is a strong offer from my side, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
