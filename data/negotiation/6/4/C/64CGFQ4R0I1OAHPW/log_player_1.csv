Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make this transaction smooth and worthwhile. How about a price of $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 presents an opportunity for higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $925,000 leaves a substantial portion of the potential profit ($75,000) on the table for Bob, making it a very attractive deal. 
* **First Refusal:**  Offering Bob the first right of refusal at this price point allows me to potentially secure the best possible deal before resorting to my backup option (John)."
