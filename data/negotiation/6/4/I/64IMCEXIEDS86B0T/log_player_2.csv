"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. It's worth seeing if I can drive the price down even more before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now only $20,000 apart. At this point, it's worth accepting her offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings."
