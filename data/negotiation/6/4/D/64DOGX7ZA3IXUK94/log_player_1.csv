"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a quick deal, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $120 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to go that low right now. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great price for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $125 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not acceptable. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for less than $130 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $135 this time. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've done some research and found that similar products are available for around $120. I'm willing to pay up to $130 for your product, considering its unique features. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is now at my minimum price. I'm not sure if I can get more in the remaining rounds, and there's always a risk of him backing out or making a lower counteroffer.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid any more risk."
