Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a profit for me. I've set the price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), but lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($12,000). This approach should encourage Bob to negotiate, but hopefully not too aggressively."
