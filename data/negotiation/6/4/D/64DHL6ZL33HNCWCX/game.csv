"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $16,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $16,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  How about $13,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $14,500, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
