Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for some negotiation room. I'm confident that this product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see its value as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I'm not happy to be selling for my minimum,  it's better than accepting an offer that's lower than my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
