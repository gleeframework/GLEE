"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
