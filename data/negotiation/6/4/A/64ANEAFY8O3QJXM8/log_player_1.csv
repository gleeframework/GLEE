"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my potential earnings. $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still above my minimum price. 
* **Showing value:**  I emphasize the value to Bob to make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to negotiation:** I use ""fair price"" to indicate flexibility and invite Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  $90 is closer to my minimum of $80, but I still believe I can get a better price. 
* **Negotiation space:** I want to continue the negotiation to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, I'm willing to risk another round to potentially get $100 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value reinforcement:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to keep him motivated. 
* **Moderate increase:** $95 is a reasonable increase from Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Finality:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still leaving space for Bob to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $92 is only $8 away from my initial target of $100. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for further negotiations:** Even if I accept this offer, I can still try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price in future transactions. 

Selling to John would guarantee $80, but I'm confident I can get more from Bob, even if it means accepting a slightly lower price than initially hoped for."
