"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1,900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $1,550,000.  This is a significant step towards your price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
