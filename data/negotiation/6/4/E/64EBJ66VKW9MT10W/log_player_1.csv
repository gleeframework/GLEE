Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $400,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a lot of room to counteroffer without going below your minimum, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Starting too high could make Bob immediately walk away. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your profit margin and the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a better price. You have room to negotiate upwards, and rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that could secure a higher price. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a loss compared to what you could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This price is closer to your desired amount and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:**  The offer is $100,000 higher than Bob's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, while still remaining profitable for you.
* **Highlight common ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, making the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Stay above your minimum:** You're still above your $800,000 minimum, ensuring you won't settle for a deal that's unprofitable."
