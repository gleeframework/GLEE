"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10,500, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10875.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $10,875, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $11,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11100.0,Alice,5,
