"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the high price by emphasizing the product's ""unique value and potential.""
* **Open to Negotiation:** I signal willingness to negotiate by stating, ""I am open to discussing this further."" This encourages Bob to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  I keep in mind my alternative option (selling to John for $1,500,000) as a safety net throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'll aim to bring the price closer to $2,000,000 before considering accepting. I'm willing to leverage the remaining rounds and risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, I believe this product's long-term value and potential for your specific needs warrant a higher price. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value and tailoring it to Bob's ""specific needs"" to justify the higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $1,800,000, I'll need to decide how much I'm willing to concede in future rounds. 
* **John in the Background:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a potential fallback, especially if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,500,000, securing a substantial profit.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to ""meet halfway"" suggests he's serious about the purchase and might not be easily swayed to go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further has opportunity costs. Accepting now allows me to close the deal and move on to other potential ventures. 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer ($1,500,000) is too significant at this point."
