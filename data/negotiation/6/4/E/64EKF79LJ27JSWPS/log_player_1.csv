Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is less than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  It also uses positive language to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80 and represents a good profit. It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose him as a buyer."
