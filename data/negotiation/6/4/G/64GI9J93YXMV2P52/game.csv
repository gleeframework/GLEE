"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,500 right now. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
