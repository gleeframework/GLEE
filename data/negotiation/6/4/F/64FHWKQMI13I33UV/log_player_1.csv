Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it at $14,000 allows you to maximize your profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($1,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, further increasing your profit. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  The offer is significantly higher than your backup option (John at $12,000). This minimizes the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and ensures a good profit."
