Bob's offer:

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $100 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Matches John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer means I sell the product at the same price John is offering. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing. Accepting now guarantees the sale. 
* **Minimal Gain vs. Risk:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is small compared to the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
