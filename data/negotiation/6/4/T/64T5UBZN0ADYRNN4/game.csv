"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget. While the product's value is truly in the $1,400,000 range, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my budget constraints, could we discuss a price closer to $1,325,000? This would allow me to make a more informed decision.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm still confident in the $1,375,000 valuation, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,350,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my hope to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
