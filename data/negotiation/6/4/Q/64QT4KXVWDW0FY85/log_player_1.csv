"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $13,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to leverage my own valuation of $12,000 and the possibility of selling to John as bargaining chips."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $12,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum valuation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This time I'm going all-in with my minimum valuation of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm serious about this price and that I'm not willing to go lower."
