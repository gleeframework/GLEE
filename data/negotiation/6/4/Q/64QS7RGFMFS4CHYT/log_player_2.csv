"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price. However, as a gesture of goodwill and to begin our potential business partnership, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than her initial value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. You have a better alternative available."
