"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm comfortable starting with a higher price and seeing if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's a decent starting point for negotiations. I'm not willing to settle for $1,300,000 yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000.  This is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  This price also gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to sell at this price yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000.  This is still a bit higher than my minimum, but it's a good compromise. I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not going to give up my margin completely.  This price gives me a good chance of closing the deal while still meeting my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob making a counteroffer that's too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price with another buyer later on, as my product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me."
