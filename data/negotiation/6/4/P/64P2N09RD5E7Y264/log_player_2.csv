``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's own valuation of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still above her own valuation. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially secure a better deal."

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her initial offer of $1,200,000. While this is still above her own valuation, it's the best deal I've been able to negotiate so far.  I can accept this offer, as it's still within my budget and significantly less than what I would pay John."
