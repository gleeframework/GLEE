"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is quite high, and $9,000 is below its true worth. I could meet you halfway at $10,000. This offer reflects the product's value while still providing you with a good deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
