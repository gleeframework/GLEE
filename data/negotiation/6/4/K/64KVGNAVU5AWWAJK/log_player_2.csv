You can do better than $100. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with the $75 offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price!

You are still better off trying to get a lower price.  The product is worth $80 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $92. I think this is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

```

Alice has come down to $92, which is still a good deal for you. It's worth accepting the offer and saving some money, rather than risking getting a higher price from John."
