Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it really useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my $120 goal, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and ending up with nothing.  $92 is still a decent price, and accepting it guarantees a sale."
