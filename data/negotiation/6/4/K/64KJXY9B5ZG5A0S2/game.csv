"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and our potential for a long-term business relationship. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",850000.0,Bob,4,
