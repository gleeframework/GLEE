"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. There's a significant gap between Alice's desired price ($800,000) and your maximum ($1,200,000). This gives you room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?
