"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for $1,400,000? This would still allow me to get a good deal on the product, while respecting its value to you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet you at $1,600,000. I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $1,550,000 be acceptable to you?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
