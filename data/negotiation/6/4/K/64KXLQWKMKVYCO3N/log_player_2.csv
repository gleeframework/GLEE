Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your budgetary constraints, and I want to see us reach an agreement. Let's split the difference â€“ $875,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.

```

At $875,000, Alice's offer is within your budget and represents a significant discount from her original price. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate as the rounds progress. Accepting this offer secures you the product at a reasonable price."
