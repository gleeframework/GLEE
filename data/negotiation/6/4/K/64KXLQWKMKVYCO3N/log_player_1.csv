"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, however, I believe the price point is a bit high for my budget.  I would be willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the  $650,000 offer is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, the current offer is still a bit outside my budget. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers at $812,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, indicating he's motivated. We're still significantly above his initial offer and have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, coming closer to the middle ground makes sense.  How about $900,000? This shows I'm serious about making this deal work, but also reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer, but in smaller increments than his increases. This keeps a sense of negotiation while showing we're willing to deal.
* **Strong Value Statement:** Re-emphasizing the product's worth prevents us from getting too low too quickly. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he sees this value, even if he can't meet the full price. 
* **""Round"" Number:** Using a number like $900,000 feels more significant than $895,000, potentially making Bob feel like it's a more substantial move on our part."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. $900,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle at $850,000? I believe that is a fair offer considering the value and keeps this deal within what I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Maintaining Momentum:** Bob is still engaging and increasing his offer, showing he's invested in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  While $850,000 is tempting, we're getting close to the halfway point between his initial offer and ours. There's still potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have several rounds left. While John's offer is always there, we lose potential profit by accepting it too early."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budgetary constraints, and I want to see us reach an agreement. Let's split the difference â€“ $875,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This directly addresses Bob's concern about fairness while keeping the price above his last offer.
* **Firm but Fair Tone:** ""Splitting the difference"" creates a sense of finality, implying we're nearing the end of our concessions.
* **Time Pressure:**  By round 7, Bob might be more amenable to a compromise to avoid missing out on the deal entirely."
