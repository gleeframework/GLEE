"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $900000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $750000. I'm proposing a new offer of $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I need to make some adjustments. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
