"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
