"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for this product.  Considering its potential value for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, while also giving you a significant price advantage.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still a bit off on that price. Considering the product's unique features and how it can benefit your business, I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This price reflects a fair compromise while still ensuring I can cover my costs. Let's make this deal happen!",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
