Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who is willing to pay $150.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $120.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
