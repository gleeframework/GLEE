"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal.  This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to consider the offer and potentially come back with a counteroffer of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to his desired range. It's likely that Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since she rejected Bob's previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,500.  It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a fair price. By offering $9,500, Bob is demonstrating that he is willing to negotiate, while still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to consider a price closer to Bob's maximum budget without making a large concession."
