"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle for $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's asking price ($11,000) to give ourselves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ultimate goal is to get the price as close to our $10,000 walk-away point as possible while still securing the deal. This offer gives us a good starting point to work towards that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our acceptable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming to get as close as possible to $10,000, and accepting $9,500 would leave money on the table. We'll make another counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to land a little lower.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are increasing our offer to $9,000, showing Alice that we are willing to negotiate but also signaling that we are serious about getting a good price.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in reaching a deal.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us in a strong position. It's a significant increase from our previous offer, signaling flexibility, but it's still below our walk-away price, ensuring we don't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is making concessions. However, $9,250 is still above our ideal price, and we haven't reached our walk-away point yet. There's a possibility of negotiating a slightly better deal, so we'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm ready to close this deal if we can agree on $9,100.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 9100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($9,250) and our previous counteroffer ($9,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a better price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating we're ready to close the deal, we inject a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps us below our walk-away price of $10,000 but puts us in a strong position to either finalize the deal or make a final push in the next round if needed."
