Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob, while giving you a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I can likely do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, but it also brings me closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still a good profit and significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  There's a chance that further negotiation could get me even more, but it's also possible that Bob will walk away.  I'm taking the guaranteed profit at this point."
