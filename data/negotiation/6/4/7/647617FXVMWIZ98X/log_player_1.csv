``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm countering with $950,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's a significant amount more than my minimum and a good outcome for me."
