"Alice, I understand the value, but I have a firm budget. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers and go down to $812,500.  This reflects the value of the product and should allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!",812500.0,Alice,5,
