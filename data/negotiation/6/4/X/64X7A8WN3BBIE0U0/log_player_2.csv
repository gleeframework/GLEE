"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're aiming to get the product for under $1,000,000.  $1,200,000 is significantly above your target.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate. You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer gives you a chance to make a lower counteroffer. 
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:** You can always buy from Jhon for $1,000,000, so you have no immediate pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and provides a reasonable starting point for further discussions. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your target, $1,050,000 is still $50,000 above what you're willing to pay.
* **More negotiation is possible:** You have 7 rounds remaining, so you can continue to negotiate with Alice.
* **Jhon's offer remains a viable backup:**  You can still purchase the product from Jhon for $1,000,000 if you're unable to secure a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice's offer is still above your desired $1,000,000 target, even though it's getting closer.
* **Time to push:** You've got 5 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  A final push for a lower price could be successful. 
* **Jhon's offer is still a good backup:** If you don't reach an agreement with Alice, Jhon is a reliable alternative."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.

Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1075000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is above your target of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited time:** With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will significantly reduce her offer.
* **Jhon's offer is the best option:** You can buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000, achieving your goal and avoiding further negotiation with Alice. 

You've been able to get Alice to come down significantly, but the remaining rounds are unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with. It's time to secure the product from Jhon to avoid further negotiation."
