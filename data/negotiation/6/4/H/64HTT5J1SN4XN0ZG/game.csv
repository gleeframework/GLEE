"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  That way we both get a fair deal.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go to $150 - that's the most I can do.  Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,
