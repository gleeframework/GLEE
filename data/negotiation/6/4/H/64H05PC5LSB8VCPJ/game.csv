"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $9000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",9500.0,Alice,3,
