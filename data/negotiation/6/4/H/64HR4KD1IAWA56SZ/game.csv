"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this price reflects the value I'll get from the product, and it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a sweet spot in between.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $850000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
