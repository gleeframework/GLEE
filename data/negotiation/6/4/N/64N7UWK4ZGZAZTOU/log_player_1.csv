"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I'm aiming for the highest possible price, and knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me gives me confidence to push for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for me to potentially get closer to my initial asking price. I'm trying to find a balance between being firm in my desired price and not risking losing the deal with Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, we're getting close to the middle ground and I don't want to risk losing the deal. With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure I don't end up selling to John for a lower price."
