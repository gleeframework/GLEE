"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $13,000?  Let's try to make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $13,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit lower price.  Would you consider $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
