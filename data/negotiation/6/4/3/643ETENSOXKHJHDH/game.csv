"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for sticking with me. I value your interest in the product and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $15,500? This is my final offer, as it barely covers the value this product holds.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I can do $12,000.  I understand this is your final offer, but let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",12000.0,Bob,6,
