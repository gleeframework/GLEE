"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the value and unique nature of the product, aiming to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I signal willingness to negotiate, but I still hold firm on the product's inherent value.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high and showing openness to negotiation, I aim to secure a favorable price while keeping the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage. I'll counteroffer to bridge the gap and see if we can find common ground.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your interest.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting concession:** I emphasize that this is a significant concession to show good faith and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a fair price for both of us, aiming to find a compromise that satisfies both parties.

**Strategy:**

By making a significant counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining my negotiating position. I hope to reach an agreement in the next round, but I'm prepared to continue the negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from where I'm at. To be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it still falls short of what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't adequately reflect the value. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a combination of strategies here:

* **Holding firm:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's pressure to accept a price that's below my target.
* **Showing flexibility:** I've lowered my price significantly from my initial offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a deal and have other options (selling to John).

I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, but if I don't see progress in the next few rounds, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle (again):** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Framing it as a fair price:** I'm emphasizing that $850,000 is a fair price for both of us, giving Bob a good deal while still ensuring I receive a reasonable return for the product.
* **Remaining open to negotiation:** I end the message by asking Bob for his thoughts, signaling that I'm still open to further discussion.

**Strategy:**

By making a reasonable counteroffer and focusing on fairness, I hope to incentivize Bob to accept the deal. I'm still not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I'm trying to reach a compromise before the negotiations stall. I'm also considering selling to John if we can't come to an agreement in the next few rounds."
