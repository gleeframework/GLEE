Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your interest.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Explanation: While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd accept, I can buy the product from John right now for $800,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when I have a guaranteed deal at my target price."
