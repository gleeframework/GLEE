"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your interest.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from where I'm at. To be fair to both of us, I'd be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
