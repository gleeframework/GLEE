"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer, but $160 is still a little too steep for me. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the price I'm willing to sell for. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $145. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Alice,5,
