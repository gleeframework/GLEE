"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very fair price. How does $100 sound?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling for $100, while John is selling for $120.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than to Alice:** Bob values the product at $120, while Alice values it at $80.  This means there's room for a mutually beneficial transaction.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $20 compared to buying from John."
