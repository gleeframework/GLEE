As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $900,000, I can meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
