"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great price for a product that you value at $100. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $97.50? That's a fair compromise.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $101.25 is the lowest I can go.  Let's make this deal happen!",101.25,Alice,5,
