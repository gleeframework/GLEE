You've gotten the price down to $130, which is within your budget.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's risky to keep rejecting offers. There's a chance that Alice will get frustrated and stop negotiating, forcing you to buy from John for $150. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price."
