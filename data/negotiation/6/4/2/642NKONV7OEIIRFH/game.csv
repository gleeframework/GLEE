"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $900,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $950,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. This is the absolute highest I can go, let's make this happen!",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $975,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, let's keep going!",975000.0,Alice,7,
