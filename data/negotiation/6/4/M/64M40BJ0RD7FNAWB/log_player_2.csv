"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, the product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, so there's room to find a middle ground.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a slightly better price.  Would you be willing to do $11,000? This is a fair price that respects both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still higher than your counteroffer.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, accepting this offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John."
