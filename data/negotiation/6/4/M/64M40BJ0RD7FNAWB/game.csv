"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, the product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a slightly better price.  Would you be willing to do $11,000? This is a fair price that respects both of our positions.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
