"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for this product. Could you do $90? I'm willing to be a little flexible to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $90 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above our $80 limit. We should counteroffer again and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair offer for both of us, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about this.  How about $85 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our limit, but we're only $5 away from John's price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're really close! I could do $80, and I think that's a very fair deal considering the market value. What do you say?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```"
