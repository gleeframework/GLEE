Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by asking for a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but not excessively so. It also expresses confidence in reaching a fair deal, aiming to keep the negotiation positive.  This strategy aims to start a conversation with Bob and explore if there's room for compromise without immediately pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it for less than $10,000 right now. I'll counter-offer him and see if we can reach a deal that is more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on this. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to continue negotiating with him.  Since I can get my minimum price from John, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiations."
