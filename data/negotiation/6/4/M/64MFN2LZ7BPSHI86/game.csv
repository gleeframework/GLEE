"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget.  Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while also staying within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1000000. This price still reflects the product's unique features and benefits, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1000000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that $900000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to come to a mutually agreeable agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $900000 is your target price, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the product's value. After re-evaluating the market again, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $950000. This price is closer to your target, but still reflects the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
