"Bob, I have a product that I believe is of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects the unique value and potential this product holds. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my current financial situation and the potential cost-benefit analysis, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I'm willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest in the product. While $950,000 is a significant offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. Would you consider $1,050,000?  This price reflects the unique value and potential this product holds, while also acknowledging your financial position. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still feel it's slightly above the value I can assign to the product given my current circumstances. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also being more in line with my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
