Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, considering my current financial situation and the potential cost-benefit analysis, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I'm willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still feel it's slightly above the value I can assign to the product given my current circumstances. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also being more in line with my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.
