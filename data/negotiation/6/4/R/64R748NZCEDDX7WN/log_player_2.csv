(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, there's always a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better deal without risking much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a lower price. A $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer shows Bob's intent to negotiate while still being within the acceptable price range.  This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a compromise from her initial offer, and it's within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation, potentially leading to a stalemate or a higher price."
