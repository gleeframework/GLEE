Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. Here's why:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $950,000 is $150,000 more than what you'd get from John.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than what it's worth to him. This incentivizes him to accept. 

By offering a price in the middle, you create a win-win situation where you get a better price than your fallback option, and Bob still gets a good deal."
