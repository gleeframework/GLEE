"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,625.  This seems like a fair price that would benefit both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,
