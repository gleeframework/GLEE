"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob places on the product.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired range.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, increasing it to $1,150,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still value the product significantly. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can secure a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,100,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,125,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be the price that closes the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer in the next round, but I'm also considering the option of selling to John if this round doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,075,000. This is a compromise, and it's very close to Bob's last offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll likely sell to John to avoid risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but with only a few rounds left, I'm worried I might not be able to get a better offer from Bob. I also want to avoid losing the deal altogether. 

It's time to be realistic.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a significant profit and it guarantees a sale."
