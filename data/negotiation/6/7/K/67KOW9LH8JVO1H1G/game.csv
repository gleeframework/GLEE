"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I could do $1,050,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its current market value.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000,  which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 as a final offer. If we can't find an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
