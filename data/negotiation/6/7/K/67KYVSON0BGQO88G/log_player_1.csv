{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($100), but it's lower than what I can get from John ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still better than nothing.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This price still allows me to make a profit while remaining within a fair range. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the need for a profit, but I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this is closer to what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not clear if we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John, so I'll sell to him."
