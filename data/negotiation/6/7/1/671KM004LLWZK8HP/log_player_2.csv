"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Given my budget, I'm comfortable offering $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in saving money.
* **Fairness:** It's still above Alice's value, allowing for some profit for her while getting Bob a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and professional tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and $1,100,000 is a fair compromise. 
* **Saving Money:**  While not the absolute lowest price, it still saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:** Accepting the offer avoids potentially going back and forth for several more rounds, which could risk a breakdown in the negotiation."
