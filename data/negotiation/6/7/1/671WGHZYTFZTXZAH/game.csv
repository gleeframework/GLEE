"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $8,500? That's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my set limit. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,400, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8400.0,Alice,5,
