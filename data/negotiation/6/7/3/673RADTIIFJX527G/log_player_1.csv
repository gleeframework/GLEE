Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't sell it for less than $100. How about we settle on $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than your minimum ($100).
* **Fairness:** Offering a price in the middle ($110) can be perceived as fair and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Backup Option:**  You have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you don't go below your minimum."
