Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000."", ""product_price"": 2250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high initial price, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it outright, his counteroffer might still be higher than what he might have initially considered.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage. I can afford to be patient and walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which still represents a good value for you given your stated worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price. While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, accepting $1,200,000 would be a substantial loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your position, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 doesn't reflect that. To move things forward, I'm willing to consider $1,850,000. I believe this price point represents a fairer deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've significantly reduced my price from $2,250,000 to $1,850,000, signaling flexibility. However, it's still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value to justify the price, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Encouraging Movement:**  By making a substantial move, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to increase his offer significantly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,850,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my $1,500,000 minimum. His incremental increases suggest he might not be willing to go much higher.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure my minimum acceptable price right now. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort.  Selling to John provides a clean and immediate resolution."
