Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a great price for Alice.
* **Time Value:**  Offering it to Bob first at a slight ""discount"" might encourage a quicker sale than waiting for John's guaranteed $8,000."
