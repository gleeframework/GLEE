Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I want to see if I can get a higher price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $920,000 is a good price. It's getting close to my desired price and is significantly higher than what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
