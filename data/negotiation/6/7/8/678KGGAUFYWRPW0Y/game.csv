"Alice, thanks for the offer! $13,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $10,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $10,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its true value is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
