"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential benefits, I'm offering it at a price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! $13,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $10,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While $10,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its true value is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  $11,500 is closer to Bob's goal, but it's worth pushing for a bit more.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has multiple rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
