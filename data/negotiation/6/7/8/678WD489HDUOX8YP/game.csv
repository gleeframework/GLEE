"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 was a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $98, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95, but this is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92 again? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise further.",92.0,Bob,8,
