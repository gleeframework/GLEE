Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This should show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product significantly higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I believe I can still get a higher price than $11,000, especially since I have a backup buyer in John."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again, offering $12,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  If this offer is rejected, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
