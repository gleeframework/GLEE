{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation while still ensuring I potentially make a profit.  I'm willing to go lower if Bob rejects but will ultimately sell to John if negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, well below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and make some profit, I'm confident I can get a higher price by counter-offering.  I'm not going to sell to John just yet because there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, if you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm making a significant concession by dropping the price to $1,300,000.  This is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me with some profit.  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already made significant concessions and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. He's shown he's not willing to budge much, and I'm confident I can secure my desired price of $1,500,000 with John.  It's time to move on and avoid any further delays."
