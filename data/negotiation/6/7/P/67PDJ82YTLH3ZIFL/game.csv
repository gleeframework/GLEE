"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, if you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
