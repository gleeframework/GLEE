Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me. I want to try and get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below what I need to sell. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
