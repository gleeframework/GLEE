"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I can meet you in the middle at $1380000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $1360000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1390000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",1390000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I can offer you a price of $1385000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal happen.",1385000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to come to an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one last effort to close the deal. I can offer you a price of $1395000, but I need you to understand that this is my absolute final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and explore other opportunities.",1395000.0,Alice,9,
