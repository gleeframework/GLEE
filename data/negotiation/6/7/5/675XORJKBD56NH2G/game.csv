"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a high value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
