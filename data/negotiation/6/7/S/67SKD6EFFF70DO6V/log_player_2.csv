This item holds significant value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am prepared to consider offers. Given its immense value to you, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this figure strikes a fair balance between respecting its true worth and ensuring a reasonable return for me. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, and we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate further with Alice or explore other options."
