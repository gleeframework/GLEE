"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $120 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as it's still a good deal for me. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  This gives you a great price and me a fair return on my investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
