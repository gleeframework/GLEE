"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for us both. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still over his budget. He should try to negotiate a price closer to his maximum of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,000?  That would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $12,000? That's a significant price drop on my end, and I'm hoping we can close the deal with this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, $12,000 is still a stretch for him. He should try to negotiate a lower price, or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to come down that much, I'm going to have to consider buying from John."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  I need to make sure this is a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. While he could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his desired price and saves time and effort."
