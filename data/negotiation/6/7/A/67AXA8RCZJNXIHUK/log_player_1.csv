Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and my other options, I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your minimum ($10,000). 
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies you're not desperate and have other potential buyers.

This strategy attempts to secure the best possible price from Bob without completely alienating him with an unrealistically high offer."
