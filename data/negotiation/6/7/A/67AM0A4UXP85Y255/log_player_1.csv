{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a good start for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of a fair deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to engage in a back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price and can move forward with the sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away to deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have the advantage of having a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage to counter Bob's offer.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. While it's unlikely he'll reach my ideal price, I might be able to secure a deal closer to $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming for a mutually acceptable solution."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,000,000, he's still getting a good deal based on his perceived value.
* **Confidence in reaching an agreement:**  I'm expressing optimism about a successful outcome, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price, and we can proceed with the sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to decide whether to counter again, lower my price slightly, or move on to John. My decision will be based on Bob's potential for further negotiation, the time invested in the process, and my overall urgency to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Still have leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer, and I'm not under any pressure to sell to Bob immediately.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I might be able to push Bob a little higher with another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll need to carefully assess my chances of success and the potential for a stalemate with Bob. If it seems unlikely to reach an agreement with Bob, I might start considering John as my primary buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise from my previous offer of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway again, without significantly sacrificing my position.
* **Framing as a Win:** I'm emphasizing the ""great opportunity"" for Bob to acquire the product at a price closer to his perceived value, encouraging him to see the value in accepting this final offer.
* **Clear Intent:** I'm stating my desire to ""make this deal happen,"" indicating that I'm serious about finding a mutually beneficial solution and avoiding further back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a price that is still above my minimum and can close the deal with Bob.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will re-evaluate my position and decide whether to:
    * **Counteroffer Again:** With another, very small compromise, but only if I believe there's still a high chance of securing a deal.
    * **Move to John:** If further negotiation with Bob seems unproductive or time-consuming, I will finalize the sale with John."
