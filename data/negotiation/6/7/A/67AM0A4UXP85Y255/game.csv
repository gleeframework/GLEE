"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
