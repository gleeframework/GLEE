"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  Let's see if we can make this happen.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far from $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the closest I can go to your original offer of $95.,87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still below my minimum. How about we compromise at $92.50? That's a fair price considering I initially offered it at $95.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",88.0,Bob,6,
