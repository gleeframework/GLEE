"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This should incentivize Bob to consider the offer without immediately rejecting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I want to see if I can get closer to my target value through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the closest I can go to your original offer of $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still below my minimum. How about we compromise at $92.50? That's a fair price considering I initially offered it at $95."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
``` 

I'm continuing to try and find a middle ground with Bob, this time proposing $92.50, which is halfway between my last offer and his current offer. I'm hoping to reach a deal before we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's getting increasingly unlikely I'll reach my desired price point.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best course of action at this point."
