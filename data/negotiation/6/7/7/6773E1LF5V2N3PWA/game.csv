,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to land this product for $10,750. This feels like a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,900. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",10900.0,Alice,5,
