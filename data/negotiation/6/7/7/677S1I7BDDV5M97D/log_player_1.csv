Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its worth to you.  Let's find a middle ground to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $975,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that.  Let's split the difference this time. How about $1,012,500?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we seem to be getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $990,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the negotiations are taking longer than anticipated, and I'm worried I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price before the 10 rounds are up.  John's offer is still a good deal, and it guarantees me a sale at a decent price."
