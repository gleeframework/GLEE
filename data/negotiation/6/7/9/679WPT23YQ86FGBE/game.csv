"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I know its value is even higher for someone like you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit, while still giving you a substantial savings compared to its true worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
