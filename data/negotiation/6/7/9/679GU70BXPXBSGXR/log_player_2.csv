"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $1,000,000. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $950,000, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you'll end up paying more. It's wiser to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
