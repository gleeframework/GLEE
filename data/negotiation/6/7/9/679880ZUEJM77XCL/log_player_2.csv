Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

$1,500,000 is still too high for my budget. I will make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,400,000 is still too expensive.  It's worth making another counteroffer and trying to get closer to my goal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is my final offer.  This is a reasonable price, considering I'm very close to my maximum budget.  Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
