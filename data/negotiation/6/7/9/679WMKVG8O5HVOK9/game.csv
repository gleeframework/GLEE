"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'll take $110 for it. That's still a fair price for a product worth $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $110 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
