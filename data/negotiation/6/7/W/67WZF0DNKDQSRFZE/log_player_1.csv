Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still ensuring I make a significant profit. It's important to start high to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and to gauge his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This should keep Bob engaged while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,850,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than selling to John.  It's a good compromise that ensures I get a profitable sale."
