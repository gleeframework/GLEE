"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer in its field, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount of money.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a lower price.  I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to my initial counteroffer, but I'm open to some negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $795000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and I'm now within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  At $795,000, I'm getting a good deal and saving a significant amount of money compared to John."
