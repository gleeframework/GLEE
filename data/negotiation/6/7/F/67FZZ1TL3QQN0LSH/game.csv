"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is $1,500,000? I believe there might be room for compromise here.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
