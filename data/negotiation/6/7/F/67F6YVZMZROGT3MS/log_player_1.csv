Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

This starting point aims high but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to appear confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $80 is too low for me.  Would you consider $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows Flexibility:**  We're moving closer to Bob's range, signaling willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $120 is still a profitable price for me.
* **Justification:** By saying ""too low *for me*,"" I focus on my own constraints without directly challenging Bob's perception of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $120. I'm still thinking $80 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale."
