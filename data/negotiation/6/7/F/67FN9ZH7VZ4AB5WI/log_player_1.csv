Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** The message highlights the value of the product and positions the price as a good deal. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Prepared for Counteroffers:** I'm ready for Bob to counteroffer. If he does, I can adjust my price accordingly, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, providing security in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Potential:** Even though Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have a strong position because I have John as a backup buyer, willing to pay $80. This gives me room to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm confident that I can find a price that's acceptable to both of us. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at his current price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a slight compromise by lowering my price from $120 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $110 is still a good profit margin for me, and it's likely to be attractive to Bob, who was willing to pay $100.
* **Positive Tone:** My message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a positive and respectful tone. 
* **Strong Position:** I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $100, as I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** While $105 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly higher than my minimum of $80 and provides a reasonable profit margin.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've gone back and forth a few rounds, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a higher price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80.
* **Time Consideration:** Accepting the offer allows me to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds, potentially saving time.

**Conclusion:** Considering the potential profit, the risk of losing the deal, and the time factor, accepting Bob's offer for $105 is the most logical choice."
