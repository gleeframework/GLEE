Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and provides a significant return on investment for you. "", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and I know John will buy it for $1,500,000.  Therefore, I need to offer it to Bob for less than that to make it worthwhile for him.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I need to offer a price that's high enough to be profitable but low enough to entice him. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $1,350,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $350,000 if he leverages the product effectively. This significant potential upside makes it more likely he'll accept the offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While this is my initial offer, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
