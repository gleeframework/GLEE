"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000, which is a steal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
