"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still too high. Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would give you a significant profit, and it would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my limit."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $860,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget and provides you with a healthy profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 860000}

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $870,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $860,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 860000}
