"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would give you a significant profit, and it would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my limit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $860,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget and provides you with a healthy profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $870,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $870,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $860,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",860000.0,Bob,6,
