"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my initial price reflects the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price, considering my budget is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
