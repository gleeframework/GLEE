Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still a good starting point since the product is worth $800,000 to him.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $875,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping this is a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal. I'm concerned that if I reject his offer again, he might walk away, and then I would have to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
