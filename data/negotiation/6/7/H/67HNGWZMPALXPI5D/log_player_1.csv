Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to get Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial proposal.  I will be willing to lower the price gradually if necessary, but I will aim to keep the price above my minimum threshold of $150.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me a safety net and limits my risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum threshold of $150.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  While John is a good backup option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my original offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $140 represents a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still prepared to counter-offer again if necessary, but this offer puts me in a better position compared to accepting Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's offer is more attractive:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a safer and more lucrative option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential for a lower price. 

Selling to John ensures I reach my minimum threshold and eliminates the uncertainty associated with continued negotiation."
