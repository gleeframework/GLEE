It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, and you have 9 rounds to try and get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice sees the value in striking a deal quickly."

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I need to push harder to get a better deal, but I also need to be mindful of the risk of losing the deal completely."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to offer Alice $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to move closer to her price.  It's also a strategic move, as it's a good middle ground that makes the next few rounds more likely to end in a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I still have a few rounds left and there's potential for further negotiation.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm offering Alice $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for her, but it's also my maximum. If she rejects this, I'll have to go with John, which is a less favorable outcome for both of us."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and this is my last round. I'm getting close to my maximum price, and it's not worth risking missing out on the product altogether.  I'll buy it from John, even though it's a bit more expensive, to ensure I get the product."
