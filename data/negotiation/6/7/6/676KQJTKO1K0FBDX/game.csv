"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price takes into account your budget and still reflects the product's true worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This offer demonstrates my serious interest in the product, and it allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
