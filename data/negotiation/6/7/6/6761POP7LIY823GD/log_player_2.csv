"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, a price that I think is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,100,000 from Alice versus $1,500,000 from John. 
* **You save money.** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her valuation, it's still significantly lower than what you'd pay John."
