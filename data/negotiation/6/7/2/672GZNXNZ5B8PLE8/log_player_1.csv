Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $135, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy is based on the idea of meeting halfway and potentially earning more than selling to John. If Bob rejects, I can still fall back on the guaranteed $150 from John."
