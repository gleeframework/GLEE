# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

$950,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."

$900,000 is still too high.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm going to try to get Alice down a little more."

It seems Alice is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation. The potential savings are not significant enough to justify the risk of Alice walking away. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees I get the product, even if it's at a higher price."
