"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering it's well above your minimum of $800,000, and it leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's seal this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I think the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
