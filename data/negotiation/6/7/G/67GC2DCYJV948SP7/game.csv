"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-end item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm thinking of a price of $15000 for it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $12000, so I'm thinking of $10500. Can we meet at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to think about the value this product brings to the table. Let's aim for $11500. I'm confident you'll see the benefits and it's worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that reflects the value of the product, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I need you to meet me at that price. Can we make a deal at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
