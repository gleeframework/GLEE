"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, $18,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, and I'd like to see if we can meet at that price. Can you consider it?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  To be fair, I can't let it go for less than $13,500.  This is my final offer. ",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, and I'm hoping we can meet at that price. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd like to make a deal happen.",12000.0,Bob,6,
