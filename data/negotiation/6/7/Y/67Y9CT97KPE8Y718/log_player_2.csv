"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200.
