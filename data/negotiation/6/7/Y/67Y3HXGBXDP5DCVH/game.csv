"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I find the price a bit steep. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, I have another offer lined up, but I'd much rather work with you. I can go up to $1,000,000. That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,025,000.  This is a very fair offer considering your last counter. Hopefully, we can close this out now.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a little ridiculous.  I'll give you $1,050,000 and not a penny more. If you don't accept, I'm going with the other offer.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
