Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll appreciate. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $10,000. It allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit for me.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much about the product's value to me. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential buying power. If he rejects, I can adjust my price downwards or move on to John if the counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum value, I am not satisfied with this outcome. I believe the product has potential for a higher price, especially since it is unique.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $12,000?  This still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I've lowered my price to $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but a significant concession. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution. This helps maintain a good rapport with Bob during negotiation. 

This counteroffer balances the need to earn more than my minimum value with the desire to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I believe we can reach an even better agreement. Would $11000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $10,000 and closer to my desired price than John's offer. Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deadlock."
