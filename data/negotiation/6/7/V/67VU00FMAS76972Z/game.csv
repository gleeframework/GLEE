"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it has even greater potential for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still offering you a fair return for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
