"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1120000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000.",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1120000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I can offer it to you for $1180000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit anxious about the time it's taking to close this deal. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price by the next round, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000, Bob. I think we've reached a point where we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need you to meet me at least at the midpoint of our previous offers. I'm thinking of $1180000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1180000.0,Alice,9,
