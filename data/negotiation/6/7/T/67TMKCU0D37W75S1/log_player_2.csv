(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not willing to budge significantly. The offer is still above Bob's target price, and with only a few rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price, ensuring he stays within his budget.  It's a smart move to prioritize the goal of acquiring the product rather than continuing a protracted negotiation that may not yield a better outcome."
