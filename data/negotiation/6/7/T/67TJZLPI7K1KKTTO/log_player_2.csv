(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you'd pay from John.  There's a lot of room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer, aiming to significantly undercut Alice's initial price. This will likely trigger a response from her, and I can then adjust my offers based on her reactions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my counteroffer, but it's also much lower than John's price. I'm not quite ready to accept it yet. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $300,000, which is still a significant discount from Alice's offer but demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate.  This should signal to Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still lower than John's price, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $400,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's. This shows a willingness to meet halfway, but still leaves room for negotiation if she's not satisfied."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $75,000 more than my last counteroffer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's a significant saving over buying from John, and further negotiation might not yield a much better price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
