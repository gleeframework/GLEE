Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $85? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $85, and your goal is to get the best possible deal. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is better than Alice's current offer."
