Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By presenting $15,000 upfront, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making a price closer to $10,000 seem more reasonable later.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning you'll list it publicly (or subtly implying other buyers are interested) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you'll at least make your minimum. This allows you to be bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
