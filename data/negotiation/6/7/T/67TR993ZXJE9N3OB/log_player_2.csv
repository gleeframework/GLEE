"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial for you, and it's priced competitively considering its worth to you. Please let me know your decision by [date/time]. If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, it's unlikely she'd sell it for less than your maximum price ($1,000,000) to someone else. 
* **Your Advantage:** You know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is your fallback option.
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you're not losing the product. You're simply aiming for a better deal."
