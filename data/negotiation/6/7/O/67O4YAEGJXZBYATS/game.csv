"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $6,000, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my original ask. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  I think that's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original ask, but honestly, the gap between our positions is still pretty wide.  I can go up to $7,500, but I need to see some more flexibility on your end to make this deal happen. I also have to consider other options if we can't find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,
