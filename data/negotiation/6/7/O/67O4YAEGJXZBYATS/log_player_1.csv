Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $6,000, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we settle on $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I had in mind. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Would that work for you?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original ask, but honestly, the gap between our positions is still pretty wide.  I can go up to $7,500, but I need to see some more flexibility on your end to make this deal happen. I also have to consider other options if we can't find a price that works for both of us.
