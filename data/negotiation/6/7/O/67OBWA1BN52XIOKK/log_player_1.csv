Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Alice:** $1,200,000
* **Value to John:** $1,200,000
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** This is the key.  We want to maximize our profit by offering a price that Bob might find attractive, but still leaves us with a profit.

**Reasoning:**

Offering $1,500,000 is a strategic move:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  If Bob values the product at more than $1,500,000, he's likely to accept. This gives us a larger profit than selling to John.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Even if Bob rejects, we still have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000,  ensuring we meet our minimum value. 

**Important Note:** This is a basic strategy. In reality, a more complex negotiation would likely involve understanding Bob's potential needs and motivations, as well as potential counter-offers."
