"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference between your offer and mine, and settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure I can go as low as $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
