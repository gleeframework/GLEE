"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might differ based on your needs. To start, let me propose a price of $150. This includes not only the product itself but also a year of free maintenance and support. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the included maintenance and support,  $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your offer while still providing value, I would like to suggest an alternative. Instead of the full package at $150, how about we discuss a customized plan? For $120, you can receive the product with a one-year warranty and priority customer service. Would you be interested in exploring this option further?",120.0,Alice,3,
