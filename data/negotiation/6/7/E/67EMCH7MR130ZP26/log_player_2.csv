"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might differ based on your needs. To start, let me propose a price of $150. This includes not only the product itself but also a year of free maintenance and support. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point. There's room for negotiation to potentially save some money. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the included maintenance and support,  $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, aiming to quickly establish a lower negotiation range.  The message emphasizes your interest but also your budgetary limitations, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your offer while still providing value, I would like to suggest an alternative. Instead of the full package at $150, how about we discuss a customized plan? For $120, you can receive the product with a one-year warranty and priority customer service. Would you be interested in exploring this option further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to my desired price of $120 and is offering a revised package that includes a one-year warranty and priority customer service. While I initially wanted the full package, this is a good deal for my budget. Accepting this offer saves me $30 compared to buying from John and still gets me the product with some added benefits."
