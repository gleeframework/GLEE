{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $180 is better than $150, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $200."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $180 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $190? "", ""product_price"": 190}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $170 is still too low for me, and I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my goal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $185? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 185}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $175.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum of $150, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for less."
