Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $150, it's still within the range where negotiation is possible. I'm not willing to sell for his initial offer, but I'm open to finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and I pay $115?  It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John for $150 open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still above my budget. Would you consider $120 as a final price?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Round 7
