Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive and friendly tone for the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. You have 8 rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While $8,500 is closer to your minimum, you've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate and there are still 6 rounds left. There's a good chance you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference again. How about $9,000?  I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, you still have 4 rounds left and there's a chance you can get a better price. You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and by rejecting this offer, you can try to push him to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about $8,750?  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  You've already shown flexibility and negotiated, but it seems Bob is firm on his price.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
