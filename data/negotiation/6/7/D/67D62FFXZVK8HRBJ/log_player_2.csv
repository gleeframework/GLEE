"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible.  A counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than John's offer.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and still leaves room for a reasonable profit for Alice."
