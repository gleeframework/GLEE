"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my value for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I've placed on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm at my absolute limit at $950,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
