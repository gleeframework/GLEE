Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still giving us a good profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John. This gives us a strong fallback position."
