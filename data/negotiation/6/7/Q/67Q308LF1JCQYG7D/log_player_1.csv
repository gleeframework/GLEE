Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's work together to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or choose to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. How about we finalize this?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

* I'm watching Bob's responses closely to gauge his willingness to accept this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but I'm still limited by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a compromise that gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it's still a fair price. Let's see if we can finalize this now.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.
