"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a competitive offer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose a price of $8,800 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $8,800 is still higher than what John is selling it for.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should take the best deal available."
