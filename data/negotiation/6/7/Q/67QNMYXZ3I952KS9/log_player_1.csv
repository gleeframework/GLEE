Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""safety net.""
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $200,000.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to find a price that's appealing to Bob (so he accepts) but also maximizes your profit.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** The $1,150,000 price point allows Bob to realize a $50,000 gain on his perceived value, making it a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Strong Profit for You:** This price secures you an extra $150,000 compared to your backup offer from John.
* **Confidence and Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions your price as a fair deal, not just an arbitrary number. 

**Important Note:** There's always an element of risk. Bob could be a tough negotiator and decline, hoping you'll lower the price. However, this offer balances risk and reward effectively."
