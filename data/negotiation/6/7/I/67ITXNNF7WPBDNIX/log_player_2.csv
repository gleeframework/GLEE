Alice's starting offer is too high. I can definitely get a better price, even if it means going to John in the end."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?"",

}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $820,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

While Alice is coming down, I think I can still get a better price. I'm willing to play hardball for a little longer before considering John's offer."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and this price is already a good deal compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
