"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try to find a middle ground around $11,000? I think that's a reasonable offer considering your initial asking price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $13,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value you see in the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a bit lower than my initial asking price. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you're placing on the product.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really in the home stretch now. I appreciate your willingness to come down, and I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?  That seems like a fair and final offer.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. However, $11,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,500. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,9,
