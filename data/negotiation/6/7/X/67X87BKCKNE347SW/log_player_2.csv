# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, for the price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both understand it holds.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially since Alice's starting offer is above your maximum value."

This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $980,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and allows us to move forward.  Let me know if you're interested.

Alice has come down to $980,000, which is within my budget and a good compromise. Accepting this offer saves me $20,000 compared to buying from John."
