"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my own research and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product.  While $1,250,000 is certainly attractive, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
