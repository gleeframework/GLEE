Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so this is my floor.
* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay $1,500,000. This is my guaranteed safety net.
* **Potential upside:** I want to try and get more than John's offer, but I don't know what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation space:**  I've set the price at $1,800,000, which is a significant amount higher than my minimum but not outrageously high. It leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested.

By offering $1,800,000, I'm maximizing my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
