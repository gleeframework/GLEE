"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation as the goal is to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly higher than John's offer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, and there are still rounds available to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $14,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. There's still a good chance I can get closer to my target price and I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $14,000.  This is another compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,800 is getting close to John's offer, I'm still going to hold out for a little more. There are still a few rounds left and I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is my final counteroffer before considering John's offer. If Bob rejects this, I will likely accept John's offer. This offer is only $700 above John's offer, so I'm close to my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting too low for my liking. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer. While it's not ideal, it's still better than getting $12,500 from Bob."
