"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $1,000,000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your willingness to pay $1,000,000, while still recognizing the product's true value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to the product's true value, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,080,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay $1,050,000, while still recognizing the product's value to you.
