# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique and valuable. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're still significantly below your maximum, and there's a chance she might be willing to go even lower.  Let's see if we can squeeze out a bit more."
