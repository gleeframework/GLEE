"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price than $850,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting the value of the product to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'd like to keep negotiating,  $875,000 is a good price. It's higher than John's offer and still leaves Bob happy.  Let's close the deal!"
