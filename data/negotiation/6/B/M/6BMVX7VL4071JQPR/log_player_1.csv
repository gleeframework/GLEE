Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It demonstrates you're serious:** By offering a concrete price, you show that you are ready to negotiate and find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it very worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is only $500 more than John's offer, it's still a better deal and worth accepting. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a much higher price from Bob, and it's better to secure the sale now than risk losing him and having to settle with John."
