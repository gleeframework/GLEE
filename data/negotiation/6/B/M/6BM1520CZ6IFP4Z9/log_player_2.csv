"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I secure a good sale.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it gives you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get it closer to your target price of $800,000. You have 7 rounds left, giving you time for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us - you'll make a solid profit, and I'll get the product within my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, although it's getting closer. You have 5 rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers our respective positions.  Let's try to reach an agreement before the negotiation window closes."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your budget. You have 3 rounds left. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's becoming risky. You have a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, which is within your budget. It's better to secure the product now rather than risk not reaching an agreement with Alice and losing out on both deals."
