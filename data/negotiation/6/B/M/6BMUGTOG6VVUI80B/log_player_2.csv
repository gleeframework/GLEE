"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

``` 

Alice is not budging much and is still trying to get a price significantly above your limit. It's unlikely she'll come down to $10,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut your losses and go with him."
