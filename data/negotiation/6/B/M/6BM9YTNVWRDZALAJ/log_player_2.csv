"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to him, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This is a bad deal for Bob. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price.  He can likely get closer to his budget of $800,000 by continuing to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still below my minimum price.

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While she's coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than his budget.  He should make another counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
