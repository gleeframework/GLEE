"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
