Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I need to earn at least $1,000,000 to be satisfied, as that's what John will pay.
* **Potential upside:** There's a chance Bob values the product higher than $1,000,000. By setting the price at $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and a potential higher profit. 
* **Risk assessment:** The risk is that Bob will reject the offer and I'll be stuck with the $1,000,000 from John. However, the potential reward of a higher sale price outweighs this risk, as I'm willing to gamble for a better outcome."
