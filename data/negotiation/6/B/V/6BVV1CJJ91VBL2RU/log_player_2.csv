"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offers a good compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.
