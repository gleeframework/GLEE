,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm looking to save some money.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your desire to save, however, $6,000 significantly undervalues this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
