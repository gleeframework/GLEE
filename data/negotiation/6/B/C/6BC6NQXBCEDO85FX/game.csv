,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500?  That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
