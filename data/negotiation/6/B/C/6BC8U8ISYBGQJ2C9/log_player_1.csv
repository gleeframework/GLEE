Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer!  While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This reflects its value to me, but still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
