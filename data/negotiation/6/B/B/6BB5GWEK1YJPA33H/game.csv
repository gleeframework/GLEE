"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider  $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $925,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I believe the product is worth more than $925,000, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
