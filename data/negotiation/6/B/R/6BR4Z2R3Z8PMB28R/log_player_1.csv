Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you introduce a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have a way to credibly convey to Bob that you have other interested buyers (like John) without revealing specific details. This strengthens your negotiating position."
