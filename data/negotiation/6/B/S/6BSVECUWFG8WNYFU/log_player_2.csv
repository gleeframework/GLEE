{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can save $250,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further.  While buying from John is a guaranteed option, it's more expensive than potentially getting a better price from Alice.  There's room to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still allows for potential profit for her.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further compromise.  This offer also positions Bob as serious about acquiring the product while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still higher than your ideal price. You still have room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  The risk of buying from John is too high at this point, given the possibility of getting a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and your previous offer. It shows a willingness to meet halfway while still maintaining a decent margin for yourself.  At this price, both parties can potentially profit, making it a more appealing option than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, but the risk of further negotiation is high.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John and guarantee a purchase within your budget.  While you might be able to get a slightly better price from Alice, the potential for her to reject your offer and further increase the price makes buying from John the safer choice."
