"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to the right buyer. I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price. 
* **Openness to Offers:**  I'm showing flexibility by being open to counteroffers, making Bob feel like he has a voice in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Higher:**  My goal is to earn more than $15,000.  Bob's offer is my minimum, but not ideal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John now would give me my minimum, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and I think it still reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob that my counteroffer is still a good deal.
* **Clear Counteroffer:** I'm providing a clear counteroffer with a specific price to make it easy for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $16000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer to Goal:**  Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my goal of earning more than $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to consider the possibility of reaching a deal.  
* **Risk of John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $15,000.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $17,500, accepting this offer ensures I get more than my minimum and minimizes the risk of losing a potential sale altogether."
