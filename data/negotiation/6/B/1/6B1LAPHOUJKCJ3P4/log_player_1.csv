Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, encouraging Bob to engage in further conversation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel he has a say in the final price.

By starting high and gauging Bob's interest, you maximize your chances of either securing a deal above your minimum price or moving on to John with no loss."
