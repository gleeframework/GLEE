"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,800.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $10,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,700. This is my final offer,  let me know if you're interested.",10700.0,Alice,5,
