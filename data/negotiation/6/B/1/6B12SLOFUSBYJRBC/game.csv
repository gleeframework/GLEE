"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you will be significant. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of this product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is still a great deal for a product that has the potential to be extremely valuable to you.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
