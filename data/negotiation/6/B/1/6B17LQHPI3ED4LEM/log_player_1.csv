Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while still ensuring he's likely to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so any offer above that has the potential to be accepted.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup guarantees you'll get at least $120.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($120) at $119 creates a sense of a deal for Bob while maximizing your potential profit.

This approach aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob to accept the offer and ensuring you get the best possible price."
