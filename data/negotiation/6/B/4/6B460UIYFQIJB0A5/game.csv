"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,250,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000? It's already at the price I was considering buying from John, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
