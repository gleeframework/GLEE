I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can always adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or go with John's guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$90 is too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than $90, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer $115. It's a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit closer to my desired price."
