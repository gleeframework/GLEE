Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and framing the offer as a win-win. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm prepared to negotiate further. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still potentially make a profit by working with him or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Counter-Negotiation:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I still see room for negotiation.  There's a chance we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a fallback option, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that is drastically below my minimum.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $1,000,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the value he'll gain from the product, hoping to sway him towards accepting this offer. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** While $1,000,000 is my current target, I'm still open to some negotiation. This approach keeps the door open for a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from selling it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 I need to make this worthwhile.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  I'm not ready to accept a price this low. I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially since I have John's offer as a backup. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than its value to me.

I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.  Let's settle on $1,025,000.  This way, we both can walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final attempt to meet in the middle, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Gain:** I'm framing it as a win-win situation where both of us will be happy with the outcome. 
* **Clear Deadline:**  This offer subtly suggests that if Bob doesn't accept, I might be more inclined to take John's offer, adding a bit of pressure. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to seal the deal with Bob.  If not, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from selling it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate or further price reductions, potentially costing me both time and money.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,200,000, which meets my minimum requirements and ensures a positive outcome.

Given the circumstances, I've decided to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
