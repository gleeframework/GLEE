"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. This is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value and demand.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1800000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1400000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to make a profit. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I need a bit more to feel comfortable. My revised offer is $1750000.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $1700000.
