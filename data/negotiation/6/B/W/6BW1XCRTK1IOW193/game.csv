"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. My initial offer is $1000000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is capped at $1500000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
