"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it makes sense to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to meet you halfway, considering the value both you and I place on this item. Therefore, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his desired price."
