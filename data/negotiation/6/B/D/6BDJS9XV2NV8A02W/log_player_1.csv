Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $100 might make Bob balk and go elsewhere.

This strategy aims to secure a good profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
