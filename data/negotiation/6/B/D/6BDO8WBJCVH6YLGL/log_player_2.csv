It's too expensive!  Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal."

I'm offering $900,000. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm not going to overpay."

Alice's offer is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial counteroffer, but I'm not going to pay that much. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Alice is getting closer, but it's getting late in the game. I'm not sure I can get her down to my price.  To guarantee I get the product, I'll take John's offer."
