I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I have a guaranteed alternative with John. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a profit above my minimum threshold. I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction will be!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, especially since I know my product is worth more to me. I'll counteroffer and see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to lower the price a bit, but still keeping it well above my minimum threshold. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not desperate. Hopefully, this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to accept. While I'm not eager to sell to John, I'm also not willing to risk going even lower with Bob and potentially end up with less than my minimum goal. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 with John."
