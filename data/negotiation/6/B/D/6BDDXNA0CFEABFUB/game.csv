"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
