"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product while giving you a significant saving.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I think this would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this point. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
