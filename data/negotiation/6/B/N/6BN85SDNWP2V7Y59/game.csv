"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $900,000 undervalues the significant potential this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",950000.0,Bob,4,
