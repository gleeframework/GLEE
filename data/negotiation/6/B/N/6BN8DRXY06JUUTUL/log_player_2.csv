Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that it's a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000, which is a compromise that still reflects its value while also allowing you to get a good deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1125000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He's also been through several rounds of negotiation and it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go any lower. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing the lowest possible price and avoiding further negotiation."
