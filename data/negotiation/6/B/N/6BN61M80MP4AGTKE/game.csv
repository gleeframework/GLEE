"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a lower price than I initially offered, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let me know your final decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
