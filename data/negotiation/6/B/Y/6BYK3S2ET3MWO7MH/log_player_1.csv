Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Believable:** $11,999 is a very slight discount from John's price, making it more likely Bob will consider it a serious offer.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $11,999 price point feels significantly lower than $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $11,999, which is the absolute maximum you can achieve.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed sale."
