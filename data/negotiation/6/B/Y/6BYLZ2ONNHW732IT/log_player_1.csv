Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a little too high for me.  I could meet you at $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $7,500 is a $4,500 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
