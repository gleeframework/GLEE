"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $80 to her, I'm willing to pay a bit more than half of that, but I'm not willing to pay the full $95.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your offer, but $42.50 is too low for me.  Could you do $87.50?  That's splitting the difference between our original prices. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:

I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's willing to sell the product for $87.50, I'll try to meet her halfway. I'll offer $82.50, which is $5 less than her last offer.
