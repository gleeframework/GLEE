"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price that I think is fair for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing my options, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter offer, but the price is still a little high for me.  How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
