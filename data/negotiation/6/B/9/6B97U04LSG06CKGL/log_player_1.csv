"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price of $2,200,000 sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while keeping the offer significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Confidence & Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly stating why Bob should pay more than his perceived value. This encourages him to justify his counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob into the negotiation and making it clear that you are willing to hear his perspective.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Potentially secure a deal much closer to your asking price.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how interested he is and his potential price range.

It's important to remember we have the backup offer from John, giving us leverage to walk away if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,500,000) and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is tempting, we still have room to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy for Next Round:**

In the next round, we should propose a counteroffer that is still above your minimum but acknowledges Bob's attempt to find a middle ground. A price around $1,800,000 could be a strategic starting point for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm always willing to work with serious buyers. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer while firmly reiterating that your price is based on the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering the price by $400,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. 
* **Justification:**  By reiterating the product's value, you subtly encourage Bob to justify any further counteroffers closer to his initial valuation.

We are still in a good position to negotiate a favorable deal, but we also keep in mind the option to sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher amount, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal. 

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential for Bob to walk away in further rounds."
