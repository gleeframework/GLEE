"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm always willing to work with serious buyers. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
