"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This reflects a fair compromise considering its value proposition.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm encouraged that we're finding common ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to accept $1,210,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
