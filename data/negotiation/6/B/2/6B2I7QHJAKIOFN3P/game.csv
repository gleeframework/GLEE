"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $12,000? That's my final offer, and it's what I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
