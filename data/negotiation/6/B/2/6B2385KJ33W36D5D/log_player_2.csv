"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us.  How about $90? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is a bit steep. While she claims it's worth $100 to me, I know my budget is $100, and I can get it from John at that price. There's a chance Alice might come down in price if I reject this offer."
