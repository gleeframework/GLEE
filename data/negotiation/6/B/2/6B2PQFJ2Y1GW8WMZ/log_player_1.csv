""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it at $1,000,000. This presents a chance to make a significantly higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a significant portion of the potential value ($75,000) on the table for Bob, making it a tempting offer. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  By offering a price that benefits Bob significantly, we increase the likelihood of a quick sale, avoiding potential delays or complications with other buyers.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with the buyer who values the product the most."
