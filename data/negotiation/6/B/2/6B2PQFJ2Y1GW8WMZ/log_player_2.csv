"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is below your maximum budget, you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer might push Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
