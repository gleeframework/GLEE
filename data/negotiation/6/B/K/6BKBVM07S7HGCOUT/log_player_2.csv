"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: 

While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get it for a bit lower. How about $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. Considering your offer and the value of the product, I would like to counter with a price of $9,200. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

While $9,200 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my goal. Would you be willing to accept $9,100? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway. I would like to suggest a price of $9,150 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

Alice has come down to $9,150, which is very close to Bob's desired price of $9,100. It's a good deal for Bob, and he's likely to save more money by accepting this offer than by continuing to negotiate or buying from John. There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and Bob might end up paying more or having to buy from John."
