"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  I'll sell you the product for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  How about $11,200 and we have a deal?",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm only willing to go down to $11,300. This is my final offer. If you accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",11300.0,Alice,7,
