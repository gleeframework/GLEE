"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me.  While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for me. I can save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While I might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
