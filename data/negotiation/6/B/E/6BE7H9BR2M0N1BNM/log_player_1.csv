"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is considerably below its worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects its unique nature."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below the product's value to both Alice and Bob. While John offers a safe $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this purchase, and I want to make this work. Let's settle this right now: $1,125,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer is a clear split of the difference between Bob's last offer ($950,000) and Alice's previous offer ($1,300,000). It signals a willingness to compromise but holds firm on a price significantly above John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it a ""final offer,"" Alice introduces a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, it establishes a strong point for Alice if she needs to concede a bit in the next round while staying above the $1,000,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,125,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better deal. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a solid profit over John's standing offer of $1,000,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or Alice misjudging the situation and losing out on both offers. 
* **Time Value:**  While there are still rounds left, closing the deal now secures the profit and avoids potential delays or complications that could arise later."
