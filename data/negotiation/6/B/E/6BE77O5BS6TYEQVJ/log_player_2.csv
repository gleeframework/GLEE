# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures a win-win for both of us.

You're still over your target price of $1,200,000, so keep negotiating with Alice. You can likely get the price lower."
