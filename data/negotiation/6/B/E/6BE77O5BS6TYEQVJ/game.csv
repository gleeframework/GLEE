"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while giving you a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures a win-win for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
