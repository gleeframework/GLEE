Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to buy. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  Offering it at $100 or less would be a loss for Alice since she has a guaranteed buyer at $150.
* **Below Alice's Minimum:** Offering it at or above $150 is risky, as Bob likely won't pay more than his perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still giving Alice a good profit margin."
