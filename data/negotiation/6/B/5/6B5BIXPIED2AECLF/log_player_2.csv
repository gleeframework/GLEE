Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $18,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we settle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
