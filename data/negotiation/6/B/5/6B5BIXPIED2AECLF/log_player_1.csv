Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $22,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I could let it go for $18,000."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and my budget, and I hope we can find common ground.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Bob is unlikely to go above $14,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
