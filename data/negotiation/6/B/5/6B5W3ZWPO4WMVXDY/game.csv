"Alice, your offer is very tempting, but unfortunately it's a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $1500000 for it.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1650000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to acquire this product without breaking the bank.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer you $1600000, which is a significant amount and a fair price considering my budget. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
