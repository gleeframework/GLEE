"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that has been meticulously crafted and tailored to meet your specific needs. This product holds immense value to me, but I believe it would be an even greater asset in your hands. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a price of $800,000, which I believe is a fair valuation considering its worth to both of us. Should you choose to accept this offer, it would not only bring significant benefits to you but also ensure a substantial return on my investment. I look forward to discussing the details further and potentially welcoming you as the proud owner of this remarkable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $800,000, which is less than your $1,000,000 maximum and significantly less than John's $1,000,000 offer. Accepting this offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
