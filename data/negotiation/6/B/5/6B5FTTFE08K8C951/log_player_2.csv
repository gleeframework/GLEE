"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000.  It's a one-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth at least $15,000 to her, but she's offering it to me for $20,000. I can get the product from John for $8,000, which is a much better deal.
