{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit, and this price is higher than your minimum.
* **It's reasonable for Bob:** The price is close to the value Bob places on the product, making it more likely he'll consider it. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have space to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but also room to increase the price if you feel you can. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's still above your minimum, it's a significant drop from your initial offer.  You want to try to get closer to your target price.  By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if you can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:** It's not your original price, but it's also not Bob's low offer. 
* **It's still profitable:**  $1,125,000 is above your minimum and gets you closer to your ideal price.
* **It shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that be feasible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still quite far from your desired price.  You've already shown flexibility by compromising, but Bob's offer is still too low.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially pushing him closer to your target price. You still have room to negotiate without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a smaller gap:**  The difference between your offer and Bob's is now only $50,000, making it more likely he'll agree.
* **It's still profitable:** $1,100,000 is well above your minimum and brings you closer to your target price.
* **It shows a willingness to compromise:** It demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect your position. Let's make this our final exchange - how about $1,075,000? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,075,000 is very close to your minimum, it's still not quite where you want to be. It's important to remember that John is a secure alternative buyer at your minimum price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make one final counteroffer before considering John.  You have the leverage to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop to $1,090,000. It's a small difference, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a small concession:** You're only dropping $10,000 from your previous offer, signaling that you're serious about a deal but not willing to budge much further.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $1,090,000 is still a good profit and is significantly above your minimum price.
* **It sets a deadline:**  You've framed this as your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal altogether.

Let's see how Bob responds to this final offer!"
