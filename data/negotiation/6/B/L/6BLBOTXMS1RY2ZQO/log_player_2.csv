Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your firm offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop to $1,090,000. It's a small difference, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.

Alice has come down considerably and is signaling this is her final offer.  While I could push further, there's a risk she'll walk away. Accepting at $1,090,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
