"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that be feasible for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect your position. Let's make this our final exchange - how about $1,075,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firm offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop to $1,090,000. It's a small difference, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. ",1090000.0,Alice,7,
