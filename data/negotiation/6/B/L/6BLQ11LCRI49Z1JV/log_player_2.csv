"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment while also giving you a fantastic deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand it's a tough negotiation, but I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still gives me a reasonable return on my investment, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?
