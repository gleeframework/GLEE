"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000,  considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While I value the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value you place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still not a price I can accept. Let's try $850,000. It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
