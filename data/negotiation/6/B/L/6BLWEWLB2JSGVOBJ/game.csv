,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate it, $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $155 for the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? That's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can do $147, which is still a good compromise. What do you think?",147.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $147 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ $145.  It's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $145. I can do $148, which is still a bit higher than what I'd like to get, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",148.0,Alice,7,
