Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and John's offer ($80). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($30).
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John's offer of $80, ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
