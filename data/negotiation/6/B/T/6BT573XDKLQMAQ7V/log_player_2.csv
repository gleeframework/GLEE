"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to lower the price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You can always go to John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, a price that's still fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $920,000. I think this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **You've already made a counteroffer.** There's a chance Alice will come down further if you reject again.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always go to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still out of my range.  To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your increased offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $875,000, so I'm offering $897,500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $897,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $897,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but not enough.**  $897,500 is still above your comfort zone.
* **You have 5 rounds left.**  There's still time to try and push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.**  It's a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $897,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $885,000? It's a compromise on both our ends, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $885,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $897,500 and $885,000, so I'm offering $891,250. This is a reasonable compromise that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $891,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $891,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.** $891,250 is well within your budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **You have only 3 rounds left.**  It's unlikely you'll get a much lower price with limited time remaining.
* **Buying from John is still a possibility.** You're not desperate, but buying from Alice is the more financially advantageous choice right now."
