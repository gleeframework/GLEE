"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, a price that's still fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $920,000. I think this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still out of my range.  To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal in the next few rounds.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $875,000, so I'm offering $897,500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",897500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $897,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $885,000? It's a compromise on both our ends, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",885000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $885,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $897,500 and $885,000, so I'm offering $891,250. This is a reasonable compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",891250.0,Alice,7,
