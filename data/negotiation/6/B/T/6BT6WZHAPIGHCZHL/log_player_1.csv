Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial pricing, I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,100,000. Let's try $1,075,000 as a compromise. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to secure the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and knows the value of the product.  While $1,075,000 is a good profit, we are still in early rounds and have time to negotiate further.  It's worth risking another round to see if we can get closer to $1,100,000."
