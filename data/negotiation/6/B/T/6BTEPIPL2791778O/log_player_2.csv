"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. Given its high value and quality, this is an excellent opportunity to acquire something truly special at a competitive price. I believe you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to you, meaning you're willing to pay up to that amount.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is less than your maximum but still more than the product's worth to her ($80).
* Rejecting her offer allows you to get the product from John for $100, which is still within your budget. 

Since your goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will result in a lower price."
