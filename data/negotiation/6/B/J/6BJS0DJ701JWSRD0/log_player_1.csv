Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above Alice's minimum. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
