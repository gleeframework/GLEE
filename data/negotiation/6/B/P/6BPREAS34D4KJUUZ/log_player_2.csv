"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. This is a significant value to you, as you've indicated the product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, it's unlikely she'll go lower since she values the product at $800,000.  Accepting her offer saves you $50,000."
