""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below our guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) maximizes our potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can always slightly decrease the price if needed.
* **Perceived Value:** By setting the initial price high, we establish a sense of value for the product. While Bob values it at $12,000, our pricing suggests it's worth considerably more, potentially influencing his perception. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response, we might adjust our price slightly to secure the deal, but always aiming to stay above our minimum of $15,000."
