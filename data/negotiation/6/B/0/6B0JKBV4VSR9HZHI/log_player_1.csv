Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. I believe it offers excellent value, but let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows for potential negotiation and profit maximization. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value leaves space for him to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, ensuring no loss. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup buyer."
