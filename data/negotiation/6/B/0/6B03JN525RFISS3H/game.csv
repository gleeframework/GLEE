"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to achieve my minimum goal while giving you a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $975,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and should be a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need at least $1,025,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow me to reach my minimum goal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer, as it meets your minimum price and is a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
