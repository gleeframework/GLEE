Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this offer is attractive enough to Bob, who values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's above my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $14,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and I hope it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,800. Although it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also close enough to my previous counteroffer that it's likely the best I can get from Bob.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
