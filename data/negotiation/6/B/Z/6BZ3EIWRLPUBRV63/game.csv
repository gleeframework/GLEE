"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer you a deal for $98. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",98.0,Alice,5,
