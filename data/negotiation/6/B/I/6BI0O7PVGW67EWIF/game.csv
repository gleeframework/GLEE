,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value while also leaving room for both of us to profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price recognizes the value of the product while also demonstrating my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, while also leaving room for us both to be satisfied with the deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and ensures both of us walk away with a positive outcome.  I'm hoping you'll agree to this final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm genuinely interested in acquiring this product. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This reflects the value of the product while also providing a fair return for you. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to close the deal without further delays. What do you say?",1260000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. $1,260,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $1,265,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1265000.0,Alice,7,
