Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the features and benefits you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
