{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150), hoping to maximize my profit.  I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate, and I'll be ready to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to make a slightly higher profit, selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum.  This ensures a sure sale and avoids further negotiation."
