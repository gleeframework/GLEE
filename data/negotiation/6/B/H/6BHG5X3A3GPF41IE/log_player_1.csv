Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I think it's a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** I start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential to utilize it, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that I have another buyer (John) waiting in the wings creates a subtle sense of urgency. Bob might be more inclined to accept a higher price if he thinks the opportunity won't last.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to maximize profit while balancing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. If Bob accepts the $1,300,000 offer, I make a significant profit. If he rejects it, I can still rely on John's guaranteed offer."
