"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize her to lower the price."
