Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $15,000.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I want to maximize my profit while still ensuring a sale. Offering $14,000 allows for a significant profit for me ($1,000 more than John's offer), while still being a potential bargain for Bob compared to his valuation. 

This offer creates a win-win scenario, giving Bob a good deal while still getting me closer to my desired price."
