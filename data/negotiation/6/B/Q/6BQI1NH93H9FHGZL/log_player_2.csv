"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $9,500.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're offering, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.**  This is lower than John's price of $10,000.
* **The product is worth $8,000 to Alice.** This means she's willing to sell it for a profit.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  While $9,000 is not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal for Bob. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price than John while still allowing Alice to make a profit."
