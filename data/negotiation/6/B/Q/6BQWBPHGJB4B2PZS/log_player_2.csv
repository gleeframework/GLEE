"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is more than your maximum budget of $150.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

You're starting the negotiation by offering a price that's $45 lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant discount, but still within your budget. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. Since you have more rounds to negotiate, it's worth trying to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
``` 

You're getting closer to your goal.  This offer is only $5 above your maximum, and it shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but still looking for a good deal."
