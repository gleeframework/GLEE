Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if we can negotiate further before considering selling to John.  There are still 6 rounds left, which gives me some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I understand your perspective, $1,350,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $1,425,000 is the lowest I can go. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1425000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $1,425,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are approaching the midway point of the negotiations, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've given him several chances to negotiate, but we haven't reached a mutually agreeable price.  Given the remaining rounds and the value John offers, selling to John ensures a better outcome for me."
