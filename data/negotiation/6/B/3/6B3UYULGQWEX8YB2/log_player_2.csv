"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport is important. My message is friendly and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counteroffer is closer to Alice's ideal price than John's price. This hopefully encourages Alice to negotiate rather than risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but $92.50 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. There's room to haggle further, and I'm aiming to get the price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $87.50. It's a fair offer and would allow me to get a good deal while you still make a decent profit."",
""product_price"": 87.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move towards a compromise. A $2.50 increase signals effort without conceding too much.
* **Justification and Value:** I'm reiterating the fairness of the offer, highlighting the benefits for both parties. This emphasizes a win-win scenario and encourages agreement.
* **Time Constraint:** As rounds progress, I need to balance getting a good deal with the risk of running out of time and resorting to John's offer. A slightly higher offer might accelerate the negotiation process."
