"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, based on my research and its potential value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer is reflective of that. I'm willing to move a bit to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to pay $975,000. This offer is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This reflects a significant concession on my part while still acknowledging the true value of what's being offered.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,012,500 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet at $990,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",990000.0,Bob,6,
