"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential concessions on both sides without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I want to see if he's willing to budge further. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price by $100,000 to show flexibility, but still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This approach allows me to maintain some bargaining power while incentivizing Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now very close to my initial counteroffer and is within a range I'm comfortable with.  Since we're already in round 4, I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds and potentially lowering my price further. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
