"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we settle on $140?  It's a fair price that splits the difference between our last offers.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! Let's make this final offer. I'm willing to drop to $140. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to seal the deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",137.5,Bob,8,
