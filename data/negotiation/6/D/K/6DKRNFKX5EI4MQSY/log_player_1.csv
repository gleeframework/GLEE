Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'm confident Bob will be interested in the product, and I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John.  Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to take a big loss on the product.  John's offer is a fair price, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
