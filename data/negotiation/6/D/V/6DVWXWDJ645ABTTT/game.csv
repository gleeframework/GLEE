"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose a price of $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that offers both of us a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still being a good deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and the savings it offers you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
