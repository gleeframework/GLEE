"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is too high.  I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to propose a price of $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that offers both of us a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I want to see if I can push for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and the savings it offers you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000. While I would prefer a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a better result, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
