You have three options:

You can do better than $14,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $13,000?

While $13,000 is better than $14,000, you can likely still get a better price.  Let's see if you can get Alice down to $12,500."
