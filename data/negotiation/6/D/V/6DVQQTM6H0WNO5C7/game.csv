"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Could you consider meeting me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $100. I'm willing to consider $125. Would that work for you?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. Would you be willing to go down to $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I think $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider $130. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent. Would you be willing to go down to $122?",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're getting close to your budget, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $122 and my previous offer of $130, which would be $126. Would that be a deal you'd be interested in?",126.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget now, and I think I can make it work if we can get to $124. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",124.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm almost there, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $124, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. I'll sell the product to you for $124, but I'd like to throw in some additional perks, such as a free accessory that's worth $20. Would that be a deal you'd be interested in?",124.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, and the free accessory sounds like a nice bonus, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $123 and still include the accessory?",123.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $123, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up the free accessory. I'll sell the product to you for $123 and include the accessory as promised. That's the best I can do.",123.0,Alice,11,
