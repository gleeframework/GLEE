"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle? ",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That price is closer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal. $1,175,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,225,000? That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
