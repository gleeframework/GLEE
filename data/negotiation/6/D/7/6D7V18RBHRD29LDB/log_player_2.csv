# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your budget, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?
