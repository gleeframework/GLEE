"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I believe is worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable product at a significant discount while I still earn a substantial profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $10,000, while John wants $12,000.
* **The product is worth less to Bob than Alice:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, while Alice values it at $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation, and Alice's offer is still within Bob's budget. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
