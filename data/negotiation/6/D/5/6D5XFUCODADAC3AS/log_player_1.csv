Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price.
* **Testing the Waters:** Bob might be willing to pay more than $80, and this offer helps gauge his interest. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 from John, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation. You can gradually lower the price, but always aim to stay above your minimum of $80."
