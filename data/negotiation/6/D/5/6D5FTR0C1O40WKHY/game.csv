"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's aim for a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
