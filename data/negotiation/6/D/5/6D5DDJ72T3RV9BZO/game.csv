"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product represents warrants a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you want a good price for the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair amount.  However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
