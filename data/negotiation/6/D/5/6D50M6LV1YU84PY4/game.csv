"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done some research and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a good middle ground, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
