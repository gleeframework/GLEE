"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is quite a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still hoping we can work out a deal. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but that's my absolute final offer.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,7,
