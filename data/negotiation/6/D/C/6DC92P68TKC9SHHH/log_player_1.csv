{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's estimated value ($1,200,000). It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still securing a profitable sale for me.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly higher price, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response and my willingness to compromise. However, I always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which provides a safety net and prevents me from accepting a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but based on my budget, I am only able to offer $1350000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Gain Leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Explore Options:**  See if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired price, hoping to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $1,400,000?  That would give you a good deal, and still allow me to meet my goals.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from the previous round, showing flexibility but still holding firm above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's price, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate. This could encourage Bob to raise his offer or make a counteroffer closer to mine. At the same time, I'm staying above my minimum price, ensuring that I don't accept a deal that is unfavorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my financial constraints, I can't exceed $1375000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. Let's split the difference. How about $1,387,500? This would be a good middle ground for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1387500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price again, this time to the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate and compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm still emphasizing a collaborative approach, appealing to finding a solution that benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** By meeting in the middle, I demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Finality:** This counteroffer puts the ball in Bob's court. If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John, as the price difference is now smaller and I'm less likely to get a better offer from Bob."
