You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is good, but you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value.

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and this offer is a good compromise.  You're saving $150,000 compared to buying from John, and there's a chance you could continue negotiating down further, but the risk of losing the deal is higher."
