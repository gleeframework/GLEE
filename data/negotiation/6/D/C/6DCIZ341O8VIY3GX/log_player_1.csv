"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a little bit from his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I would like to stay within my budget. Could we agree on $1,110,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal target. I want to see if I can push for a bit higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints. However, I'm confident this product is worth more than $1,110,000. How about we settle at $1,115,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,112,500 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option to ensure I reach my desired profit."
