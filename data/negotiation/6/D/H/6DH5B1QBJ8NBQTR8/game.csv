"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $115? I think that's the best we can do for now.",115.0,Alice,5,
