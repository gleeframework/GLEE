Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me a chance to earn more money while still being within a reasonable range, considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  

This approach balances the potential for a higher profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
