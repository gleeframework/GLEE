"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a considerable discount and allows us to both benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To show my willingness to reach a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
