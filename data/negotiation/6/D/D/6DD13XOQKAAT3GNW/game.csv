"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm willing to compromise and pay a bit more if it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? This would be a good deal for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $97.50 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make one more offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm willing to pay a bit more to get the product, but I'm still looking to save some money.",92.0,Bob,6,
