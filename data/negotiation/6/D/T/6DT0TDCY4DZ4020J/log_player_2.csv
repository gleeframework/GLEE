"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to try negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would be a guaranteed deal, but it might be possible to get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a starting point for negotiation, aiming to find a compromise. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Aggressive but not unrealistic:** A 50% reduction is ambitious, but not impossible. If Alice is genuinely interested in selling, she might be willing to negotiate.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it outright, you'll have a better understanding of her bottom line.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting lower, you have room to increase your offer if necessary, potentially finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget. It's a fair price, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of Alice rejecting it and potentially escalating the price back to her initial offer. 

Since John is selling the product for the same price, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It's a risk-free way to secure the product within your budget."
