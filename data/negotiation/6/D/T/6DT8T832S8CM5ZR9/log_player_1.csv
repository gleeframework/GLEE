Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John will buy the product for your minimum price, you have a guaranteed sale at $150.  Your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's interested, increasing your profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While $140 is more than Bob initially values the product for, it's close enough to entice him if he sees potential value beyond $100. 
 
This offer balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
