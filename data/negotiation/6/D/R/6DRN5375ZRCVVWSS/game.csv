"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle on $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,5,
