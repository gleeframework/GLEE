"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true market value.  To move forward, I could consider $1,400,000. This reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Could we settle somewhere around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. That said, $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we agree on $1,000,000 even? I feel that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
