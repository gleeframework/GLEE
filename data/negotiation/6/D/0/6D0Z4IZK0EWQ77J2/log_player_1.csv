"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let's start our negotiation with that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm opening with $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still leaving a profit margin for me.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit. 
* **Setting the tone:** I'm starting with a friendly and open tone, hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Selling to John at this point would be a better outcome. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** However, I still have 9 rounds left and Bob has shown interest.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm confident you'll agree. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value and emphasizing the benefits of a deal for both of us.
* **Setting a clear price:** My counteroffer is specific and leaves no room for ambiguity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited negotiation time:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $10,000, which is a safe and sure option at this point.  

While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob outweighs the potential of reaching a slightly higher price. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit now."
