"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,900,000. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, though.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my limits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still trying to stay within my budget though. How about $1,400,000? It's a fair middle ground between our last two offers, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
