Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I do think this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This product is truly a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth more than that to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal.

I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
