Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers our baseline ($1,200,000), there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product at $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * **For Alice:**  She earns $100,000 more than John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the chances of securing the deal."
