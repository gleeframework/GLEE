{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a reasonable profit margin for Alice while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's clear that Alice is confident in the value of her product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is trying to maximize her profit. While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than Alice's ideal price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows her to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value of the product for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,100,000 is slightly beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This amount still respects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has been trying to get as much as possible, but this offer is only $50,000 less than her minimum acceptable price, and it's more than she could get from John. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable deal and avoids further negotiation."
