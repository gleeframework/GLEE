Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I'll try to stay within my budget while still getting a fair deal. Could we negotiate the price down to $15,000?

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems firm on $15,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $3,000, which is a reasonable outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
