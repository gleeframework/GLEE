# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You have a safety net with John offering the product for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product sounds interesting. However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I'm genuinely interested, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet at $13500? I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
