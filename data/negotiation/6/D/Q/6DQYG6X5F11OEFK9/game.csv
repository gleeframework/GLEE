"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
