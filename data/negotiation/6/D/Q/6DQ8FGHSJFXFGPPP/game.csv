"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This gives us both some room to compromise. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
