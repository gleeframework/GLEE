,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my value.  I'm offering you the product for $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefit it holds for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $1250000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a final offer from my end, as it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident the product's value will far exceed this price for you. Let me know your decision.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1250000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1275000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  To make this deal work, I'm offering a final compromise of $1325000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  If we don't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to explore other options.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1287500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1287500.0,Bob,8,
