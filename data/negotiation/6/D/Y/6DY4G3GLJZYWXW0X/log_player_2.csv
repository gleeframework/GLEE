"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its true worth.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a significant discount considering its potential value.  Think about it, and let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product is a perfect fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
