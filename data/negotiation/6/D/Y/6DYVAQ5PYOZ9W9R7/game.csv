"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,500? I think it's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $11,250? I think this is a fair price that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the value of the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
