What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $1800000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2200000, which reflects a compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
