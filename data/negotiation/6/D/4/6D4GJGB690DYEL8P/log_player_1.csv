Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. This price aligns more closely with what I can afford while still recognizing the potential value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
