"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it allows for room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal value, but I'm also aware of the risk of losing the deal. If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm aware of the time constraint, selling to John for $1,200,000 right now would be a loss compared to my ideal price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value of $1,200,000 and hopefully more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement. I'm also considering that I have limited rounds left, so I need to start moving towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm considering selling to John, as that would guarantee me my minimum value. However, I still have a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm aiming for a quick deal with Bob to avoid losing the negotiation entirely.  I'm approaching my minimum value, so I need to find a middle ground with Bob soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, and I'm starting to run out of time. With only four rounds left, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might end up with nothing.  Selling to John would guarantee my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
