Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is greater than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $14,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, suggesting a possible deal. 
* **It's not overly aggressive:**  A higher offer could scare Bob off, while a lower offer might leave too much money on the table. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident the product is worth $13,000 to me.  I'm happy to pay that, let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $13,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also closer to your initial offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  While you could try to push for a higher price, accepting his offer secures a sale and a profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher."
