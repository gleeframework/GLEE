"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-value product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down. While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow both of us to be happy with the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,180,000. This is a good midpoint between our previous offers, and I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me here.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,180,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a solid compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me here. However, I want to make it clear that I'm getting close to my limit, and I need to make a decision soon.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round.",1150000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit short of my target, and I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm thinking of a price of $1,225,000. This is a tough compromise for me, but I'm willing to do it if it means getting the deal done. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",1225000.0,Alice,9,
