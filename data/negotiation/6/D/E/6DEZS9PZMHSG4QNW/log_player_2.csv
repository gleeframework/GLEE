Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still leaves plenty of room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.
