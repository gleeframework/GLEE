``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, giving Bob room to negotiate.  It's also below his perceived value, giving him incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counter-offer to see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still leaves plenty of room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
