Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price is still a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is a good start. However, you're still looking to save more money.  By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $750,000."
