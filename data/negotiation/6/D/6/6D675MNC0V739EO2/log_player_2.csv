Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this opportunity with you. I value this product at a minimum of $1,200,000, but to get the ball rolling, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair starting point considering the value it brings.

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? That would be $1,275,000. It's a fair deal that recognizes the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,275,000. Since you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
