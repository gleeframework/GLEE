"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is valuable, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly under the product's value to both of us.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I need to see more movement from his side."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? That would be $1,275,000. It's a fair deal that recognizes the value of this product."",
