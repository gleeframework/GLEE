I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll compromise on $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $12000.  It's the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still committed to your offer of $12000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",13500.0,Alice,7,
