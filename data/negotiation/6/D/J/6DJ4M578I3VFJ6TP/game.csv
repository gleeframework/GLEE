"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
