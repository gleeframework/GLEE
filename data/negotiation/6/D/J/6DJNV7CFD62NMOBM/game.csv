"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This is a very fair price considering the unique value of this product.  I hope you'll reconsider.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go higher than $14000. This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay, and leaves some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. My minimum price for this product is $15000.  It's important for me to get at least that much to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $15000.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",15000.0,Alice,7,
