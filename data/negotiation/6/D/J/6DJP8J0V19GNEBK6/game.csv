"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000? It's still a great price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle? $11,000 would be a good compromise. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,5,
