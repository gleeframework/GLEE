"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would give us both a good profit margin and secure a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that should benefit both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $860,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $880,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer it to you for $872,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",872500.0,Alice,5,
