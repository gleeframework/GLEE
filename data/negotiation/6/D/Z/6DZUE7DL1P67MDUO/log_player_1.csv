Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale for $12,000 with John.

**Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept, but still higher than your minimum. You have leverage because you have a guaranteed buyer.  Therefore, there's no need to go below $12,000.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $12,500.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Direct:** The message directly presents the offer without beating around the bush.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a subtle sense of urgency and value.
* **Fair Pricing:** The price of $12,500 is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still getting you a better price than John's offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Remember, you always have John's offer to fall back on."
