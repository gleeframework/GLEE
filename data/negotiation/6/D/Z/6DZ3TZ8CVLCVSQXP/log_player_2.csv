"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room to negotiate and potentially save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a much lower price than Alice's initial offer. He's hoping to get a deal closer to his ideal price while still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still not the best possible deal. Bob has room to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price closer to his counteroffer of $700,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue exploring better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to his ideal.  By moving closer to Alice's last offer, he's signaling that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a better deal. This strategy aims to encourage Alice to come down in price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a significant drop from her initial price, and is now within a reasonable range for Bob.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob's counteroffers being rejected further increases.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking losing the opportunity entirely."
