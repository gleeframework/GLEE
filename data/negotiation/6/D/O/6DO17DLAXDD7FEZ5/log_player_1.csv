Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 or more to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible, without losing him as a buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $125 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $25 discount from his perceived value.
    * We secure a $25 profit margin, which is significantly better than selling to John for $100.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, justifies the price, and leaves room for negotiation while remaining firm on a reasonable offer."
