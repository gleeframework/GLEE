"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
