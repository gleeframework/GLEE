"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this amount if possible.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $800000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000 if possible.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which I believe represents a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,5,
