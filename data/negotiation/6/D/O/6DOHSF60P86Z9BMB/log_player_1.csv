"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a reasonable markup considering the product is worth $100 to Bob.  This gives me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial asking price. I believe this shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85.  While I'm running out of time, I still believe I can get a better price.  John is a reliable alternative, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm also getting closer to my deadline.  This offer is a final attempt to strike a deal with Bob while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $100. Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm running out of time. It's better to guarantee a profit than risk getting nothing at all by continuing to negotiate."
