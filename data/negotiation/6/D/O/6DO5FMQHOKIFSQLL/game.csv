"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to consider offers up to $850000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000.

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $875000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
