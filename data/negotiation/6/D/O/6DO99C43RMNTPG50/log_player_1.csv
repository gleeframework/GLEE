Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I know you'll find great value in it."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $10,000 leaves a potential $2,000 profit for Bob, making it a tempting offer he's more likely to accept.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so you're not desperate and can aim higher with Bob."
