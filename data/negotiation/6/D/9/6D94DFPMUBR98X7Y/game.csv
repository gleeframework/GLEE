"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of your product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product's value, but $1,225,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,187,500. This is my final offer.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
