"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth $8,000 to you, but it's a great deal for both of us.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go any lower. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. Even though she's willing to negotiate, the price is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You can get the same product from John for a better price."
