Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he has a clear incentive to negotiate and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm confident in the value of the product. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot to finalize the deal."
