"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $1,000,000** would be a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Buying from John for $1,200,000** is the worst-case scenario, so it's best to avoid that if possible.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** allows you to try to get a better price. 

Since you want to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer for $950,000** is a good deal. It's lower than your initial maximum budget of $1,200,000 and you're getting the product for a reasonable price. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** and continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly better price, but it risks losing the deal entirely or ending up with a worse price in the end.
* **Buying from John for $1,200,000** is still the worst-case scenario and should be avoided if possible.

Considering the risk of further negotiation and the opportunity to secure a good deal, accepting Alice's offer of $950,000 is the best option."
