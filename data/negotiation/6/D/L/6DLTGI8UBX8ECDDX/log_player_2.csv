"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. Given its significance and worth, I believe it would greatly benefit someone like yourself. After careful consideration, I propose to sell the product to you for $12,500. This price reflects the product's true value while allowing me to earn a fair return. I look forward to hearing your response and potentially discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **You have room to negotiate:**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that.  You could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, but accepting her offer is still a good deal."
