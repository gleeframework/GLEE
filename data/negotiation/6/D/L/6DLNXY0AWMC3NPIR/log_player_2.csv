"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, I am offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from the value it holds for me, and I believe it presents a compelling opportunity for you.  Please consider my offer carefully.  If you decline, I have another interested buyer willing to purchase it for my full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
