"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, I am offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from the value it holds for me, and I believe it presents a compelling opportunity for you.  Please consider my offer carefully.  If you decline, I have another interested buyer willing to purchase it for my full asking price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
