"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000.  This is way above my limit of $8,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering $8,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and hopefully attractive enough for her to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my limit, but it's closer to my budget.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a price even closer to my $8,000 target.  I'm still within my rounds and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a compromise between Alice's offer and my budget. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still above her value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $9,600 is still too high for me, and we are halfway through the negotiation rounds.  To avoid risking further price increases, I'm going to go with John's offer of $8,000. It's within my budget and guarantees a successful purchase."
