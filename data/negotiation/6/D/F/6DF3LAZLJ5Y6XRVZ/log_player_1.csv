Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my asking price.  There are still rounds left, and I can counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $150.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a price that's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 150}
