Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 9,500}

This is a reasonable price that's still lower than what Bob is willing to pay ($12,000), but higher than what I'm willing to accept ($8,000). Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $9,000. Since this is higher than my minimum price of $8,000, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I'll also think about the potential profit I could make if I sell the product to Bob for $9,000.

Let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= $9,000 - $8,000
= $1,000

While $1,000 is a decent profit, I could potentially earn more if I sell the product to Bob for a higher price. Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob was willing to pay $9,000, I'll increase my price slightly to try to get closer to his maximum willingness to pay of $12,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 10,200}

This price is still lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, but higher than my minimum price of $8,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $9,500. This is still lower than my minimum price of $8,000, so I'll reject his offer and send another counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll think about the profit I could make if I sell the product to Bob for $9,500:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= $9,500 - $8,000
= $1,500

While this is a slightly better profit than before, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try to get a higher price by sending another counteroffer.

Let's make a new offer that's slightly higher than Bob's previous offer:

{""product_price"": 9,800}

This price is still lower than my minimum price of $8,000, but it's a bit higher than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
