"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
