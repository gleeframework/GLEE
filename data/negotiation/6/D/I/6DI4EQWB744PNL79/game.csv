"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in the product, though. Would you be open to $10000?  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a little out of my price range. I'm committed to finding a deal, so how about we split the difference and go with $11500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would get us closer to a final agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay closer to my original offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $12500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
