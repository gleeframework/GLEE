Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation ($120) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, asking for a price too close to Bob's maximum might make him feel like he's getting a bad deal and deter him from buying. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he is willing to pay.
* It's a balancing act between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale to Bob."
