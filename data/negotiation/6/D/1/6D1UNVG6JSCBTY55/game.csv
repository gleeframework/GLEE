"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 for the product.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Bob,4,
