Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works best for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's worth ($15,000 minimum) and that Bob values it at $8,000. Starting with a high offer of $22,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for negotiation, making Bob feel like he has a chance to influence the final price. This can prevent him from immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a secured buyer (John) for $15,000, giving her leverage in the negotiation. She doesn't need to settle for anything less than her minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit. It's essential to remember that negotiation tactics should always be ethical and respectful."
