{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me.  It's worth a significant amount, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident that the return on this investment will be worth far more to you in the long run."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started at or slightly above his valuation.
* **Value Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a high number. I'm emphasizing the product's worth to both of us and framing it as a valuable investment that will yield returns beyond the initial price. 
* **Walk-Away Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.  This gives me leverage to be firm in my negotiations with Bob. I'm willing to walk away from a lower offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. 
* Gauging Bob's personality and negotiation style beforehand could help tailor the message for better results."
