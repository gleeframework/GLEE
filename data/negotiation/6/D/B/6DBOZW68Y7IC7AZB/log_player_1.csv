Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point considering the product's worth to me. I'm hoping to get as close to that price as possible, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob proves to be too difficult to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I would love to get more, it's not worth risking a long negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair price and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum value.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed deal and more than worth the risk of further negotiations."
