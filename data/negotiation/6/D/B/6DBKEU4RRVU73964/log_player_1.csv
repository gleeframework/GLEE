Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and value perception, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Fallback Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
