"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay more, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $150?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to counteroffer at $165. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $155?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is getting closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $160. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $160, but I'm still not sure if that's the best value for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. How about $157.50?",157.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $157.50 is getting very close to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll stick with my previous offer of $160. It's the best price I'm willing to accept for this product.",160.0,Alice,9,
