Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $850,000 for it to make sense on my end. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
