"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $850,000 for it to make sense on my end. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for on the market. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while working for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $925,000. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $975,000 is just a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle this right now at $950,000?  That's a firm offer from my side, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further, but I need to consider other options if we can't agree on a price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
