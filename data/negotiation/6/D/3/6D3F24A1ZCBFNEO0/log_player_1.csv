"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic, framing it as a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer establishes a strong starting point and signals that I'm serious about getting a good price. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate. If he rejects outright, I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's more room for negotiation, especially since Bob acknowledged the product's value in his message.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Explore higher offers:**  A counteroffer from me could push the price closer to my desired range. 
* **Assess Bob's true value:** Observing his willingness to negotiate will help me determine how far I can realistically push the price.

Selling to John is always an option, but I'm confident I can achieve a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable sale for me. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my willingness to negotiate. The message emphasizes the fairness of the proposed price and the mutual benefit of a deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It signals that I'm open to finding common ground, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maximize profit:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, potentially maximizing my earnings.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's reaction will indicate his level of commitment to the deal and help me decide how to proceed in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of your product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $1,025,000 as a compromise. This price still allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've already rejected his previous offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing him as a buyer altogether.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a sale that's only slightly below my minimum. 
* **Time Constraints:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's unwise to risk further negotiation.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price this time, establishing a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities where he's willing to pay more.

While I'm not thrilled about selling for $1,025,000, it's a pragmatic decision given the circumstances."
