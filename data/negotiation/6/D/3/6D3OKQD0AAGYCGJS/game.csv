"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm serious about purchasing, so let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
