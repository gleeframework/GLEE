"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  It's a fair price, considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to the maximum amount he's willing to spend.  Since he can get the product from John for $15,000, it's a good idea to accept the offer and save some time."
