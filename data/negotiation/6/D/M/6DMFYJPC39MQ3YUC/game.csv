"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle!",15500.0,Alice,3,
