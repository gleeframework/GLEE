"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8250.0,Alice,5,
