Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives me leverage.
* **Pricing Strategy:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. This increases the chance he'll accept the offer rather than risk missing out."
