"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it's incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $160, you're aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. While Bob values the product at $80, your initial high price might shift his perception of what's reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price signals that you're willing to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $120. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob explicitly stated he ""can't pay more than $120"".  This suggests further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $120. Accepting Bob's offer or continuing negotiations introduces uncertainty and the risk of ultimately getting a worse deal. 
* **Time Value:** Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round you could be finalizing the sale with John. Time is money, and a sure $120 now outweighs a potential (but uncertain) higher amount later."
