"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by us due to its unique features and high quality. Given its worth to you is $100, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. Let's start with my offer of $110. I look forward to your response.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value I place on this product. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find a happy medium.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. After evaluating the situation, I would like to counter with a price of $107 for the product. This price reflects a compromise while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your feedback.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $107 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $106. This would allow us to finalize the deal and save a bit of time and effort.",106.0,Bob,4,
