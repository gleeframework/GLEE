"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could you consider something around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
