Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $12,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offers. She went up to $14,000, which is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a price that would justify continuing the negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
