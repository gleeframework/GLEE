"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to accept $8,500 for the product. This price reflects the value it offers and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue this conversation.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,000.
