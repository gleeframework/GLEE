{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Counter-Offers:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum ($10,000) with a few counter-offers.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counter-offer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can leverage this interest to push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point. I will aim for a price that is still attractive to Bob but more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to accept $8,500 for the product. This price reflects the value it offers and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing the reason for a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects it, I will need to decide whether to counter-offer again or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Counter-offering again:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating as I believe there's still room to find a mutually beneficial price.  
* **Risk of losing Bob:** I acknowledge the risk of losing Bob as a buyer, but I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob again with a price that is more favorable to me but still within a range I believe he might consider.  I'll need to be strategic and consider the potential for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue this conversation.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $8,000, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing the fact that I'm making a compromise to show that I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Final offer implication:** I'm using language like ""final deal"" to subtly signal that this might be my last offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $10,000. The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is increasing, and I need to balance the potential for a better deal with the risk of losing him altogether."
