"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is selling for, there's still room to negotiate.  You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the product is worth $120 to Alice.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than my initial offer, but it's still lower than what John is selling for. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of slowly working towards a mutually agreeable price.  $135 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.  I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is now the same as what John is selling for.  There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation. I'll buy the product from John for $150.  It's the best price I can get right now, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
