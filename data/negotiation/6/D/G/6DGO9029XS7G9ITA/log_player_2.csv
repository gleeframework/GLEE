Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,250,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's settle on $1,300,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is within my budget and a good deal.  It's getting closer to my target price and it's the best offer I've received from Alice.  I don't want to risk going to John and paying the full $1,500,000.  So I'll accept the offer."
