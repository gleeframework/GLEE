Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Considering your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer $950,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is inching closer, it's clear he's anchored to his $800,000 valuation. Accepting his offer means a $50,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's strategically sound to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
