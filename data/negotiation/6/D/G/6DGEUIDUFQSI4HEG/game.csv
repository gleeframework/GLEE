"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the $1,300,000 price reflects the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. Considering your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer $950,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
