Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation while still ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000, reflecting its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge the product's value to Bob.
* **Confident Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a good profit margin for you while being significantly below Bob's perceived value.
* **No Room for Haggling (Initially):** The firm language suggests this is a well-considered price, not an opening bid.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have room to go down slightly, but don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  Having John as a backup gives you a strong position. If negotiations with Bob fail, you're still covered."
