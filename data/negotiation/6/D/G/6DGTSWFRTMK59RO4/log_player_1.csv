Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $17,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your desired minimum ($15,000) creates room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at high demand (""interest I've had"") to justify the price without being overly aggressive.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You make a profit of $2,000 more than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You can potentially settle on a price between $15,000 and $17,000, still earning more than your guaranteed sale.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum price. 
 
This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit while leaving room for a successful negotiation with Bob."
