Bob's offer:

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $900,000.  It's too low and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer."

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $1,000,000, it's a safer bet than continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's no guarantee that he'll increase his offer, and I'm risking losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
