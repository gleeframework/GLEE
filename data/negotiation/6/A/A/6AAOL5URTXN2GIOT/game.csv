"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my valuation. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still allows me to make a profit and hopefully makes it attractive for you as well. Let's try to find a middle ground!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. I hope we can reach a satisfactory agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
