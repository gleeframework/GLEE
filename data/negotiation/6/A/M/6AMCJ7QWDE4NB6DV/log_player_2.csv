# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our flagship product, which holds immense value to me due to its unique features and personal significance. Given its importance to me, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9500. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire a product that would be worth $8000 to you, at a premium that reflects its exceptional quality and my commitment to finding the right buyer. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or making an offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than his maximum budget.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $8,000."
