"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that is worth more than its face value to you. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product while allowing us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This price is still fair and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your proposal, I am able to consider a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome, with a price that reflects the value of the product while remaining competitive.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counter-offer and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price."
