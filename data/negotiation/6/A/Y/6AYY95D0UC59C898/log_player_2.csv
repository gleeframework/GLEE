{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to signal my seriousness about negotiation and to establish a lower price range. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget while still leaving room for potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal. It's also important to keep in mind that I can always buy from John for $8,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's at my maximum budget and aligns with John's price. I'm hoping Alice recognizes that this is a fair price for both of us and accepts. If she rejects, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
