"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $12,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should buy from John.  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price. Since John is willing to sell for Bob's maximum, it's the best option for him."
