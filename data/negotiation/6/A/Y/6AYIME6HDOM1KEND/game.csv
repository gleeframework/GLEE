"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my asking price and provides you with a good value.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would give you a good return on your investment and allow me to acquire it within my financial limits. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives you a great deal. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
