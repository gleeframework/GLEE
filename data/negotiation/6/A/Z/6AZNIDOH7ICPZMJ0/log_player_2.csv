"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $15,000.

At $11,500, Bob is getting a significantly better price than from John. While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
