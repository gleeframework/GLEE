{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than $10,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I value the product at more than $12,500, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This still leaves room for me to make a profit, and I'm hoping it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $11000, but I really like the product and I think it's worth it to me. Can you meet me at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly, and while $12,000 is not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum than what John is offering. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
