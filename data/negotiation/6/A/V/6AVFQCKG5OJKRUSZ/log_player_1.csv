Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $140, but I'm open to negotiation."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Since John is guaranteed to buy it at that price, there's no risk in starting high.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he counters. 
* **Avoid Appearing Too Greedy:** While we could start at $150, it might put Bob off and make him less likely to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is in a no-loss situation as she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
