"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $13500? This would still be a great deal for a product of this caliber, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to cover costs, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make the purchase without breaking my budget. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
