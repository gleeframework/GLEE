"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $8250? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $7500? I think it's a fair compromise, and I'd love to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7500. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not quite ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $8000? It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8000.0,Alice,5,
