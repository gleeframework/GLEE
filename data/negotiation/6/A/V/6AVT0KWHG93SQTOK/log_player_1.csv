Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This helps to build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:** By starting high, I hope to get closer to Bob's potential valuation.
* **Maintain leverage:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? I appreciate your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher earnings:**  There's a chance that Bob is willing to pay more than $15,000. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a better deal.
* **Leverage:** I know John is willing to pay $12,000, which gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget considerations.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,500.  This is still a good value for you, considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've countered with $16,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $18,000 and Bob's offer of $15,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good price.
* **Message:**  I've acknowledged Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the product's value. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone during negotiations. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and remaining open to a deal. This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable option while allowing me to potentially secure a better outcome than John's $12,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still working within a tight budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $15500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $15,500 is very close to my initial asking price of $16,500. It's also significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure a good price for the product. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:**  $15,500 is a strong price, especially considering my minimum value was $12,000. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price, and I'm already in a good position with Bob's offer.
* **Risk mitigation:** By accepting Bob's offer, I avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price."
