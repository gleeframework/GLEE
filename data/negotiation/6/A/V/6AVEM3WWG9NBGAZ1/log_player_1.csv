Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob immediately. It's stronger to negotiate as if Bob is your primary option.

If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can then negotiate down, potentially settling around $9,000. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still ensuring a sale."
