"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great deal considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still below what it's worth to me but reflects your budget more realistically.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to close at $900,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's split the difference. I'm offering to sell you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still a bit above my target.  I'm firm on $900,000.  Let's close this deal, as we're both getting closer to a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
