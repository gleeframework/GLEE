"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great deal considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are confident in your product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to accept this offer right now. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still below what it's worth to me but reflects your budget more realistically.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to close at $900,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a bit longer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll consider selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's split the difference. I'm offering to sell you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still a bit above my target.  I'm firm on $900,000.  Let's close this deal, as we're both getting closer to a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on $900,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $950,000.  With only four rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a sure thing, and it meets my minimum price point."
