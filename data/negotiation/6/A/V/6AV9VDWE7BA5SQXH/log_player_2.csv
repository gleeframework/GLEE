Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still below what it's worth to me but reflects your budget more realistically.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.
