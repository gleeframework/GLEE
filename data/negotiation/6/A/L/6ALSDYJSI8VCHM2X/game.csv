"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $155. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
