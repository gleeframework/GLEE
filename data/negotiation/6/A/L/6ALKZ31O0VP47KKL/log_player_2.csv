"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your target price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range. It leaves room to gradually increase while aiming for a price significantly below John's $120 offer.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely and acknowledges Alice's offer. This sets a positive tone for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but her offer of $125 is still higher than John's offer of $120. There's a chance to negotiate a slightly better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise by splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($125) and our previous offer ($100). This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation forward. 
* **Still Below John:**  This price point keeps us below John's offer, leaving room for a final push if needed while still potentially securing a deal with Alice. 
* **Positive Language:**  Maintaining a positive and understanding tone throughout the negotiation increases the likelihood of a mutually agreeable outcome."
