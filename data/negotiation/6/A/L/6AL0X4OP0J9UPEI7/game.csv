,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,300,000? That would allow both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
