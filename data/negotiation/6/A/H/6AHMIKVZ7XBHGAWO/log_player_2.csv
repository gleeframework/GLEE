"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to start by offering my maximum price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my clear upper limit and forces Alice to consider a significant compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again.  I have a few more rounds to work with and there's a chance Alice might be more willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal, as she has already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting close to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again. I only have a few rounds left, but I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly to $9,250. This demonstrates that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I'm also sticking to my budget.  With only four rounds left, the pressure is on both of us to reach a deal."
