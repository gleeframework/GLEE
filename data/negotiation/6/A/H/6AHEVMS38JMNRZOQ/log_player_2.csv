"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm happy to pay $8,250 for the product. This is the absolute most I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,625. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,625

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be fair here. While I appreciate the offer, $8,625 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,400 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about getting a good deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $8,600, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've negotiated hard and gotten Alice close to your target, but you're still $600 above your goal.  At this point, it's likely Alice won't budge much further, and you're running out of rounds.  It's better to secure the product for $8,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a price you're not happy with."
