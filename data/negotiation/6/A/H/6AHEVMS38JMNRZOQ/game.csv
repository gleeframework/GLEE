"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I can match this price in the future.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm happy to pay $8,250 for the product. This is the absolute most I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,625. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it worth the investment.",8625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be fair here. While I appreciate the offer, $8,625 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,400 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about getting a good deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $8,600, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8600.0,Alice,7,
