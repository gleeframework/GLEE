"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $950000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more to make this work for me. How about $975000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think $925000 would be a more reasonable price for me. Can we meet in the middle at $950000 is too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950000. Let's try $925000",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the potential this product holds for your business, I'm confident that $950000 would be a worthwhile investment. Would you be willing to reconsider that amount?  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think $950000 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above $925000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $927500. Can we make a deal at that price?",927500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $927500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $940000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $940000, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $927500 and $940000, which is $933750. Can we make a deal at that price?",933750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $936875. This price would allow us to finalize this deal and ensure both of us are happy.  Let's get this done!",936875.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $936875. I'm willing to make one final offer of $930000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",930000.0,Bob,10,
