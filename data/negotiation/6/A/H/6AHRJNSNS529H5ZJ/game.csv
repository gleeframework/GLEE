"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique value of your product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12500, meeting you halfway.  This price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  Given our previous discussions, I'm prepared to offer $11500.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed.",11500.0,Bob,4,
