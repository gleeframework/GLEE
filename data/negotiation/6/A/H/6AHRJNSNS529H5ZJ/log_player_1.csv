"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique piece with a lot of value, and I believe you'll appreciate its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to establish a starting point, and this price gives Bob an incentive to counter-offer, opening up the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique value of your product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, meeting you halfway.  This price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me.  Given our previous discussions, I'm prepared to offer $11500.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
