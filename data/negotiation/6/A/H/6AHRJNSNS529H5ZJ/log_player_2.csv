"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a unique piece with a lot of value, and I believe you'll appreciate its potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $15,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique value of your product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12500, meeting you halfway.  This price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above his maximum value of $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  Given our previous discussions, I'm prepared to offer $11,500.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed."", ""product_price"": 11500}
