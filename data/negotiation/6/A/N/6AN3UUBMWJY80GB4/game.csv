"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $16,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $16,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for such a valuable product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
