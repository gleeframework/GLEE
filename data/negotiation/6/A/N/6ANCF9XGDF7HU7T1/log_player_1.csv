Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), you have room to start higher with Bob. This leaves space for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest level. His response will help you understand if he's open to negotiating closer to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""worth and potential"" subtly justifies the high initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower, but still above your minimum.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might outright reject your initial offer, but you can then counter with a lower price, still aiming to stay above $15,000."
