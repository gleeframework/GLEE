Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting high, we can get a sense of Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects the offer, we know we need to come down significantly. If he counters, we can get a better idea of his price range. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the safety net of John, who will buy the product for $80. This gives us leverage in the negotiation, as we're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value for the product.  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. 

By rejecting, we signal that we're serious about the value of the product and open the door for further negotiation. We'll aim for a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, but Above Minimum:** We've come down $20 from our initial offer, showing flexibility. However, we're still well above Bob's lowball offer and above our absolute minimum. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's true interest. If he's genuinely interested but price-sensitive, he'll likely counter again. If he walks away, it might indicate he wasn't serious about purchasing at a reasonable price. 
* **John as Backup:** We still have John as a guaranteed sale at $80. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think $80 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $80. While we could try to negotiate for a bit more, it's unlikely he'll go much higher since he's already stated that he values the product at $80.  

Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a price we find acceptable and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely if we push for more."
