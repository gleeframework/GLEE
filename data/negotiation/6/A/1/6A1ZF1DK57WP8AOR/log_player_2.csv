"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to you is also $120. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $120 to both Bob and Alice, Bob can always buy it from John for that price. There's no incentive for Bob to accept Alice's offer at this point. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to let it go for $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I need to maintain the product's value. I can't go below $120. However, I'm willing to negotiate slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $110 is still more than Bob's ideal, it's a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $10 compared to buying from John."
