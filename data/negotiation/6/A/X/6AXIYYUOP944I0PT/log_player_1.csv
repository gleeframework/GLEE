Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is below Bob's perceived value of $150, making it a potentially attractive deal for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price based on Bob's response, giving you some flexibility. 

Let me know what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is less than my initial offer, it's still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum price of $80 and I don't want to risk Bob walking away entirely."
