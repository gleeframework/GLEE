I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $15,000 from John, leaving room for negotiation. By starting high, I can see if Bob is genuinely interested and potentially willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
