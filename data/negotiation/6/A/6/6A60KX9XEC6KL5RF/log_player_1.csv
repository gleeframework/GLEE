Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum while still leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that's more beneficial to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still above Bob's initial valuation, but closer to what I need to make a profit.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting closer to my minimum value and I risk losing time.  John offers a guaranteed deal at my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
