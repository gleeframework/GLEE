"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is under your $120 limit, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price, getting you closer to her $80 valuation. If not, you can always buy from John for $120."
