"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you consider $11,500? That would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $9,500. This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay and what you're looking to get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
