"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative. How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $760,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer it to you for $820,000. This is my best and final offer on the higher end, but I'm willing to consider it.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your best offer on the higher end. To be fair to us both, I could meet you at $780,000. It's a significant investment for me, and I feel this is a fair compromise.",780000.0,Bob,6,
