Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

At $650,000, we're getting a significant discount ($350,000).  Alice seems firm on this being her lowest price. It's risky to push further and risk her walking away, leaving us to buy from John at full price."
