"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  To make this deal work, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm understanding that your budget has limitations, but  $1,100,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
