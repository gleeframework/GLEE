"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain a certain margin for the product. I am unable to accept $85 for the item. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a margin, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87. This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you, while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",87.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $89 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit while remaining competitive within your budget.",89.0,Alice,5,
