Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's important to note that I'm taking a risk by not immediately accepting John's offer, as he's guaranteed to buy. However, I believe that a higher price from Bob is possible, and I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can achieve it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept and get something, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price of $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also higher than what John is offering, and it's uncertain if I can get a better deal with Bob in future rounds. To avoid risking losing a sale completely, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
