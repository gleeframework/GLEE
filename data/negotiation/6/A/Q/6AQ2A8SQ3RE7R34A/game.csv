"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the initial offer, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise given the current market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties involved.",950000.0,Bob,4,
