Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $125 for it. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for $100 if we can't agree."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can offer you a slight discount at $140, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
