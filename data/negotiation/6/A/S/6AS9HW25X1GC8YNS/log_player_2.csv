Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,100,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping to get it down a little further.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000.  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000, and I think this price reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is a good deal. While I could potentially negotiate further, I'm confident I can't get a much better price and we're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation.  Accepting this offer saves me $420,000 compared to buying from John, so it's a good deal overall."
