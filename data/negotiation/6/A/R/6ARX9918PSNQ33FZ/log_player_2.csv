{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $15,000 to Alice, but she's asking for $20,000.  This is a very high starting price, and Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
