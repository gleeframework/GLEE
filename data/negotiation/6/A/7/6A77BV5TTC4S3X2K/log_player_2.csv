"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's start with my initial offer at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, you can likely get it for less. You are aiming for a price below $100, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are also firm about your price point.  It allows for room to negotiate upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $100 for the product? I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly your budget limit.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject a lower offer and you'll end up paying more.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for your target price."
