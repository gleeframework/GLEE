Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is still significantly more than my minimum. Accepting ensures I get a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
