"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a substantial saving while ensuring I receive a fair return. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
