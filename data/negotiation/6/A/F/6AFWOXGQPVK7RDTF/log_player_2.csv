"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, I propose a price of $95 for this exceptional product. Thank you for considering this opportunity, and I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is higher than what you're willing to pay ($100) and significantly higher than her own valuation ($80). 
* You have a better alternative: buying from John for $100. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with buying from John, saving yourself $5."
