You can likely get the product for less than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if we can find a middle ground.  It's still a good deal for Alice, as it's well above her minimum value, and it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price, and it's only $1,000 more than John's offer.  At this point, it's worth accepting and ending the negotiation."
