"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a fair price that allows for some negotiation, but still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $90 at the moment. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product.  I can come down a bit to $100. That's still a fair price for this product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
I'm countering with $100. This is a compromise that should be attractive to Bob, as it's closer to his offer. I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $95 is a good deal, and it's important to be flexible in negotiation.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob and move on."
