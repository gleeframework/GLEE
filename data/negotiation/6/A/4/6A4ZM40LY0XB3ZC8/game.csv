,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $105. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $112. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but I'm still hoping to find a price that's closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $108? It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close this. ",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to split the difference again, Bob. I think $112 was a fair compromise, and I'm not going to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I hope you'll consider it.",109.0,Alice,9,
