Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value, the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning  ""given its value."" 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing it publicly,  you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity to a broader market. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider a price that, while high, might be justifiable to him."
