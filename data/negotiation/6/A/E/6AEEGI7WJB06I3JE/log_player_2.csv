**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While you might be able to get the price a little lower, the difference is becoming marginal.  $1,175,000 is a good price considering your $1,500,000 maximum, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
