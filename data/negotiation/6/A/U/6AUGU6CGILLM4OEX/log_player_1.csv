Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering it for $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely given his valuation at $80). 
* **Psychology:** A price slightly below a whole number like $120 can sometimes feel more appealing to a buyer. 

**Important Note:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer given his valuation. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain before accepting the guaranteed $120 from John."
