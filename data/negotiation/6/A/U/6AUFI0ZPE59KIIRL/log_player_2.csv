"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum, it's still leaving significant room for negotiation. You should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $850,000. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's better to continue the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price of $850,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $900,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy we're finding some common ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to your desired price of $875,000.  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly better price, but it's likely that the cost of additional negotiation will outweigh the potential savings.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again, or you having to buy from John for a higher price."
