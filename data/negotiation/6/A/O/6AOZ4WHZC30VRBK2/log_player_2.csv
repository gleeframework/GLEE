# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it provides significant value at this price point, especially considering it's worth $100 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so you are hoping to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
