"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for this amazing product. It's a fair price that reflects the value it offers. Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've been able to locate an alternative source offering the product at $13,000. I believe this aligns more closely with what I'm looking to spend. I would like to make a counteroffer of $12,500 for your product. This is the highest amount I'm comfortable paying given my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is within your range.",12500.0,Bob,4,
