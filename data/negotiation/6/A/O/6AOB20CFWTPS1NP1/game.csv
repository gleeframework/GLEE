"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm a bit of a budget buyer, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $100.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's fair for me. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  Would you be willing to consider $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet your target price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I can do $87.50, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $87.50 is getting closer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target.  To make this work, I need to be at $90.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,7,
