"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than Bob's $80 value, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is above your $120 minimum, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's open to negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm a bit of a budget buyer, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum price of $120.  Selling to John right now would guarantee my minimum. However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can potentially increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer compromises by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. 
* **Appeal to value:** I reiterate that the product offers good value, framing it as a positive for Bob.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I leave the door open for more discussion, suggesting that this could be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I still have 6 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  Would you be willing to consider $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I express a willingness to work with Bob and find a solution.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I highlight that $90 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Urgency and closure:** I subtly emphasize the need to finalize the deal. 

This counteroffer aims to:
*  Reiterate my commitment to a deal.
*  Present a compromise that doesn't drastically reduce my potential earnings.
*  Keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet your target price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I can do $87.50, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have 4 rounds left to reach my goal, and I believe I can still push for a higher offer. It's a risk, but with John as a backup, I can afford to be a bit more demanding."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $87.50 is getting closer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target.  To make this work, I need to be at $90.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterate my target:** I'm sticking to $90, emphasizing that it's my target. 
* **Fair compromise:** I emphasize that $90 is a fair compromise, highlighting that we're both making concessions.
* **Closing the deal:** I suggest that accepting $90 allows us to finally reach a deal.

This counteroffer aims to:
* **Maintain my position:** I'm not budging on my price, but I'm also not making a drastic counter-offer that could risk ending the negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's sense of fairness:** I'm emphasizing compromise and a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** I'm implying that reaching an agreement now is the best way forward."
