Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  This also leaves room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while also ensuring I get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $8,000.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher offer. I'm willing to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
