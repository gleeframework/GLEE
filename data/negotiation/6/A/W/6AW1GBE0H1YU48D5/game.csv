"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to work towards a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still allows you a substantial profit, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is still below your initial asking price, but it's a step closer to my maximum budget. I hope this can help us reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal. While $1,400,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. To move things forward, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. I appreciate your effort in coming down to $1,550,000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $1,450,000. This would allow us to close the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
