"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This is a fair price that allows for a win-win situation. Let me know if this works for you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
