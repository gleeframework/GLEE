Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This is a fair price that allows for a win-win situation. Let me know if this works for you.

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, it's clear she's unlikely to go below $8,000.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, so there's no point in further negotiation."
