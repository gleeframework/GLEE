This offer aims to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation, but also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go below $8,000, as that's my minimum.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap further."
