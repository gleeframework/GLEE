Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, while still leaving some room for negotiation with Bob. If he rejects the offer, we can further negotiate to find a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is still a good deal for me. It's a $1,500 profit, which is better than selling to John for $8,000."
