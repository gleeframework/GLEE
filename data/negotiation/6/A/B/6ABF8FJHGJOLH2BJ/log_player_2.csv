"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $120. Considering its high worth to you, this might be an excellent opportunity to invest in something that could greatly benefit you. Would you like to proceed with the purchase at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. By rejecting, you keep the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller."
