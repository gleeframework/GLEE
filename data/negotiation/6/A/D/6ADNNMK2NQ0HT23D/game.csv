"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
