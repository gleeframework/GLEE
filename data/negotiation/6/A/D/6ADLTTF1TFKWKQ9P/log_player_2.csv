"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. He's not going all the way down to his maximum value, hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob wants to save as much as possible and feels there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for further counteroffers and potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his desire to save as much as possible while also showing he's willing to compromise.  Offering $13,000 keeps the negotiation moving forward without jeopardizing his goal of a price under $13,500."
