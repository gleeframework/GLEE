"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Offer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, highlighting the product's value to him while emphasizing the need for a fair price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $825,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Aggressive:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to Alice's minimum price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Argument:** Bob frames the offer as fair for both parties, emphasizing the win-win aspect. 
* **Direct Request:**  The message directly asks for Alice's response, pushing the negotiation forward."
