"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
