"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to us, I'm extending this opportunity for you to purchase it at $120. This is a special offer tailored just for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, my budget is limited to $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your needs, I am willing to consider your offer of $100. However, due to the high demand for our product, I need to ensure that I can still provide quality service to all our customers. Therefore, I propose a final offer of $110 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still not ideal. Bob is determined to save as much as possible and knows he can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate further or potentially secure a better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $105.  If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to stay within your budget, Bob. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to accept $105 for the product. This aligns closely with your offer and allows us to move forward with the transaction. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally agreed to a price of $105, which is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Accepting this offer is the best course of action, as it secures the product while still saving Bob $5 compared to buying from John."
