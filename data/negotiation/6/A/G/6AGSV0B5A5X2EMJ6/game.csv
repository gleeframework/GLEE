,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $82 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you at $78, which is still a bit higher than your offer but closer to my original price. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",78.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $78 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $76 for the product. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",76.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $77, which is just a dollar more than your offer. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",77.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to a deal, but I'd like to try to shave off a bit more from the price. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. I think this is a fair price that's closer to my budget.",75.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're really close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $76, which is just a dollar more than your offer. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's make a deal!",76.0,Alice,9,
