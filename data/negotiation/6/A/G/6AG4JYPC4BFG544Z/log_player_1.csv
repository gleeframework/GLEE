Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
