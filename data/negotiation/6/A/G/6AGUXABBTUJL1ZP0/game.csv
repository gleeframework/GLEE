"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to sell it. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This allows you to stay within your budget while also giving me a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $9,000 might be a bit high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $8,500? This would allow me to stay within my financial constraints while acknowledging the value of the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
