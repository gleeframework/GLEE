Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500. I will counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
