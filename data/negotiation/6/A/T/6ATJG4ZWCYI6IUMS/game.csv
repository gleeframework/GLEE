"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me, but I do see the value in the product. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the reply. I'm still very interested but $1,800,000 is outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere,  $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant compromise on my end. To be candid, I have another interested buyer, but I value our conversation and believe we can make this work. Would you consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a firm budget for this purchase. I can go up to $1,450,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
