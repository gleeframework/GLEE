Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant compromise on my end. To be candid, I have another interested buyer, but I value our conversation and believe we can make this work. Would you consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.
