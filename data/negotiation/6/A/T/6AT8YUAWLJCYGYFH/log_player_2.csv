{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range considering my budget. This allows for potential negotiation and hopefully brings us closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred range. I'd like to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target. I'm willing to consider buying from John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, so I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Hopefully, we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price again, it's still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to push for a lower price, especially since John is offering the product for a significantly lower price.  Negotiating with Alice is still worth it since I'm close to my ideal price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This price is still within my budget and hopefully, close enough to Alice's offer that we can reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my ideal price range, but it's still $80,000 above my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will keep lowering her price slowly, and I might end up paying more than I would from John. At this point, it's more efficient and reliable to purchase the product from John, securing a deal within my budget."
