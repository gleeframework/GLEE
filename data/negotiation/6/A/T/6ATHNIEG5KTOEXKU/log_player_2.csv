"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's talk about the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 2

# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.

Alice is willing to come down from her original offer, but $1,075,000 is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  We've only had 3 rounds so far, and I have more time to try to reach a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm confident the product is valuable, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,025,000.  It's a significant step closer to where we both need to be."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 9th round, and Alice has come down to $1,052,500.  While I would prefer to get it lower, this is very close to my desired price range and it would be a good deal.  I only have one more round to make a deal with Alice before I have to buy from John at a higher price. It's time to close this deal!"
