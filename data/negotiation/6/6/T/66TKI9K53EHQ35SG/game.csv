"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is  considerably higher than your proposed price. I could consider letting it go for $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This reflects the value of the product to me while allowing for a fair profit for you.  Let's close this deal!",1450000.0,Bob,4,
