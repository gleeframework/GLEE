"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the value Alice places on the product. Rejecting and providing a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially purchase the product for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 seems a little steep for me. Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer aims to establish a significantly lower price point right from the start.  It's common negotiation tactic to open with a lower offer than your target price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $75 allows ample room for negotiation between your offer and Alice's initial asking price.
* **Polite and Respectful:** The message maintains a courteous and professional tone, which is important for a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $120 is still above both your target price and the product's value to Alice. There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting and countering, you signal your willingness to walk away and encourage Alice to consider a price closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However,  $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Alice's price, but it stays below your $100 limit.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  By proposing $90, you're gauging how much Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You're still keeping John's offer of $100 as a backup plan."
