Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $15,000 is significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also reinforces the product's value in Bob's mind.
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to start a conversation rather than be a simple take-it-or-leave-it offer. This allows for flexibility and potential negotiation."
