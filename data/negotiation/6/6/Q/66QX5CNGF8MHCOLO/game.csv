"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is your maximum, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $120 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you do $95?  That's a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we try $110? It's a bit above your offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I can't go any higher than $100.  That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $130? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,7,
