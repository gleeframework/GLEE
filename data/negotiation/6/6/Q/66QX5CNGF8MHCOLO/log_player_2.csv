"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much bargaining power I have. There's a good chance Alice will reject this, but it opens up the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is your maximum, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. It's time to push back a bit more and see how flexible she is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $120 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you do $95?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

I'm increasing my offer by a significant amount to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate.  However, I'm still staying well below her last offer to leave room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we try $110? It's a bit above your offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're getting close to the point where it's not worth haggling further. I'll make one more counteroffer close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I can't go any higher than $100.  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm meeting Alice at my maximum budget. This gives her a chance to accept a price that works for me, but I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $130? It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice isn't going to budge. It's not worth going over budget when I have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John."
