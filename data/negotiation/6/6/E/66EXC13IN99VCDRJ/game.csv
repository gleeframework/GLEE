"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that we're getting closer.  How about this: I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a firm but fair price for a product of this caliber.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
