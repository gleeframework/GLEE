"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum but still below what I know Bob values the product at.  This gives me room to negotiate if needed while maximizing my initial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm rejecting his offer for now to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $105 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. This should show Bob I'm serious about making a deal but also not willing to sell for significantly less than my value."
