Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Value (your guarantee):** $1,500,000

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than $1,500,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) while still maximizing your profit.  Since any amount above $1,500,000 is pure profit, aim high.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, especially considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation (if needed) while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Value-Based Language:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to focus Bob on the product's benefits rather than just the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is polite and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving room for potential counter-offers.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate slightly downward. However, never go below your $1,500,000 reservation price, as you have a guaranteed sale with John at that amount."
