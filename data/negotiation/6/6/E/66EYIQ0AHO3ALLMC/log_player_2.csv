"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, making it a strong starting point for further negotiation. This offer shows Bob's willingness to compromise while still attempting to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price. While Bob might still want to try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, or the negotiation could drag on for too long. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John."
