"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of significant value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the value it brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer ensures you're still getting a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, we're still not quite there yet. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I need to see a price that acknowledges the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. I believe this offer is fair and reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
