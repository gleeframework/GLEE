"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

This offer is above your maximum price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for negotiation, and  we can adjust it based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a savvy buyer, Bob! I can do a bit better than $80, but I need to make a profit. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can negotiate a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her current offer and our previous offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go. Is that a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $92 is a reasonable price, saving us $8 compared to John's offer."
