"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit further to show flexibility, but still holding firm above my minimum.  I hope this encourages Bob to come up a little more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to stick with my goal of getting at least $10,000. There are still several rounds left, and I think I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject the offer. While $9,750 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping I can get a slightly better deal in the next few rounds. If not, I'm comfortable selling to John for $12,000."
