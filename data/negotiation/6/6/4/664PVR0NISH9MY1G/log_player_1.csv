Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $500000, considering it's a one-time purchase and I'm not sure of the full value to me yet. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $750000. That's a good step.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Could we meet in the middle at $625000?  I think that would be a fair price that respects both of our positions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
