"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $500000, considering it's a one-time purchase and I'm not sure of the full value to me yet. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $750000. That's a good step.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Could we meet in the middle at $625000?  I think that would be a fair price that respects both of our positions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $625000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $700000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",700000.0,Alice,5,
