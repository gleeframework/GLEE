"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, it's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showcasing Bob's serious intention to purchase but also his commitment to staying within his budget.  By making a substantial counteroffer, Bob is hoping to initiate a back-and-forth negotiation that may lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  While $9,000 is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a good compromise and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer balances saving money with the risk of a longer negotiation that might not yield a significantly lower price."
