"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $1800000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional perks you're offering, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer, so how about $1700000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1700000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet at $1750000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've already made a significant compromise by considering $1750000. I'm afraid I can only go up to $1600000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",1600000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a significant compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $1600000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet at $1650000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1650000.0,Alice,7,
