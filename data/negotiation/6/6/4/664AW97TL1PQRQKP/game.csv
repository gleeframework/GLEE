"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin and is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
