Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you a strong position. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.
* **Simple and Direct:** The message is clear and to the point, focusing on the value proposition for Bob."
