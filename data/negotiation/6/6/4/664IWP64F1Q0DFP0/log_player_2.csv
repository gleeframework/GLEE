"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. It comes with advanced features and unparalleled performance. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $900000 for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that he's serious about saving money and willing to negotiate. 
* **Justified Counteroffer:** The message provides a reason for the lower offer, referencing Bob's budget and market value comparisons. This makes the offer seem more legitimate and less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Bob's message leaves room for further discussion and doesn't completely close the door on a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your consideration of our product. In light of your offer, I would like to present a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value of the product and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While accepting the offer, Bob could still try to negotiate a slight reduction (e.g., $840,000) in a future round. This would be a good strategy if Alice is willing to compromise further. However, there is a risk that Alice will not be willing to go lower and Bob might lose the deal.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget. It reduces the risk of losing the deal entirely by further negotiation."
