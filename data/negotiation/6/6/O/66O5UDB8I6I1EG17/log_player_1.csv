Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  This sets the tone for the negotiation and signals to Bob that I value the product highly. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer is not so high that it immediately discourages Bob from negotiating. 
* **Plan B:** I have a backup option with John, which provides me with leverage and a way to walk away if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  Therefore, accepting his offer would mean a significant loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum value:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable threshold.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Backup option:**  I have a secure backup option with John, which gives me the leverage to walk away if the negotiation doesn't meet my expectations.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer is not too far from Bob's counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I can still walk away and sell to John for a higher price if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer.  Depending on his reaction, I'll either accept, make a new counteroffer, or move on to my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum value:** My goal is to maximize profit, and Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable threshold.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Backup option:** I have a secure backup option with John, which gives me the leverage to walk away if the negotiation doesn't meet my expectations.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I will likely offer a price closer to $1,000,000, as it's a reasonable compromise and leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my desired minimum value.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer is close to Bob's counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation and potentially reaching a deal.
* **Plan B:** I can still walk away and sell to John for a higher price if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. Depending on his reaction, I'll either accept, make a new counteroffer, or move on to my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my desired value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that meets my expectations.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum value:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable threshold.
* **Negotiation stalemate:**  The negotiation seems to be stuck, with only small increments in price. It's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **Backup option:** I have a secure backup option with John, who is willing to pay my desired price of $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob's offer is not meeting my minimum requirements, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I reach my desired profit and avoids further potentially unproductive negotiation with Bob."
