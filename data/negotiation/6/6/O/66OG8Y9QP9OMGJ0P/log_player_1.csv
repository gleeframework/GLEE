Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product, considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is reasonable and exceeds my minimum. It's better to secure a deal now than risk further negotiations."
