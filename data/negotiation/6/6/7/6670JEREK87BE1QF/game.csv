"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $1,150,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're serious about acquiring the product, let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
