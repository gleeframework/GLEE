"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $1,150,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're serious about acquiring the product, let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. This is a good deal for Bob, as he can acquire the product without exceeding his limit.  There's no point in rejecting the offer and risking a counteroffer that could push the price higher. Additionally, buying from John at the same price would be a waste of negotiating time."
