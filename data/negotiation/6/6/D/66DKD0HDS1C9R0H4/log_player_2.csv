"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than my initial assessment.  Considering its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable value ($800,000) and lower than your maximum acceptable value ($1,000,000).** This indicates potential for negotiation.
* **There's room to save money.** By rejecting, you open the door for a counteroffer and a potential better deal. 
* **Buying from John immediately would be the worst outcome.**  While it's a guarantee, it's the most expensive option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I've invested significant time and resources into this product, and I'm confident in its value exceeding your current offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price ($850,000).** While it's closer to my target, I want to try to get a lower price.
* **There's still room to negotiate.**  Both of us have moved closer to the middle ground. 
* **Buying from John immediately would be too costly.** I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
