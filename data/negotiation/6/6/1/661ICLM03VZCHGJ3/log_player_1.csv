Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap through negotiation tactics or finding additional value propositions.

**Offer Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current product valuation, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor with Room for Negotiation:** Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to anchor the negotiation in your favor. This leaves space for you to make concessions and still potentially land above your minimum.

2. **Direct Sale to John:**  Knowing Bob's valuation and your guaranteed offer, it might be more efficient to proceed directly with John. 

**Example Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,800,000 starting point is significantly above Bob's valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling your willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Rejection:** Be prepared for Bob to reject your initial offer. Have a counter-offer strategy ready, potentially highlighting additional benefits or value propositions of the product that might appeal to him.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you're confident in John's offer and time is a factor, going directly to him might be the most efficient choice.

**Ultimately, the best offer depends on your negotiation style, risk tolerance, and how much you prioritize a potential deal with Bob over a guaranteed sale to John.**"
