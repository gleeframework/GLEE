**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I want to try to negotiate a lower price. It's too early to buy from John, as I haven't explored Alice's willingness to negotiate yet."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need at least $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
