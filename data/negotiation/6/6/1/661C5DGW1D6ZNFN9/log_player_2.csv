"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice further. You can offer a lower price and potentially save more than just the $15 difference between Alice's offer and John's price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
It's better to accept Alice's offer. Although you can still negotiate, the chance of Alice dropping the price further is low. Buying from Alice for $90 is still better than buying from John for $80."
