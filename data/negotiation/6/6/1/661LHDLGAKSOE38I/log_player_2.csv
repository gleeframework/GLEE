"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, I'm hoping to get a better price. Would you be willing to accept $10,000 for it?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while $12,500 is not the best possible price, it's still a good deal for Bob.  He's already saved a significant amount compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a potential stalemate or having to buy from John at a higher price."
