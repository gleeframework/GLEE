"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price.  Since John is offering the same price, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your price limit."
