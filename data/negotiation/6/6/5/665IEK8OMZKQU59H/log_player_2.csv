"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Rejecting Alice's offer makes sense here. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is better than Alice's $9,000 price."
