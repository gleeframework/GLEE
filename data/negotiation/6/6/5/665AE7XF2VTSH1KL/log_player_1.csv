"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $1,200,000 right away. This leaves space for Bob to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob, building a foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still within the range of a profitable deal for me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I don't need to rush into accepting a lower offer.
* **Exploring counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,125,000?  This would still give you a significant saving compared to your perceived value, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value and the benefits Bob will gain from acquiring it.
* **Seeking a win-win:**  My message focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us, creating a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1120000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  Bob's offer is only $5,000 less than my previous counteroffer and very close to my target price.  Accepting it would result in a significant profit.
* **Risk of further negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions and potentially a lower price.
* **Time is ticking:**  We are only in round 4, and I have 6 more rounds to potentially get a better offer, but it's not guaranteed.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a very profitable deal with minimal risk of getting a lower price later on."
