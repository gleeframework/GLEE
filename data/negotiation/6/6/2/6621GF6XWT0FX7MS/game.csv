,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate but that's a fair starting point.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $17,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,6,
