"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth and potential for your business.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks again for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but  $1,025,000 is still quite a bit below where I see the value. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this. My final offer is $1,050,000.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
