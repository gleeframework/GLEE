,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $18000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $19000, which is a fair compromise considering the value and quality of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $19000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $18500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18500.0,Bob,4,
