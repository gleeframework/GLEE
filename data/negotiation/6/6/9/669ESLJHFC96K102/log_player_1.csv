Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a competitive price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth a shot.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price high.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:**  I know Bob values the product at $12,000, so aiming significantly higher might deter him.  A price closer to his valuation, but still highly profitable for me, makes sense. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have the safety net of John who will buy the product at my desired minimum, so I can confidently start with a higher offer to Bob."
