Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with an ambitious price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  I believe $1,600,000 is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but I can't risk losing the sale and getting the same price from John. It's time to close the deal."
