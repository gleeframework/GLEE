{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. My initial price is $1,300,000.  Let's talk about how we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's continue this conversation and find a solution that works for both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,000,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value proposition for you. Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking for a price closer to my limit. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a sure thing and a much better outcome than potentially settling for a lower price with Bob."
