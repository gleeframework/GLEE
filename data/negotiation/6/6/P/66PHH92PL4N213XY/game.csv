"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1000000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
