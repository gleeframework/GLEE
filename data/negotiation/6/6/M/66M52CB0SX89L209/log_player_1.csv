Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed offer from John, your goal is to get the highest price. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price encourages Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a high price that still leaves you with a significant profit margin. It also acknowledges that the product is worth a considerable amount to Bob."
