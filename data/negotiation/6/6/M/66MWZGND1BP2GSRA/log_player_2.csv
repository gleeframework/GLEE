"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price. I'll try a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to understand her lower acceptable price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but $82 is still too high. I'll reject and propose a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Could you do $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

I'm nudging the price closer to my goal while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. This approach aims to find a mutually acceptable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $79? It's a great price, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and $79 is a reasonable price, saving me $21 from John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
