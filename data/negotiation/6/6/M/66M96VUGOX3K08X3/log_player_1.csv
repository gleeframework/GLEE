"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for potential concessions. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much negotiating power I might have. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. I'm not pressured to accept any offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Early Stage:** It's too early in the negotiation to accept an offer $200,000 below my initial ask.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting, I signal to Bob that I'm seeking a better deal and am willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is moving in the right direction,  I'm targeting a price closer to $1,400,000.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find that reflected in my proposal. "", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've lowered my price by $100,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** My counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's, but it's within a range that encourages further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I've reiterated the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth beyond just a price tag."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a $300,000 profit, which is a substantial gain.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've both made concessions, and this price feels like a fair compromise.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more from Bob, the longer the negotiation continues, the greater the risk of the deal falling through. It's better to secure a good deal now."
