"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob likely doesn't know the true value of the product. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the rarity and value of the product to pique Bob's interest.

**Strategy:**

* I'll monitor Bob's reaction and adjust my offers based on his responses. 
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and make a decision based on its value.
* I'll always keep John's $1,500,000 offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $1800000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $1,800,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price from Bob.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 would guarantee a sale, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a price closer to my initial offer.
* I will carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to adjust my strategy accordingly.
