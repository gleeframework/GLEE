"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob is truly interested and the product is worth more to him, I have room to negotiate downwards.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he immediately rejects, it tells me he likely doesn't value it as high as I do.

This strategy balances risk and reward. I'm willing to take a chance on a high offer in the hopes of getting a great deal, but I also have the safety net of selling to John for $1,200,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.  However, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  

* **Reasoning:** Bob rejected my initial offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.  This suggests he might be willing to go higher.  I want to see if he's truly serious about buying the product.
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll be able to gauge his willingness to pay more based on his response to my counteroffer.

**Note:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still a viable option, but I'm going to try and squeeze out a bit more from Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $1,300,000 with a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise:

* **Reasoning:** I want to show I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically. This counteroffer reflects that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Strategy:**  This gives Bob a chance to accept a price closer to my initial offer, while still giving me a profit that's worth it. If he rejects, it indicates that he might be unwilling to meet me halfway, and I'll have to reassess my strategy. 

It's important to maintain a balance of firmness and flexibility to secure the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is only $50,000 below my initial offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, I need to weigh the risks:

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I could end up with a lower price or even lose the deal entirely.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John for $1,200,000. This is only a $150,000 gain over my minimum value.

**Conclusion:**  

Accepting Bob's offer gives me a good profit and ensures a sale. The risk of continuing to negotiate seems higher than the potential reward."
