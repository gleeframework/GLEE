"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a decent price considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  Accepting this offer would save Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John. While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
