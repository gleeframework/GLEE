"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and will greatly benefit your business. As the product is worth $1000000 to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this incredible product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider my offer and see if we can meet in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $725000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. Can you consider this offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to make concessions. However, $700000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $675000. Can you consider this offer and see if we can finalize the deal?",675000.0,Bob,6,
