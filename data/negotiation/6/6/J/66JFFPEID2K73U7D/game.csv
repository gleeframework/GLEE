"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've already priced the product competitively. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'd like to pay. How about $105? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a compromise.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I can do $107.50. That's as close to $105 as I can get.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $106? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,6,
