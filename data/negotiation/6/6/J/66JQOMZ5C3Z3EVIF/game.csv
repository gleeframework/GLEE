"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  Unfortunately, $145 is still a bit higher than I'm able to spend. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to pay $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $138? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $138 is still a bit too high. Let's try $135. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it fair.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $137. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done. What do you think?",137.0,Alice,7,
