"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You have 10 rounds, so there's ample time to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** A counteroffer allows you to set the terms and potentially push Alice closer to your desired price point."
