Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially landing you a slightly higher profit.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a sense of urgency, potentially swaying Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. You have a strong backup option with John, ensuring you won't lose out on the minimum value you place on the product."
