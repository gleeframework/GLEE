{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can potentially still negotiate a lower price and save some money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $1,050,000 is her final offer.  Since this is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's best to go ahead and purchase the product from John for that price.  You'll save yourself the potential for further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget."
