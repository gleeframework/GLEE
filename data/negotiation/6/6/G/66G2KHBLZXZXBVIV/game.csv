"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I see we're getting closer! $8500 is definitely closer, but I'm still needing to make a little more on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
