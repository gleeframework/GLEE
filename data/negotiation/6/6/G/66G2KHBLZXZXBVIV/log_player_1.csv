"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there is potential for you to earn more.
* **It's a fair starting point:** $10,000 is a reasonable price for both parties, considering the value difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  Since you have multiple rounds, rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counter-offer:**  You can make a counter-offer that's closer to your initial offer of $10,000.
* **See if Bob is willing to budge:** By rejecting his offer, you gauge his level of interest and see if he's willing to raise his offer. 
* **Negotiate:**  You can use the remaining rounds to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but also that you believe your product is worth more than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for the counteroffer (value of the product) to make it more persuasive. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  You use language like ""What do you think?"" to signal that you're open to further discussion and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $9000. I can do $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a little higher. 

* **Negotiation:** You have multiple rounds left, and rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going.
* **Possible counteroffer:** You can counter with a price slightly higher than $8,500, increasing your potential earnings.
* **Testing the waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can gauge how willing he is to meet your demands."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer! $8,500 is definitely closer, but I'm still needing to make a little more on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Justification:** You justify the price by saying it's ""fair for both of us."" This helps to make your counteroffer more appealing.
* **Positive reinforcement:** You remind Bob that you're confident he'll be happy with the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to being happy with the price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8250. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,250 is getting closer to your minimum, you're still within range of your desired price and have several rounds remaining. 

* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still potential to negotiate a higher price, perhaps closer to your previous counteroffer of $8,750. 
* **Gauge Bob's willingness:**  By rejecting this offer, you can gauge Bob's true limit and see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  It's better to keep the negotiation going to see if you can get a better deal. Selling to John right now would guarantee $8,000, but you might be able to do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** The message uses the phrase ""final compromise"" to suggest that this is the last offer you'll make.
* **Justification:** You reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's finalize this deal"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to push Bob to accept by creating the impression that this is your last offer. It also uses the last remaining rounds to your advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $8500. I can do $8250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,250 is still a bit lower than what you hoped for, it's important to consider the following:

* **Limited rounds:** This is Round 8, meaning you only have two rounds left.
* **John's offer:** You can sell to John for $8,000 at any moment, so $8,250 is a slight improvement.
* **Bob's stance:** Bob has made it clear that he's unlikely to go higher. 

It's a risk, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a small profit above John's offer.  There's a chance you might get a better deal in the next round, but it's not guaranteed, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is higher."
