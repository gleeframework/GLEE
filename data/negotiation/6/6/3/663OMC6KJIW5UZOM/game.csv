"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about $110? I'm willing to meet you halfway, and this price is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
