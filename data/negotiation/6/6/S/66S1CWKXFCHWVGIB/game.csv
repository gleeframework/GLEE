"Hello Bob, I'm excited to tell you about the product I'm selling. It's incredibly valuable and I believe it would be a huge asset to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. I could be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,220,000? ",1220000.0,Bob,4,
