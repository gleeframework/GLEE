Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $135 represents a 12.5% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This isn't an outrageous increase and might be appealing to Bob if he values the product.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $135. You'll need to be prepared to potentially negotiate or accept the guaranteed $120 from John if Bob rejects the offer."
