Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price like $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product if it's valuable to him.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to negotiate from a position of strength.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a degree of risk. Bob could reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth considering."
