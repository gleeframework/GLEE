"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,350,000? This is a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product, and it's also a fair price for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $1,325,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
