"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $95 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring a good profit if he accepts immediately.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $80, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below my minimum ($80) and even further from his known valuation of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a large gap between our positions, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:**  I have John as a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a more reasonable offer and encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. Could you do $87?"", ""product_price"": 87}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer ($95) and Bob's counteroffer ($70), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** The $87 counteroffer keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price ($80) and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially secure a profitable deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a bit below what you were hoping for. How about we split the difference and do $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $78 is still slightly below my absolute minimum of $80. While it's closer, I'm not in a position where I need to accept a loss.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm firm on my valuation and putting a bit of pressure on Bob. He knows my initial offer was much higher. 
* **John as Backup:**  The option to sell to John for $80 gives me leverage. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he's not going to meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $82? That's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by coming down to $82, but it's a strategic move. This shows Bob I'm flexible but also signals that I'm getting close to my limit. 
* **Above Minimum, Encouraging Agreement:**  The $82 price point keeps me above my absolute minimum while being very tempting for Bob, who knows the product is worth $100 to him. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we're nearing the halfway point in the rounds, I want to encourage Bob to agree sooner rather than later."
