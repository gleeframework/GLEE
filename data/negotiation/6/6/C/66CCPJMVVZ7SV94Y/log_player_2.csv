"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in the product and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.
* This offer represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal entirely if Alice decides to walk away. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
