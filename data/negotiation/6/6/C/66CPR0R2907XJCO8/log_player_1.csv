"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a great product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,250 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price. There's still a good chance I can get a better deal from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to drop to $8,400, which is a small compromise on my end.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, we're getting closer to the end of the rounds.  John is offering me my minimum price, and it's more important to secure my minimum value than to risk getting less from Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
