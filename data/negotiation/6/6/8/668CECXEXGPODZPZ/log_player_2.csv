# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and attempt to lower the price further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,750, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,900. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the best possible deal.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price."
