Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  There are only 6 rounds left, and I don't think I can get a better price from Bob.  It's better to sell to John now and guarantee the minimum value."
