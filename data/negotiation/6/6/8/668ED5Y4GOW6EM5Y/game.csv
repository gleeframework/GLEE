"Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $97.50? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and we can both walk away happy.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I can go.",96.0,Bob,6,
