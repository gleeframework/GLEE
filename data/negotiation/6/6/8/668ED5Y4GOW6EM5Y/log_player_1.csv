Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $80, so $110 is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate up.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $120, but you're leaving room to negotiate.
* **It's clear and concise:** You're stating your price and inviting Bob to respond. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also below the $110 I initially offered. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit higher.  I can still sell to John for $120 if we can't come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $100 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm acknowledging his interest and offering a fair price to encourage him to accept.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the fairness of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I know I can get $120 from John if I need to.  I'll counteroffer one more time, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $97.50? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 97.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer before selling to John.  
* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($95). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and that this price is a good deal for both of us.

Let's see if Bob finally accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $96 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation any further, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum price. 

I'll sell the product to John to ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
