"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $125? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $95. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $95. How about we try $110? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $110 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $100. This is my final offer, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",115.0,Alice,7,
