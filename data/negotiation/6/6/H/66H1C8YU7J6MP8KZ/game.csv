"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $890,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this price. I'm willing to go to $880,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer is $880,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $885,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,7,
