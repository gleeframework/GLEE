Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $95 is more than your minimum of $80, meaning you'd still make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $95 is less than Bob's value of $100, leaving room for him to feel he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for negotiation, giving you the chance to either lower the price slightly or potentially get closer to your ideal price. 

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still some room for negotiation to get closer to your ideal price. You can likely get a higher offer by rejecting and sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $87 is only slightly higher than selling to John, it's still a better deal for you. It's likely that Bob is unwilling to go higher, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale at a decent price."
