"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. It's something I value at $10,000 but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get something you value at $15,000 for a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. While you could reject her offer and buy from John, you would end up spending more. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,500."
