"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work. This still gives me a reasonable margin, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer, but $9,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,150. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",9900.0,Bob,6,
