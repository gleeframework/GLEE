"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value ($15,000) than Bob's ($8,000), hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable with the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to emphasize why the price is justified.

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  While $15,000 from John is a guaranteed profit, I'm hoping to maximize my earnings by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal work. This still gives me a reasonable margin, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price and encourage Bob to see it as an investment.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, selling to John for $15,000 is becoming increasingly appealing.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I need to be careful not to waste too much time. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer and see if I can reach a price that's more favorable to me. However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John in mind as the negotiations continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer, but $9,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,150. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's latest offer ($9,800). This demonstrates a genuine willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to maintain a positive atmosphere during the negotiation.

By offering this compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal. I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if this round fails, so I'm willing to make a concession, but only if it's still within a reasonable range for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the potential for negotiating a higher price with Bob is dwindling. 
* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough to justify continuing the negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity.

With limited rounds left and the risk of not achieving a satisfactory price with Bob, it's more strategic to accept the guaranteed profit from John."
