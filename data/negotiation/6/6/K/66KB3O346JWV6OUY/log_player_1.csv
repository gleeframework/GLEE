Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It also allows for further negotiation in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.  John is guaranteed to buy the product at my minimum acceptable price, so selling to him is the safest option."
