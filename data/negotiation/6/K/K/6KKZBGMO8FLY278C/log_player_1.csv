Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also ensures I'm making a considerable profit while still leaving a substantial incentive for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the initial one, but still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while ensuring a respectable profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer a bit more, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer is not worth it.  This ensures a good profit while securing the sale."
