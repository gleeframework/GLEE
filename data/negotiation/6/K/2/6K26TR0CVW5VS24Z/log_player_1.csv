"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price, it's still within a reasonable range.  Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to counter and potentially get closer to my target price.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe bet, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially achieve a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $750,000 is too low for you, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price of $800,000, it's still slightly below.  I'm willing to risk another round to potentially push him higher.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this transaction. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum desired price and aligns with the value of the product to him. Accepting this offer ensures I secure the deal while meeting my financial goals. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might reject future counteroffers, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely.  Furthermore, selling to John for the same price would be a wasted opportunity to potentially secure a higher price with Bob."
