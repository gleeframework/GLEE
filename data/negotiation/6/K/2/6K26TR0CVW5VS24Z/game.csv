"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's discuss further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is too low for you, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this compromise?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this transaction. Let's make it happen!",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
