"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
