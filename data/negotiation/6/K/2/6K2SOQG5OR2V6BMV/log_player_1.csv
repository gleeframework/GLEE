"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to establish a strong starting point and gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects this offer, we can then adjust accordingly based on his counteroffer and his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially since I still have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.  I believe this offer is reasonable and might be enough to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $925,000.  While I was hoping for more, this is still a good deal and I'm worried that if I reject it, the negotiations could go on longer, potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or a sale to John at a lower price. It's important to be realistic about the potential risks and maximize my earnings."
