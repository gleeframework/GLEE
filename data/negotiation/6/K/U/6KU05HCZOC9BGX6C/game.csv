"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950000.

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.  Your offer of $920000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference?
