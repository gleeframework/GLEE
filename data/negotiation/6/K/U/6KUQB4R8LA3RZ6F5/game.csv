I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you try to meet me at $105? That would be a great compromise for me.,105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your hesitation, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but let's meet at $110. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
