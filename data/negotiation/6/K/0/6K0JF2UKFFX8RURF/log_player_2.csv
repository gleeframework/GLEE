"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$50 is a great price**, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. 
* **Rejecting and counteroffering** allows you to potentially get an even better deal.
* **Buying from John** is a safety net, but you want to try to get a better price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$40 is a reasonable counteroffer:** It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still potentially a good deal for both of us.
* **This counteroffer is aggressive but not unreasonable:** It shows that you're serious about getting a good price, but it's not so low that it would likely be rejected outright.
* **It gives Alice room to negotiate:** If she's willing to come down a bit more, she can still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$45 is a good price:** It's lower than Alice's initial offer and within my budget.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation:** I could try to get a lower price, but there's a chance Alice will reject any further counteroffers.
* **Time is valuable:** It's better to secure a good price now than risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
