Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,600,000 represents a premium price for a premium product, I understand your initial offer might not reflect the full value you see. To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your increased offer.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I need to see that reflected in the final price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still beyond my budget. While I'd prefer to get the product from Alice if the price was right, I'm going to go with John's offer. I'm happy to save $400,000, even if it means getting the product from a different seller."
