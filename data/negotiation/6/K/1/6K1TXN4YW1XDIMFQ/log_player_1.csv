Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the potential value to Bob, encouraging him to see the offer as beneficial.

**Strategy:**

* **Potential Counteroffer:** I anticipate Bob might counter-offer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll be mindful of my minimum value.
* **John as Backup:** I'll use John's offer as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I'd like to earn. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as Safety Net:** While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I can get from John.  Having John's offer as a backup provides me with a more comfortable position during negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I will counter-offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Flexibility:** I'll remain flexible and adjust my counter-offer based on Bob's response. 
* **Maintain John's Offer:** I will keep John's offer in mind, ensuring I don't negotiate myself into a situation where I'm worse off than selling to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $11,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about $11,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it brings us closer to a deal.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer ($11,500) is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my counter-offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to agree. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further.
* **John as Backup:**  John's offer continues to provide a safety net, giving me confidence to be firm with my counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly bring the price down to $11000? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is refusing to budge from his $11,000 offer. This is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to earn.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering a significantly higher price, and I have no guarantee that I can reach a better deal with Bob.
* **Risk Assessment:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Loss:** While I would prefer to earn more, accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiations.
* **Time is Valuable:** The negotiation process is consuming time and resources.  Selling to John provides a quicker and more predictable outcome.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate with no clear path to agreement."
