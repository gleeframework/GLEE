"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and I believe the product's value to you is higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, but my final offer is $16,000. If you're not willing to go lower than that, I'll have to consider buying from John.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I need to make a bit more. I'll do $16,200, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options",16200.0,Alice,5,
