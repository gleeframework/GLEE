Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is still too low for me, and I have plenty of time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob is getting closer, $1,080,000 is still significantly below what I need. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but he's still too far off for my liking. With only 4 rounds left, it's a risky gamble to keep negotiating.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself a comfortable profit."
