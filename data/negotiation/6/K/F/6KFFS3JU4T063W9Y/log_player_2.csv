"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $200 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to do $150? "", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob still wants to pay as little as possible. Even though $175 is lower than Alice's first offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 160}
