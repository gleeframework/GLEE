Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $95. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, considering its worth to you is $80. I look forward to your positive response.

Alice's offer is too high. While she tries to flatter you and claims the product is worth $80 to you, you know your budget and John offers a better deal."
