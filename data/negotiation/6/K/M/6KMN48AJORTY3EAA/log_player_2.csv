The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90. I can do better. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? I think it's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is still a good deal for me. I'm willing to accept this offer to save money compared to buying from John."
