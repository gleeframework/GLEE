"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway, and I'm also setting a foundation for future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  While $9,500 is better than his initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  There's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By proposing $10,250, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to my initial offer of $10,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my target of $12,000, it's important to consider that:

1. **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and each round brings us closer to the potential sale to John.
2. **Value to Bob:**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's higher than his initial value of $8,000.

Accepting this offer secures a sale and keeps the negotiations moving forward. There's always the chance that I might get a better offer later, but I don't want to risk losing out to John."
