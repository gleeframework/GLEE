"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
