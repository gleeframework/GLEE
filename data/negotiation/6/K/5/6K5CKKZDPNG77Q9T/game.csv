"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to  $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $975,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
