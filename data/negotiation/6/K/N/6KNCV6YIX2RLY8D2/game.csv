"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
