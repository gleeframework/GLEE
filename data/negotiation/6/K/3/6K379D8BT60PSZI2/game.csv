"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my limits. How about we meet at $10,200? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers.",10200.0,Bob,4,
