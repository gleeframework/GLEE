{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates a negotiation space.
* **Reasonable Offer:** This is a reasonable offer that allows for negotiation, and Bob might be willing to accept, especially if he believes there is a good deal to be had.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping my alternative option (selling to John for $15,000) in mind, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not willing to sell for a price that significantly undervalues my product, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's still below my minimum but significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my leverage.
* **Middle ground:** The proposed price is a compromise that reflects a possible middle ground.
* **Reasoning with Bob:** I'm addressing his concerns about budget while highlighting the value of the product.
* **Alternative still available:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options, which strengthens my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my limits. How about we meet at $10,200? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $10,200 is still below my minimum of $15,000, but it's getting closer. 
* **Potential for higher counter-offers:** While I could reject and try for a higher price, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort, and I'm not guaranteed a better outcome.
* **Risk-reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, while continuing risks losing the deal entirely."
