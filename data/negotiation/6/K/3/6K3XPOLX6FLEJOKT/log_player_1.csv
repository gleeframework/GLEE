Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80.  This gives me room to negotiate while still getting a decent price.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price a bit, but I won't go below my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I want. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering the price from my initial offer, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount.  $130 is a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $110 is getting closer to my minimum, and further negotiation might not yield much more. It's time to accept and move on."
