``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $180. It's much higher than Bob's maximum budget, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is offering the maximum price he's willing to pay for the product. This is his best chance to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, so he should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. He can try a counteroffer again, or even just buy the product from John to save himself from further haggling."

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still staying well below Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to pay an unreasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that the price won't drop much lower.  Therefore, Bob should take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid further haggling."
