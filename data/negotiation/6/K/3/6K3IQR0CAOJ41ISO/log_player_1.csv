"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" qualities and ""potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high starting point acknowledges that Bob might negotiate, and it gives you space to come down while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its potential and my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you.  While his message tries to frame his offer as ""fair,"" it's clear there's room for negotiation. It's time to counter and guide the negotiation towards a more agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** Coming down by $300,000 from the initial offer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This large reduction might encourage Bob to engage more seriously.
* **Holding Above Bob's Value:** The $2,000,000 counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's stated offer while still leaving room for further negotiation. The goal is to move towards a price closer to $1,500,000 without going below that threshold.
* **Reinforcing Value:** The message reiterates the product's ""unique advantages"" to justify the still-high price and potentially nudge Bob closer to his actual perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe it's a fair price considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to your minimum price, but you're not there yet. He's now offering $1,400,000, which is only $100,000 below your guaranteed sale price with John.  There's still room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal with Bob before accepting a price so close to your backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while acknowledging the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Bob increased his offer by $200,000, so you're coming down by a smaller amount ($300,000) to show movement but hold firm on a good profit margin. 
* **Positioning as a Win-Win:**  The ""meet in the middle"" language aims to make this offer feel more agreeable to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Value:**  By highlighting your ""commitment to getting this deal done"" you imply that you have other options (which you do!), subtly increasing pressure while still valuing the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement. However, $1,700,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this price fairly represents the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now $50,000 higher than your guaranteed sale price with John. While you could try to push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer in later rounds isn't worth it. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the risk of missing out on a sale altogether."
