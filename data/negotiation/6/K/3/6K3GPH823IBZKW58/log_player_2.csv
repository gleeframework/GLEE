"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since you know the product's value to Alice is lower than her initial offer, you can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While aiming to save money, it's strategic to start with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and probes Alice's willingness to make concessions.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone, fostering a positive negotiation environment.  
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $850,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's $1,100,000, but it's still well above her perceived value of the product ($1,200,000).  This demonstrates serious interest while leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice met us halfway, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a significant markup from her $1,200,000 valuation.  There's room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. Would you consider $900,000? That would make a big difference for me."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** Moving from $850,000 to $900,000 shows willingness to compromise while still pursuing a significant discount.
* **Justification:**  By stating it ""would make a big difference,"" it hints at budget limitations without revealing a specific number, potentially making Alice more receptive.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a significant improvement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While $925,000 is slightly above our ideal target, it's a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000 offer. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Good Deal Overall:**  Securing the product for $925,000 is a solid outcome considering our initial goal of staying under $1,500,000."
