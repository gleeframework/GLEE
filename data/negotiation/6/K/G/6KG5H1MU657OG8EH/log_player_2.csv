{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above your maximum budget and only one round remains.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.** With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will come down significantly further, and you've already shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Buying from John is the most prudent option.**  You have a guaranteed deal with John, and while it's the most expensive option, it's within your budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice.

At this point,  the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice outweighs the potential savings of trying to negotiate further. It's better to secure the product now from John, guaranteeing your purchase and minimizing potential losses."
