"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,500, so how about we try $12,000 again?",12000.0,Bob,6,
