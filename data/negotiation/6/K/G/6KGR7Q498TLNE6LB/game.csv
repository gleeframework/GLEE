"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds equal value to you. To begin, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair value considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's important we both see value in this transaction. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's meet halfway on this.  ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your position. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $950,000 is still below my minimum, but to show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I truly appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
