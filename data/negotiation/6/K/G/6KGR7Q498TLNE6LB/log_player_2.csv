"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds equal value to you. To begin, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to push for a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair value considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's important we both see value in this transaction. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's meet halfway on this.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above my budget. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my maximum. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your position. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $950,000 is still below my minimum, but to show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my budget, but I still want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'm only $50,000 away from my maximum, so I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I truly appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
