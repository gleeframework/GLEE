"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 to facilitate a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. How about $1,050,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $975,000 is an improvement, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference this time.  I'll accept $1,012,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best offer I can make at this stage.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid the need for further negotiation.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",990000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're nearing the end of our negotiations. I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product, my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement and avoid the need for further haggling.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
