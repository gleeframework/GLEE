Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves me a decent profit. This should make it enticing for him to accept, but also gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would still leave you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our previous offers, hoping to find a compromise.  This shows flexibility and might make Bob more willing to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than John's offer, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm confident that I can still get a higher price by counter-offering. I'm close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm going to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my time."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering a price that is exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and might lead Bob to finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95.  While it's not ideal, it's still a decent profit for me and more than what I would get from John.  At this point, I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob, and I'd rather make a sale now than risk further negotiations."
