Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a much higher profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly implies the price is justified, even though it's considerably higher than Bob's valuation.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $800,000, this strategy aims to maximize profit with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale."
