"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize her to propose a lower price closer to her own perceived value of $8,000."
