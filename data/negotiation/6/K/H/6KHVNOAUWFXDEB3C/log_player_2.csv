# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,500,000? This reflects its true value while acknowledging your interest.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me.

Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's settle on $1,425,000.  This represents a considerable investment on your part, but with the potential returns, I believe it's more than justified.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,425,000 is tempting, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a middle ground.
