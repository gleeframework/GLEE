Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
