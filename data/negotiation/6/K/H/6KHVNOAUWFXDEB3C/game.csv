"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,500,000? This reflects its true value while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's settle on $1,425,000.  This represents a considerable investment on your part, but with the potential returns, I believe it's more than justified.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,425,000 is tempting, it's still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. Let's aim for $1,350,000. This would represent a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of this product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
