This offer gives me a good chance of maximizing my profits. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000. This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his valuation, especially if he values the product highly.  If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
