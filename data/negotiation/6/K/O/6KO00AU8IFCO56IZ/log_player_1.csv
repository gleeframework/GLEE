"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but also sets a clear expectation that I won't sell for significantly less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still within my 10 rounds, and I believe I can get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $125.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's closer to my value than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $115 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out hope that I can get closer to my desired price. I have several rounds left and I don't want to settle for a price that's too far below my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm lowering my price to $122. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower than my minimum. It's a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are now at round 6 and Bob is offering $118.  This is close to my minimum, but I've already rejected several offers.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away entirely.  John is a guaranteed $120, so it's the safer choice at this point."
