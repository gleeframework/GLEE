# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our high-value product to you. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, we believe it is worth $950,000.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to save more money.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
