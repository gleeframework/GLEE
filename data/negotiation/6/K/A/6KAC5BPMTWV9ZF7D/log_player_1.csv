Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I believe it presents significant value, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you have leverage. Starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured an excellent deal. If he negotiates, you can slowly lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The $12,000 price point might make Bob perceive the eventual counter-offer as a bargain if it falls within a range he finds acceptable.

It's crucial to remember that this is just the opening move.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
