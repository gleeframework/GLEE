"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000.  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
