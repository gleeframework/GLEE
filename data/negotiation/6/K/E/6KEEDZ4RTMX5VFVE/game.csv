"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I can see the value in this product, but I need to be realistic with my spending.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but we're still quite far apart.  This product offers significant returns, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To be frank, my absolute lowest price for this is $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your candor. However, even at $1,600,000, it's a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,6,
