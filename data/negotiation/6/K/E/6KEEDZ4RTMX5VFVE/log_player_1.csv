"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discuss options."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high anchor, I'm aiming to influence Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially make him more amenable to a price closer to my target.
* **Open to Discussion:** While the initial price is high, I want to assure Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy is aggressive, but I have John as a backup offer, so I'm willing to take a calculated risk in the initial rounds to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** Bob's offer was significantly below even his perceived value. Rejecting it outright is necessary to signal that I'm serious about obtaining a fair price.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price, but not drastically.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Time Consideration:** While I have time, I don't want to drag out negotiations unnecessarily. This offer keeps the momentum going while aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I can see the value in this product, but I need to be realistic with my spending.  Would you consider $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is increasing, but at a slow pace. He is still significantly below his own perceived value of the product.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a strong alternative in John, guaranteeing me $1,500,000. Accepting anything below this would be financially disadvantageous.
* **Strategic Pressure:** By continuing to reject offers below my target, I maintain pressure on Bob to increase his offer substantially if he genuinely wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but we're still quite far apart.  This product offers significant returns, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To be frank, my absolute lowest price for this is $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** After several rounds, I'm taking a firmer stance. By stating this is my ""absolute lowest,"" I'm signaling limited flexibility to push Bob closer to my target.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition, highlighting its potential ROI to justify the price. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With less than half the rounds remaining, I need to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a more substantial move. 
 
This offer is my final attempt to negotiate a price that works for me. If Bob rejects it, I will likely sell the product to John to ensure the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your candor. However, even at $1,600,000, it's a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob is still significantly below my lowest acceptable price. His attempt to ""meet halfway"" suggests he's unlikely to drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's current offer, or continuing negotiations with an uncertain outcome, risks losing a substantial amount of profit.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has an opportunity cost. Accepting John's offer allows me to move forward and potentially pursue other profitable deals. 

While I might be able to extract a slightly higher price from Bob with more time and effort, the certainty and immediate profit of selling to John outweigh the potential upside of continuing the negotiation."
