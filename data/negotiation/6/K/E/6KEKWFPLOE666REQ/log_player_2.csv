"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 and Alice is offering it for that price, there's no benefit in rejecting the offer and buying from John. You'll get the product for the same price either way."
