"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob. $95 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $105. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,
