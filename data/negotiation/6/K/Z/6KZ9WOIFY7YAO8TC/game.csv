"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $7,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you do $6,800? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $6,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  How about $7,000?  That's splitting the difference between our last two offers, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,6,
