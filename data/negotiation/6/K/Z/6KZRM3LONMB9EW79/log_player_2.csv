"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a decent price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $100. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's value. This shows he's willing to negotiate but is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasonable offer:** $115 is a fair starting point for negotiation. It gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much, while still giving Bob a decent discount.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging continued negotiation rather than pushing Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has lowered her price from $130 to $120, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** $120 is a fair price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $150 and his goal is to save money.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice raising her price again or potentially losing the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget."
