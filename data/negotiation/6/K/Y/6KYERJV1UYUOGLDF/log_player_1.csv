I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I can potentially get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $130. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's only $10 more than his initial offer, and it's closer to my ideal price point."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob has shown he's not willing to budge from his initial offer, which is only my minimum price. There's no guarantee I can get a better price from him in the next round, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
