"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to counter and potentially reach a price agreeable for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to our desired price, but we're still not at our limit. Let's try negotiating one more time before accepting defeat and going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see, $85 is getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise by suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous offer and Alice's current offer. It's possible Alice might find this agreeable, but we're also prepared to walk away and buy from John if needed."
