Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before it hits the open market. Given its unique value and the high demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than your absolute minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer,"" you aim to encourage a quicker decision from Bob.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to potentially earn more than your guaranteed sale price."
