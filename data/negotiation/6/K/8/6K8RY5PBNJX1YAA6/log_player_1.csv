"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair price, considering what you could gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, we anchor the negotiation high. This leaves room for potential concessions while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a sense of desirability.
* **Leaving Room:** We are not starting at Bob's maximum price ($1,500,000) to give him a sense of getting a potential ""deal"" if he accepts quickly. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant jump down from our initial ask. While it's still a good profit, we have room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about getting a higher price and keeps the door open for a more favorable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value this product brings is truly significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.  How about $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle, we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value without being overly aggressive, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Clear Action:** The ""How about..."" phrasing encourages Bob to respond positively to the compromise.

This approach aims to find a sweet spot that satisfies both parties while maximizing our potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise given the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly invested in negotiating a good price and is incrementally moving towards our offers. Accepting at $1,325,000 secures a significant profit of $325,000 above our minimum. While we could push for more, there's a risk of Bob losing interest or feeling frustrated with the back-and-forth. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer later."
