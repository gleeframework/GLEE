"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I am very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your proposal. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $900,000. I am unable to match that price point. Instead, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and enables us to move forward with the transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your latest proposal. In response, I am offering a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being more accessible to your current budget. I hope this offer is acceptable and looks forward to your response.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
