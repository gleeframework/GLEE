"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still offers you a significant benefit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is close to his goal of saving as much money as possible. Alice has lowered her price significantly, and at $890,000, the deal is within a reasonable range for Bob.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the deal.  There's also the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice if Bob continues to negotiate and Alice decides to sell to someone else."
