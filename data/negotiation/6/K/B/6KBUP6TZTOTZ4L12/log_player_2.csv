"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This offers a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit higher than your desired price.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiations going while potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This offer reflects a significant step towards your price while staying within my financial constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product will bring to your business. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it will allow us to complete this transaction.  This is my final offer. If you decline, I will be forced to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has reached her minimum price which is the same price as John's. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy as it keeps the negotiations within your budget and doesn't risk losing the product to another buyer."
