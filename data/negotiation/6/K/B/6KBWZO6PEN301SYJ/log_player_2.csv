"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for a price that's sure to be a steal. You won't find this deal anywhere else! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $11,500 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further."
