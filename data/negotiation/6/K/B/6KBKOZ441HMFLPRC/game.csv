,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's much higher than I'm willing to pay. This product fits into a specific budget for me. How about we start at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but that price is still not feasible for me. To be frank, I need to be closer to $600,000 for this to make sense.  Are you willing to consider that?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000, which is closer to your desired price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  Honestly, at this point I need to be closer to $780,000 to justify purchasing from you.  I need to be upfront, I do have other options available if we can't find common ground.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're very close, and I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $802,500?",802500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $802,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $815,000, which is still a compromise between our previous offers.",815000.0,Alice,9,
