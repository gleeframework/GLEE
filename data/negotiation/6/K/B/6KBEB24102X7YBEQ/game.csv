"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $937,500. This offer is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,
