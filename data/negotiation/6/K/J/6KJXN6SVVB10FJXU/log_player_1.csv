"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's worth emphasizes its value and sets a baseline.
* **Openness:**  The message invites Bob to respond and begin the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**  This strategy aims to secure a price closer to my minimum value while still being attractive to Bob. I'm setting the stage for potential counteroffers, leaving room to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below the value to Bob himself ($8,000). Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is a secure option, I'm not desperate to sell right now. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my bargaining power and continue negotiating. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  I'm lowering my price to $9,000, which is a significant step down from my initial offer of $10,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing that it's still advantageous for him while also allowing me to make a decent profit. 
* **Invite further negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer again, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between finding a middle ground with Bob and ensuring I don't sell at a significant loss. I'm aiming for a deal that is mutually beneficial and likely to close in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $8,200 is still below my desired price of $12,000, but it's getting close to my minimum of $12,000. Accepting this offer would ensure a decent profit.
* **Bob's valuation:**  $8,200 is also very close to the value Bob places on the product ($8,000), making it a reasonable price for him. 
* **Limited time:** We are already in Round 4, and we're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation rounds. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a significantly better offer.

**Strategy:**  I'm opting to accept this offer, as it balances a decent profit with the risk of further negotiation not leading to a better outcome. It's a good compromise, considering the time constraint and Bob's perceived value of the product."
