Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather take the guaranteed $150 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
