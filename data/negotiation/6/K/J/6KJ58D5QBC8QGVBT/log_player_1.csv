Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves some room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob by calling it a ""great deal."" This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he'll immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you consider selling it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $150.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $80 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit.  Would you be interested in paying $100 for the product? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I'm still unable to meet you halfway at $100. Could you consider selling the product to me for $90? This would allow me to stay within my budget while providing you with a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. I'm willing to pay $93 for the product, which is closer to your original offer. I believe this price is fair for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $93 is closer to my desired price, I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob.  I don't want to risk going back and forth again only to get a lower price.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.  I'll sell the product to John."
