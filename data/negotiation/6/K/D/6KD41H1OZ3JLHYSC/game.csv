"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is a bit lower than I can accept.  Let's compromise - I'm willing to sell the product for $1000000. This price reflects the product's true value, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
