"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is considerably below my minimum. This product has immense potential and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to make a deal, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
