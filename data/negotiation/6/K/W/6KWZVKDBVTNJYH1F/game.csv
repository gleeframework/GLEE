"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $115. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
