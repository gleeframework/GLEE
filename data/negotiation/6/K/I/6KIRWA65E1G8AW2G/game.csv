"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your budget concerns, $950,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the benefits this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
