Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
