While $975,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable with.  There's room for more negotiation, and I want to see if I can get it closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $925,000, and while it's closer to my goal, it's still above my comfort zone.  I'd rather secure the product at a lower price and avoid further negotiation.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees the best price for me and avoids further delays in getting the product."
