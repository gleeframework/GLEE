"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to compromise, which might make Bob more likely to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $80 is your limit, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth significantly more to me, and I'd like to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and significantly better than selling to John for $80.  I'm willing to close the deal and move on."
