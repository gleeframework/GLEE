"I understand you're really set on the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. This is already a very competitive price for a high-quality product like this. I'm confident you'll love it!",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $135 is slightly higher than I'd like to pay, I am willing to consider it if there are any additional benefits or incentives you could offer. However, my maximum budget remains $120.",120.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to give away the product at a loss. I can throw in a free accessory that's worth $20, which brings the total value to $155. Would you be willing to meet me at $140, considering the additional value you'll be getting?",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer with the free accessory. I appreciate the gesture, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $120. Perhaps we could come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",120.0,Bob,10,
