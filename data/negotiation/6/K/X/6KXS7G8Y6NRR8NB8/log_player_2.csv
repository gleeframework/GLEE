"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of them to compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile. It's a fair price, considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has already lowered her price, showing she's willing to negotiate. Bob can likely get a slightly better price by making another counteroffer."
