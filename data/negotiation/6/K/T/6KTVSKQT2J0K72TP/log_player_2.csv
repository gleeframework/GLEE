"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. Would you like to take it for $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can take advantage of John's $1,000,000 price, saving yourself $150,000."
