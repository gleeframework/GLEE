"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, close to my perceived value of the product, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  It also allows me to assess his interest and gauge how much I can push for in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Since I know the product is worth $120 to him, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, potentially finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to my desired amount. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product and highlighting the benefits of accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $90? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher amount. I'm confident I can secure a deal for at least $92. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price slightly above his offer, potentially finding a middle ground and securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $92 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm offering a price that's only slightly above Bob's last offer, showing him I'm willing to compromise. It's also a price that's still significantly higher than what I would receive from John, making it a good deal for me.  I'm confident that this offer will be appealing to Bob."
