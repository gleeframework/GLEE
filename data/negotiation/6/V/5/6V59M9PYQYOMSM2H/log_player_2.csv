"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the $120 from John, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price closer to Alice's value of $80.  He's offering $85, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for less than $95. He can still try to negotiate with Alice further.  While $95 is a better price than John's $120,  Bob can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's offering $90, which is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $95. This demonstrates he's willing to negotiate, but still maintains a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $92 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible. While $92 is still higher than his last offer, it's getting closer to his target and a better price than John's $120.  It's likely Alice won't go any lower, so accepting this offer is the best move for Bob.  He's also only had 5 rounds, so he still has room to potentially get a better deal in later rounds if he chooses to reject this offer."
