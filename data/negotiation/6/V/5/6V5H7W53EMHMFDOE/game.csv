"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
