Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go down to $10,500, but I'm still not willing to sell below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not budging on this, Bob. I'm willing to sell to John for $12,000 if we can't come to an agreement. Let's meet at $12,000, or I'll be forced to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firm on her $12,000 price, and has even mentioned she would sell to John at that price. This means further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. It's time to cut your losses and go with your safe option: John, who's offering the product for $8,000."
