"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start at a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth to you is $8,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a tighter budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we compromise at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000. This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $10,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go down to $10,500, but I'm still not willing to sell below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not budging on this, Bob. I'm willing to sell to John for $12,000 if we can't come to an agreement. Let's meet at $12,000, or I'll be forced to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
