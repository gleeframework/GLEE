"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You don't want to pay $150 right away if you can try to negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer of $120, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Alice to counter with a price closer to my target."
