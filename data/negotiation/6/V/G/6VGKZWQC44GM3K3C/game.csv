"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
