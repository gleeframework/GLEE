"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal through negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $10,000. This is still a great value for the product, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his budget, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. There's still a possibility that Alice will come down further, or he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $9,800. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is getting closer to his desired price, but she's still unwilling to go as low as $9,500. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking that Alice will reject his next offer.  It's better to be safe and buy from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
