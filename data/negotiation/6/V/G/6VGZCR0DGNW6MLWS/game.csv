"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1150000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and a significant profit for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider my offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a price of $1100000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us both closer to our target price. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $1075000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still not quite what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $1087500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would bring us closer to an agreement. I'm confident this is a deal we can both feel good about.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think we can do better. How about $1070000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm sticking with $1080000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves us both with a decent profit. Let's close this deal now.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
