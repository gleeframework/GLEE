"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.  I'm also trying to establish a friendly tone and focus on the value he'll get from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm still early in the process, so there's time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's price point, but still holding out for a profit. I'm also trying to be agreeable by suggesting a middle ground. I want to see if Bob will bite at this price, or if he's willing to go even higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go even higher. I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $10,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm still aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also being realistic about Bob's limitations. I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price, but I'm also highlighting the value of the product and the time invested in negotiation. This approach aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, while also ensuring I don't give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John. While I'd like to get more, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and losing out on both deals is too high."
