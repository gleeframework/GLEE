"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident that, once you see its capabilities, you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to justify the high initial price, shifting the focus from a pure number to the benefits Bob would gain.
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous as to insult Bob or make him immediately walk away.  It leaves ample space for counteroffers and discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,500,000, which is closer to my budget. Can you meet me at this price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below your initial ask and potentially leaves money on the table. You have room to negotiate, and there are still 8 rounds left to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, the development and potential of this product represent a significant investment on my end.  Could you consider a price of $2,000,000?  This feels like a more accurate reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By decreasing the price by $300,000, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still staying well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the ""development and potential"" reinforces the product's value and subtly justifies the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a middle ground, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counter closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,500,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,750,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to your desired range, you're still in a strong negotiating position. He's essentially met you halfway between your last offer and his previous one.  There's room to push for a slightly higher price, especially with several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This recognizes the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minor Concession:** You're reducing your price by another $100,000, demonstrating good faith and continued movement toward a deal.
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  The language explicitly frames this offer as a win-win solution, appealing to Bob's desire for fairness. 
* **Holding Ground:**  You're not meeting Bob's $1,750,000 offer directly but staying firm above that mark, aiming for a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000. Can you meet me at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly and sticking closely to his initial offer. This suggests he might be hesitant to go much higher.
* **Time Factor:**  While you have several rounds remaining, you're approaching the halfway point.  Continuing to negotiate for small increments might not be the most efficient use of time.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000.  The current offer from Bob is only slightly above that. 

**Strategy Going Forward:**

In the next round, consider a counteroffer that makes Bob feel like he's getting a significant concession, potentially around $1,700,000. However, be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly. You've demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and a firm stance now might encourage Bob to make a final, more appealing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, let's be real, we both see the value here.  I'm ready to close this deal.  If you can agree to $1,700,000, we have an agreement right now. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Language:**  The message is direct and firm, indicating this is a serious offer and not the time for more small increments.
* **Significant Concession:** The price drop to $1,700,000 is substantial, designed to be appealing to Bob and make him feel he's getting a good deal.
* **Introducing Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (without being dishonest) adds a level of pressure and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Final Offer:**  Framing it as your final offer signals you're at your limit, placing the ball firmly in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other interested parties, but I'm not willing to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain Potential:**  Bob is firm at $1,650,000, and it's unlikely he'll move much higher.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but the potential gain is minimal.
* **Time Cost:** You've used 8 of your 10 rounds.  Continuing to haggle for a small amount risks losing the deal altogether, leaving you with John's offer, which is lower.
* **Acceptable Outcome:** $1,650,000 is a solid profit, significantly above Bob's initial offer and a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially insignificant gain."
