"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to the value I see in the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is not within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
