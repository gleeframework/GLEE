Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that both of us can agree on."
