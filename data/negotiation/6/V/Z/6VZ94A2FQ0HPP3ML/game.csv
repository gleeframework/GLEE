"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This price reflects its true potential.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,250,000 is still considerably below its value.  I could consider $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
