"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still leaving a healthy profit margin above my minimum of $12,000.  I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is right at that minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that low without at least trying to negotiate a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a reasonable price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to counter once more. I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

This is my final attempt to get a price I'm comfortable with. $12,500 is a decent compromise that is still higher than John's offer. If Bob rejects this, I'll just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

I've reached my limit with Bob. We're too far apart in price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
