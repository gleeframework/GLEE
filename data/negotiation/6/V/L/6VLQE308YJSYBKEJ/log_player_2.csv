"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a comfortable profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
