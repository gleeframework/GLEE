This offer is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired value while maintaining a good chance of securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. There's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired value. While it's still below my minimum, it's a good compromise and allows for a quick deal.  I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
