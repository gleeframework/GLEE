Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet at $16,000. My maximum offer remains $12,000. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob is holding firm at $12,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
