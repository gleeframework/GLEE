"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? That's the highest I can go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise.  If you can go up to $135, we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer.",132.0,Bob,6,
