This is an exclusive offer tailored to discerning clients like yourself, aiming to ensure you receive the best value without compromising on quality. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's maximum price:** $10,000
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **John's price:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for his maximum price of $10,000.  While this is not ideal, it's better than accepting Alice's offer and paying more than his desired price."
