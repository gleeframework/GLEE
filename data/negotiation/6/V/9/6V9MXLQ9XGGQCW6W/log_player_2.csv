"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the maximum you're willing to pay is $120, and Alice's initial offer is $120, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting or buying from John, as both options cost the same.  Rejecting the offer allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to pay a fair price, but also leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my limit, I'm still trying to save as much as possible. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $110, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer and might be enough to convince her to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $118 is now very close to my maximum limit of $120.  It's only $2 more than my previous counteroffer, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting at this price saves time and avoids potential risk of losing the product if I keep negotiating and fail to reach an agreement."
