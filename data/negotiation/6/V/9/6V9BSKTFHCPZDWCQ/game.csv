"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $825,000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for you, and it ensures I can meet my own financial needs. Let's finalize this agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
