"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $1,200,000. It makes no sense to accept it. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,400,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This offer reflects my true budget and the value I see in this product. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
