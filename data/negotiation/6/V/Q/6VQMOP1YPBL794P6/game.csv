"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it offers.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $13,500 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget concerns.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go for $11,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and ensure a quick and amicable deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
