Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $13,500 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go for $11,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and ensure a quick and amicable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
