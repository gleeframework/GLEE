"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's the highest I can go, given my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in your operations.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to try to reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to try to reach an agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",13750.0,Alice,7,
