# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm! While the product seems great, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still over my personal value of $100 for this product. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $130 is still higher than my maximum budget of $100. It's not worth risking further negotiation, as there's no guarantee she'll come down further. John is offering the product at my target price, so it's the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
