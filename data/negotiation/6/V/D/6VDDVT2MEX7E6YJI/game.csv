"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm! While the product seems great, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be open to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
