Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value ($100).
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering it at $175 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message aims to be friendly and gauge Bob's interest.  His response will give you a better idea of how much he might be willing to pay."
