Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a long time, and I'm confident it can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This price represents a fair value considering the potential you stand to gain. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth it in the long run. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $950,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** I've used a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob. I've also acknowledged the significant investment but emphasized the long-term worth.
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I earn $150,000 more than my minimum. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
