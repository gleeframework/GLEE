"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and $90 is more than his maximum budget of $80.  While John offers a fair price, Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than his maximum budget of $80. This is a reasonable starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, as he might be able to get the price down further. He can also consider John's offer as a backup option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $80. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. It's a fair offer, and hopefully, Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, Bob can always choose to buy from John."
