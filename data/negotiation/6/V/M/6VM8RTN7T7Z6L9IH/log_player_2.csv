"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much higher than $1000000.  I understand you may not be familiar with its full worth, but I'm confident it could be a game-changer for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1500000.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. There's no incentive to accept, as you can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or exploring other options."
