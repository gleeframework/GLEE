Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your $12,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $14,000 is less than Bob's $15,000 value. This gives him room to negotiate if he wants to. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly less than my minimum of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $11,500 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm keeping a close eye on John as my backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me.  How about $12,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not sure he'll budge any further. I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and lose out on a sale. John is a safe bet, and I can get the same price from him. I'm going to sell to John."
