{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * Below John's offer, ensuring Alice still makes a substantial profit if Bob accepts.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This initial offer is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can negotiate further. The key is to find a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal before exploring the guaranteed offer from John."
