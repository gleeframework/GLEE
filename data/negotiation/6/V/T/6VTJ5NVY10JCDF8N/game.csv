"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that is within our both budgets.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
