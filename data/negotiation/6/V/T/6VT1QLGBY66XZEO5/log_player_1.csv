Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, allowing for potential negotiation and a win-win scenario. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:**  A high initial offer can influence Bob's perception and make him more likely to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price point.  I believe I can still get closer to my target by counter-offering.  Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate, so there's potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to meet you halfway. This price still allows you to benefit significantly from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
