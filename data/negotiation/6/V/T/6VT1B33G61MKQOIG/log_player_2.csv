"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good starting point, but I have room to negotiate. Since my maximum budget is $12,000, I can afford to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $700.
