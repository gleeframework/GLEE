"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By setting the price at $1,750,000, I allow for some bargaining room while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly tone in my message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** I have time to negotiate and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000.** While tempting, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low at this time.  The product's value is significantly higher than that, and I need to recoup my investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer, and it's a price I believe is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why I can't accept Bob's low offer.
* **Framing it as a discount:**  I position my counteroffer as a ""discount"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Maintaining a firm but friendly tone:** I want to keep the negotiation moving forward without appearing too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **We're getting closer:**  Bob is getting closer to my price, but I'm not ready to settle yet. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to hold out for a slightly better offer.
* **John's offer is still an option:**  If Bob doesn't come up, I can always sell to John and guarantee myself $1,500,000.

I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll need to be careful to avoid going too low and jeopardizing my potential profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your continued interest, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1,550,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's offer ($1,400,000). 
* **Emphasizing finality:**  I'm letting Bob know this is my final offer before I consider other options. This creates urgency and pressure for him to accept.
* **Reinforcing the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Maintaining a firm but respectful tone:** I want to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price but that I'm also open to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I'm still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1,450,000 for your product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **We're getting closer, but I'm not desperate:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still not enough. 
* **Time is still on my side:** I have 4 rounds left.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If Bob doesn't meet my minimum, I can always sell to John and guarantee myself $1,500,000.

I'm going to counteroffer one last time, but if Bob doesn't accept, I'll be forced to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your continued interest, but I really need to be at $1,500,000 to make this deal work. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm ready to close right now if you agree.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer. I'm firm on my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Urgency:** I emphasize the ""ready to close right now"" aspect to create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Direct Approach:**  I'm being direct and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation.  This helps prevent any further back-and-forth.
* **Focus on ""Closing"":**  I'm using language like ""close right now"" to make it clear that I'm ready to finalize the deal.

If Bob doesn't accept, I will move forward and sell the product to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway, but I'm still not able to go above $1,450,000. I hope you can understand my position. I would like to propose one last offer of $1,450,000 for your product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  I've already made my final offer, and he's not willing to budge. 
* **We're out of time.** There are only two rounds left, and I don't have time for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000.** This is the best option for me at this point. I'd rather secure the deal with John and ensure my minimum profit. 

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, it's important for me to secure the best possible outcome for myself."
