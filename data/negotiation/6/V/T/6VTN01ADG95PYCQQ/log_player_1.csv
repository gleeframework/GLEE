**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementing his offers in very small amounts. This suggests he is very price-sensitive and unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean a loss of $220,000 compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
