"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,750,000 for it, considering its unique features and value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,750,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can use this opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.

I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident this product will deliver great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to show respect and continue the dialogue.

* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially push the price up further.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems like we've reached a stalemate.  Further negotiation may not yield a better result. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. It's a safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Time is Limited:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Selling to John is the best way to ensure a successful transaction and reach my minimum goal."
