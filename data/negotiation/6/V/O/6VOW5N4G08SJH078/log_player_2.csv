"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money on the purchase. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your limit. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,200,000, you can accept this offer.  There's a good chance you could get a better price with more negotiation, but taking Alice's offer secures the product while minimizing your risk."
