"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out.  While I recognize the value of your product, $2,300,000 is quite a bit higher than I had budgeted. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents what I believe to be its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair offer for both of us.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $1,350,000? I think that's a fair offer, reflecting the product's value while staying within a reasonable budget for me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I had in mind, I'm willing to accept that price if you can assure me this is your final offer.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
