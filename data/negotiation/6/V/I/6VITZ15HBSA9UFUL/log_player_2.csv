Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount from the value you place on the product, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?
