Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $950,000 is above your $800,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It allows you to assess Bob's interest:** If Bob immediately accepts, great! If he counters, you can gauge his willingness to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $850,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount from the value you place on the product, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my ideal price point.  I believe I can still push for a higher amount. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $875,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle at $890,000? This is a final offer, and it's a good compromise for both of us. If you agree, we can finalize the sale. Otherwise, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would have preferred a bit more, Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my bottom line.  The negotiation has been long, and continuing could risk losing him as a buyer altogether. It's time to secure the deal."
