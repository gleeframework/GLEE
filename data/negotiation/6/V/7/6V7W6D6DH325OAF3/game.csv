"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount for me and a fair price considering your cost.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is closer to my initial offer.  This shows good faith, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for the best possible deal, I understand the need to find a compromise. How about we settle this at $887,500?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure it feels like a win-win for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
