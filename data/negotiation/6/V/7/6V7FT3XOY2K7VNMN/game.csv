"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
