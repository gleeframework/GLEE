"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($100). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is still within my budget and a good price considering the product is worth $100 to her. Accepting the offer saves me money compared to buying from John and keeps the negotiation process short."
