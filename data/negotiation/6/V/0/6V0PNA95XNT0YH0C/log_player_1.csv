Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is a good starting point that's still below Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $20 difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value creates space for negotiation, ensuring a potential win-win situation.
* **Knowing my fallback:** I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $115 is still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Counter-offer potential:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **No need to rush:**  I have a fallback option with John, so I can afford to be patient and continue negotiating for a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him closer to my initial asking price or find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a compromise:** My counteroffer of $125 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal for Bob. This helps to create a positive framing for the negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in completely. By offering $125, I leave room for further negotiation if Bob rejects my offer.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties while ensuring I can still make a decent profit."
