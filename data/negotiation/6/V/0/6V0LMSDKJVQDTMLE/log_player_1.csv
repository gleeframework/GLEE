Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me, and you're getting a good deal as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer in the next round. I believe we can still reach an agreement without needing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,875?  This would be a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10875}
