"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me, and you're getting a good deal as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,875?  This would be a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",10875.0,Alice,5,
