I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1500000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you think my initial price was a bit high, but I'm confident the product's value to you is even higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I think the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
