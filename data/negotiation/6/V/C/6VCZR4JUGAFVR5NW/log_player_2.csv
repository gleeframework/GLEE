{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $900,000.
* This counteroffer is still within my budget of $1,200,000.

* I want to see if I can get a lower price by making another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $825,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also keeps the price below her last offer.
* This offer is still within my budget, and it's closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* It's a reasonable compromise that might be acceptable to Alice."
