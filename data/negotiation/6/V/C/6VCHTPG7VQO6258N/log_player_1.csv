"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand where you're coming from. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This product really does offer exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its performance."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we possibly do $12,000?  I feel like that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a price I might consider, the gap is still significant and I'm not confident he'll reach my minimum in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
