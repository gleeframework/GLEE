"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand where you're coming from. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This product really does offer exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its performance.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we possibly do $12,000?  I feel like that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
