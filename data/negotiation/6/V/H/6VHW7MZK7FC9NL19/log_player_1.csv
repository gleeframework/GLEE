{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to a compromise to encourage Bob to engage in a negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, increasing his motivation to buy. 

This offer balances a high starting price with a willingness to negotiate, aiming to get the best possible deal while keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his offer suggests he's willing to pay more than $8,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's proposal.  This will hopefully lead to a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** By offering $10,500, I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to reinforce the justification for the proposed price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging continued negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable price without risking a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's also only slightly less than my previous counteroffer of $10,500.  There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might lower his price even further, but it's also possible that he might walk away from the deal entirely. 

Given that selling to John would only net me $8,000, accepting Bob's offer at $9,750 guarantees a higher profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
