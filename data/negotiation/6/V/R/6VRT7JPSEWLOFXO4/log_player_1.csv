Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy right now.

If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.
