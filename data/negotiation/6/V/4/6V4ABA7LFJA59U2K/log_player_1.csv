Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $100 is more than $80, giving Bob some room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 

Remember,  I'm always keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to find the product at a lower price. I would like to propose $90 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $90 is slightly lower than my initial offer, it's still a good price considering that Bob is willing to go up from his $80 valuation and it's above my minimum of $120. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection."
