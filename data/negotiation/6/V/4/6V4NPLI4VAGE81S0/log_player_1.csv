Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its true worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while leaving the door open for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. By starting with a high price, I create leverage and can potentially secure a better deal than selling to John. However, I also want to ensure a smooth negotiation process. By being flexible and willing to counteroffer, I hope to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than what the product is worth to Bob, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't at least partially compensate me for the product's value. By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,000,000, a compromise from my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price within a reasonable range for me. 
* **Message:** I've emphasized my appreciation for Bob's interest, but also reiterated that I need a price that meets my minimum requirements. The message maintains a friendly tone while asserting my position.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to find a middle ground. By lowering my price, I'm showing Bob that I'm flexible and want to make a deal. However, by not lowering the price too much, I still maintain a good profit margin and demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise my own financial goals.  At this point, I've already lowered my price twice, and further negotiations are unlikely to get us to a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I achieve my desired outcome. 

**Strategy:**

This decision is based on my commitment to a minimum profit margin.  Although more negotiation is possible, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk that I will end up with a price that is too low.  Selling to John is the most sensible option as it guarantees a satisfactory outcome."
