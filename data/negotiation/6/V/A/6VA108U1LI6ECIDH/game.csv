"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $13250, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13250.0,Alice,5,
