,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $95. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to buy it from you.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I'm not able to go higher than $95.  That's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.  Let me know what you decide.",95.0,Bob,6,
