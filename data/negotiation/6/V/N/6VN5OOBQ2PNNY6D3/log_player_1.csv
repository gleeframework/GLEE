Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth much more to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. This is a common strategy in bargaining.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me, hoping to subtly suggest it's worth more than the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Know Your Market:**  Research similar products to get a better understanding of potential market value. This can help you determine a realistic starting point.
* **Be Willing to Walk Away:**  Remember, you have a safety net with John's offer of $12,000. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to explore if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my original offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is a good deal at this price, emphasizing its value.
* **Keep it Open:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by asking for Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for a price around $11000? This would allow us to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum desired price of $12,000. Considering the potential for further negotiation, I'm willing to accept his offer. This is a good compromise that allows me to sell the product without losing too much, and also maintains a positive relationship with Bob for future potential deals."
