"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.** You're aiming to spend no more than $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is $950,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a backup option at $1,000,000.

By rejecting the initial offer, you open the door to potentially get a lower price from Alice."

This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product within my budget and leaving you with a good profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price range.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $925,000 is still higher than the $850,000 you countered with.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility by lowering her price. This suggests further negotiation is possible. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If you don't reach an agreement with Alice, you have a fallback option. 

By rejecting Alice's offer again, you keep the door open for a potentially better price."
