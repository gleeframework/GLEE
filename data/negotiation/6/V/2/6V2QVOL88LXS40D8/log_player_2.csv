Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, Alice has already dropped her price significantly, and it's only $50,000 above Bob's maximum budget. It's unlikely he can get a significantly better deal."
