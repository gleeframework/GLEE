Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price that's likely to be acceptable to Bob, but it also leaves some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that shows my willingness to negotiate while still getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is still better than selling to John for $80. I'll accept the offer and sell the product to Bob."
