"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to significantly reduce the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob, especially considering he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and Bob being forced to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
