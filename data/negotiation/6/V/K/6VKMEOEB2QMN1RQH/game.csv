"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. $9,500 is still too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to consider it.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,6,
