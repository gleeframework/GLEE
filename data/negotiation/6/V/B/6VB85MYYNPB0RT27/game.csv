"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? I'm willing to pay a bit less since it's not exactly what I was looking for.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not sure if I'm willing to pay $115. I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $112? I'm trying to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,4,
