"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob can pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in your product but I'd be willing to pay $1100000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $1,100,000 is significantly less than my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **I have room to negotiate:**  I still have 9 rounds left, so I can try to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:**  While John's offer is my minimum, it's still a guaranteed profit and a good fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering $1,300,000 is a compromise that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1200000? This is the absolute maximum I'm able to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need to risk further negotiations:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject it and further negotiations could lead to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **John's offer is equal to Bob's:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves me time and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with him.

I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and sell him the product for $1,200,000."
