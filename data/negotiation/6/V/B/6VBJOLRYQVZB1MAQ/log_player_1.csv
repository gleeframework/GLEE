Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $15,000 gives you a chance to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significantly higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it implies scarcity and desirability by mentioning a public listing. This could encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer.  You have a strong fallback position with John."
