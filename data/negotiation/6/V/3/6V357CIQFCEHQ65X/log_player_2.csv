"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and give you an idea of the product's true value to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price point.  Accepting ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation rounds. While potentially getting a slightly lower price is always desirable, the risk of further negotiation breaking down and losing the product is not worth it at this point."
