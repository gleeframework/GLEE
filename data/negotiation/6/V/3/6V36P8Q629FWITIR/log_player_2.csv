"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This seems like a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money but is starting to concede.  He is offering a price that is closer to Alice's offer, but still lower. This shows good faith and signals that he is serious about getting a deal."
