"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit below my minimum threshold. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the unique features and benefits of this product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

How about we meet at $1,000,000? This price aligns with my minimum requirements, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.
