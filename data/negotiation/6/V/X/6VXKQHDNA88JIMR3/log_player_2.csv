"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I think you might be that buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further. There's a chance I can get the product for an even lower price by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is a good deal, there's still some room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get the price down further. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying right now.  To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while ensuring you receive a good value for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it's getting close to what I'm willing to pay. While I could try to push for a lower price, it's possible Alice is firm on $815,000. There's always a risk of her rejecting my counteroffer, and then I'd be stuck with John's $1,000,000 price. Accepting the $815,000 offer secures the product at a price that's still within my budget and saves me $185,000 compared to buying from John."
