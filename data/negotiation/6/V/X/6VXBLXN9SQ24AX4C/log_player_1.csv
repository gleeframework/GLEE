"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll end up closer to your target price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, I'm aiming to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counter-offers might be influenced by this higher starting point.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I have another buyer, negotiating with Bob first allows me to potentially secure an even better deal. This initial offer gives me space to negotiate down while still staying above John's guaranteed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  It's clear we have a lot of ground to cover in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by countering.  There's still plenty of room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you'll see. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. This large drop aims to encourage him to make a more substantial counter-offer in the next round.
* **Staying Above John:**  While I'm negotiating, it's crucial to remain above John's $1,200,000 offer. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce why my offer is still reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum and my previous counteroffer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's time to send a counteroffer that reflects the urgency of closing the deal while staying closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm reducing my price slightly to demonstrate flexibility but staying close to my $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the price and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Preparing for Alternatives:** By setting a firm stance now, I'm preparing to walk away from the negotiation and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my price."
