"It seems like we're still quite far apart on price. To be honest, anything over $80 is pushing it for me. I could do $75, but that's my absolute limit.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,5,
