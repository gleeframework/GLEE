Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies value that might justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response (acceptance, counter-offer, or rejection) will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy a product he values."
