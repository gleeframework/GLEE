You can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  There's room to haggle since Alice values the product at $1,000,000 and you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000."

I'm offering Alice $900,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than her offer but still within my budget."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a price closer to my initial counteroffer."

I'm offering $925,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price we can both agree on."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
