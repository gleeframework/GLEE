Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point that allows for some negotiation room while still securing a decent profit for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'll keep John as a backup option, ensuring I get at least $12,000 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal target and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also ensures I get closer to my desired price.  If Bob rejects this, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my minimum requirement of $12,000. I've already wasted a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap quickly.  To secure the best possible price and avoid further delays, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
