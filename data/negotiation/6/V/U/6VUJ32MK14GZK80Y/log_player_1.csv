Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that he'll automatically reject it.

**The Offer**

Here's a possible offer, balancing these factors:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:** You project confidence in the product's value.
* **Higher Price:** $1,600,000 is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It also nets you a profit above your guaranteed sale price.
* **No Mention of John:**  It's strategically advantageous not to reveal your alternative buyer at this point. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. Negotiation is dynamic.  Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
