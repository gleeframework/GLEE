Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be higher to you, but based on my research and needs, I am looking to purchase it for $120. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135 to make this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the market value, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. I hope this suggestion is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum, and I'm worried about running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk getting less or selling to John for my minimum."
