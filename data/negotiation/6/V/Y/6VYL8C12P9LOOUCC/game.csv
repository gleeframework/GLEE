"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price. This offer reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it will bring you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I'm serious about acquiring this product, and I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While your offer is tempting, I can't accept anything below $975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
