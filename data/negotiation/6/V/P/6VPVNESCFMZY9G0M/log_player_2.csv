Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $10,800, which is still higher than what Bob can get from John ($10,000). Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's most beneficial to buy the product from John."
