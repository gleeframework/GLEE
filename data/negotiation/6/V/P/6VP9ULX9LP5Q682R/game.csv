,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $170, but I'm really looking to spend around $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend around $120, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll meet you at $140. It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $135. Let's see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll come down to $138. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",138.0,Alice,7,
