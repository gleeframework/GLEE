"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is too low for this product. It's high quality and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, which would be $14,500. Can we consider this offer?",14500.0,Bob,4,
