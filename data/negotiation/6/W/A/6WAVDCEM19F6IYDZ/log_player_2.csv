"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $12,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity to get a valuable asset at a great price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal. While you could reject it hoping for a lower price, there's a risk she won't budge and you'll end up paying John $15,000. Saving $3,000 is a significant amount."
