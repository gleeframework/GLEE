Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying significantly above your minimum price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal that's significantly more profitable than your fallback option with John."
