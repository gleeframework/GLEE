{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be highly valuable for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000, which reflects the significant worth I place on it.  Let's discuss how this product can benefit you and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I believe the product is worth more and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1625000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. While I'd like to get more, I'm aware that negotiating with Bob has already taken several rounds. To avoid risking a stalemate and losing a potential sale, I'll accept this offer. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the sale than potentially lose out by continuing negotiations."
