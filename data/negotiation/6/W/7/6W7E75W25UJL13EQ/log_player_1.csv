""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other potential buyers."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Our offer needs to be attractive enough to him while still generating a significant profit for us.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a deal, paying $400,000 less than his perceived value.
    * We earn $400,000 more than Bob's initial valuation and avoid potential delays associated with selling to John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other potential buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" we nudge Bob towards a quicker decision."
