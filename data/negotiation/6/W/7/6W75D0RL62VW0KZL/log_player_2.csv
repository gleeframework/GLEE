"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $15000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. It's too early to commit without knowing if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still above my target price of $12,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $14000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offers and is closer to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
