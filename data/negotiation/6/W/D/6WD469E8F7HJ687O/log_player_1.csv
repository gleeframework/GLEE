Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.  
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Positive Language:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a chance Bob will reject a high initial offer. You'll need to decide if you want to negotiate down or stick with your guaranteed sale to John."
