"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a significant return on your investment.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, which reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my financial constraints. This offer is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1080000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1080000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to ensure the deal is truly beneficial for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1060000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to my business. ",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1070000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you and the value it will bring to your business.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
