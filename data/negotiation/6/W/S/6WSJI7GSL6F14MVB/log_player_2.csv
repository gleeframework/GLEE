"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm looking for $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure an even lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to invest a bit less initially. Would you be willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product?  I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this investment, and allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your willingness to invest in it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference -  I'm offering $1,025,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,025,000 offer. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This price is closer to your original offer, but still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

With several rounds left, there's still room for compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's try to bridge the gap once more. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,070,000. This price is closer to your original offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, with only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases.  

* **Potential Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, there's a chance Alice will become less flexible, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at $1,200,000. 

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from Alice at $1,070,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price. 

By accepting this offer, Bob secures a good price and avoids the potential risks of further negotiation."
