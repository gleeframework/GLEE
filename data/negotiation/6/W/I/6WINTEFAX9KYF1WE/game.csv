"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a good starting point for us to negotiate further.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which would be $12,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12750.0,Bob,4,
