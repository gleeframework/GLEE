""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of other buyers might entice him to pay a premium. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Creating a sense of urgency might push Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, we can adjust our price accordingly, knowing our absolute minimum is $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale to John)."
