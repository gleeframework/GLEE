"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial price. This product offers you a substantial return on investment, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. However, this product truly offers exceptional value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal as well. Let's settle at $1,025,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of what you're getting.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
