"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $20,000 represents the value I place on this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we settle at $17,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its potential benefits for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. That's the highest I can go, unfortunately.",14000.0,Bob,4,
