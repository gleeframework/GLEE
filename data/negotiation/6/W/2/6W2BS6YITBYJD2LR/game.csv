"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
