Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob is truly interested, this gives us the highest possible starting point.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob immediately rejects, it signals that he may be unwilling to pay a significant amount.

This also gives us room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still ensuring a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  By rejecting, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** It shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially increase the offer:**  I can counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Explore if Bob is serious:** If he's truly interested, he might increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $920,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting closer to my desired value and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, it seems like a fair deal and a good profit."
