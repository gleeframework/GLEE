"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than $8000 to me and much less than the $15000 it's worth to you.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down to $12000, but I'm still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10000 is tempting, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close the deal quickly.",11000.0,Alice,3,
