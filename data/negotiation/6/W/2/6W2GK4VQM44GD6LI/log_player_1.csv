Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down to $12000, but I'm still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
