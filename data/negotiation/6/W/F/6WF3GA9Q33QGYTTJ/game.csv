"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm not sure $1,000,000 is the right price for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work towards an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,025,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers and offer $987,500.  This seems like a fair price that allows us both to move forward. What do you think?",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $987,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. How about we meet at $1,012,500, and I'll throw in some additional support and services that will enhance the product's value?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
