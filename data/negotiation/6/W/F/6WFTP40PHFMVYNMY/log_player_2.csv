# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
$11,500 is a good deal.  It's still less than your maximum and Alice is probably not going to go lower."
