"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's make a deal!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
