"Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $100, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? ",102.5,Bob,4,
