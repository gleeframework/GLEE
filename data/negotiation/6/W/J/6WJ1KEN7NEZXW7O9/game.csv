"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands!  I'm offering it to you for $1400000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, as you know. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1100000?  This is a fair compromise considering our shared goals.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, Alice, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
