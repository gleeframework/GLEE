"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? That's the highest I can go right now.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I can do $165, which is a compromise between our two prices. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $165 is still above my limit.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going as low as $145. How about we meet in the middle of my previous offer and your last offer, which would be $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
