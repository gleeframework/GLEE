Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially negotiate. 
* **Value proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value can help Bob see the potential worth.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer.
* If negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:**  While $90 is a better price than $80 (what it's worth to Bob), it's still below my $100 minimum.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100 if I can't get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $90 and $100, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $95, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing the ""fair price for both of us"" helps frame the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall, I'll sell to John for $100 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to pay that price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get $95, there's a chance Bob might accept a higher price in the next round. However, there's also a risk of him walking away.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'll keep John in mind as a backup option in case the deal with Bob falls through."
