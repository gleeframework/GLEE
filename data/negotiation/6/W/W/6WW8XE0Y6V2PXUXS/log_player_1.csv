{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit. If he rejects, I can see what counteroffer he makes. If it's not acceptable, I can always turn to John and sell him the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell the product, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also much lower than the value of the product to him, which is $12,000. 

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired price. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $12,500."
