"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
