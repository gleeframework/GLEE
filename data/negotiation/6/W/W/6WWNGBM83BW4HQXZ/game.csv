"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $675,000. Would that work for you?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $690,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",690000.0,Alice,5,
