Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000, I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind while also implying it could be worth even more to him.
* **Time Pressure:**  Hinting that other buyers exist (""before I make it available to others"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable. If I knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive, I might start lower.
* **Risk:** There's always a chance Bob rejects the offer, and I have to settle for $10,000 from John. However, the potential for a higher profit makes this risk worthwhile."
