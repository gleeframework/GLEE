"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is offering the product for that price, it makes the most sense to buy from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation with Alice, as you might end up paying more."
