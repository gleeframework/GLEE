"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm confident the product will be worth more to you than that in the long run. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet your price of $11,000. I would like to propose an offer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value I seek from the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
