{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My asking price is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows for a potential back-and-forth while still aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely he'll be willing to go higher. I'll try to counter and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, given the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
