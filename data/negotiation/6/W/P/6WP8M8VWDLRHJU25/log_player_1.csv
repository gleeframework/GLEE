""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer it for less than his valuation plus a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $9,500 is a high starting point, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and for Alice to potentially still meet her minimum price.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed backup offer from John at $10,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out completely."
