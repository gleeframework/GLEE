"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $107.50?  That's still a great price for a product you value at $100.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to continue our discussion and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could we consider $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for $109.  Let's meet in the middle. This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",109.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and would like to propose $108. I believe this is a fair compromise given my budget constraints.",108.0,Bob,6,
