"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for it. What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm afraid $1750000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1900000. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1800000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a determined buyer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $1850000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and so am I. I'm willing to go up to $1825000, which is a good compromise.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this.",1825000.0,Bob,6,
