"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I can still potentially make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking of offering $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to what I want.  I need to maximize my profit, and selling to John is always a safe option, but I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for us to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for anything below $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my goal.  Selling to John is always a safe option, but I'm determined to get the best possible price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product while giving us both a chance to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best option at this point."
