"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 is below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now at $1,850,000?  This is my final offer.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
