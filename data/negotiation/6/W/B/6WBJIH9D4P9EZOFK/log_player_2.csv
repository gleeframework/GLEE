{""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground between Alice's $850,000 and my desired price. This counteroffer demonstrates my serious intent to buy while also showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my initial counteroffer. While it is better than her first offer, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing flexibility while staying below Alice's new price. This counteroffer is a compromise, potentially leading to a quick agreement."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her current offer is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  It's likely we're close to a final agreement.  While I could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and ending the negotiation is high.  Accepting her offer is the most sensible choice, as it saves me $225,000 compared to buying from John."
