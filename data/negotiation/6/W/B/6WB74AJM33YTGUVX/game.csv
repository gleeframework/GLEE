"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still unable to accept that offer.  However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident this product will be worth even more than that to you in the long run.  Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
