Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000. What do you think?

Round 4

Bob is moving closer to my bottom line, but I'm not willing to settle at $725,000 yet. I'll try to push him a bit further in the next round."
