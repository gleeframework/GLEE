Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is higher than what it's worth to him, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob offered. I believe this price is a fair midpoint that could potentially lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that negotiations with Bob haven't gone as smoothly as hoped, I'm not willing to settle for $85. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe that John's offer of $120 is a much better deal."
