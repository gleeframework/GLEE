"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $125.  That way we both get a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $127.50?",127.5,Alice,5,
