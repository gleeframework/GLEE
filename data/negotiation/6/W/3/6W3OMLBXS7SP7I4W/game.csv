,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the discount, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
