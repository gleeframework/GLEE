Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Still attractive compared to your backup offer ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John.  A skilled negotiator might try to low-ball you. 
* **Relationship Building:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive pricing strategy might be preferable."
