"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit too high for me, Alice. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than $70.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, so I'm going to see if I can get him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $70 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $75. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $75 is still better than selling to John for $80. It's a good compromise and secures a sale."
