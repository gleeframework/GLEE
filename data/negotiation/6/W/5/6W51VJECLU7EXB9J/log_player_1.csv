Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable too. I'm happy to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than it's worth to you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows he's getting a deal, as the product is worth $12,000 to him, but there's still space for him to counter.
* **It shows confidence:**  Starting with a slightly higher price demonstrates that you value the product and are not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating, as you're not likely to get a better price.  You've already established a strong starting point and Bob is willing to pay your minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal than risk getting a lower price or running out of time."
