""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential. I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is the highest I can go. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $980,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $980,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a significant offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, I'm still willing to risk another round of negotiation. We're getting into the later rounds, and the difference between his offer and John's offer is significant enough to try and push for a better deal."

""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad to see we're moving closer to a deal.  To be fair and transparent, I need to be above $965,000.  This is my final offer.  I think it's important for us to reach a decision on this today. What are your thoughts?"",
