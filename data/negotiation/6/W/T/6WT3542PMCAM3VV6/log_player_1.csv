Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage, allowing me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary. This can put pressure on Bob to increase his offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the price as fair.
* **Pressure and Incentive:** By meeting halfway, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision, while also giving him an incentive to accept the offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $120 is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum, so I'm keeping my options open for a better deal while still maintaining leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  At this point, I believe further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John Provides the Best Outcome:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Choosing John eliminates the risk of Bob continuing to offer lower prices, which could potentially drag out the negotiation further."
