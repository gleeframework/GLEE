Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. If he rejects the offer, I can then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to accept it just yet. There's a chance I could get a slightly better price through further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:**  This might make Bob more willing to increase his offer.
* **Gain information:** I can learn more about Bob's budget and motivation for purchasing the product.
* **Explore other options:**  If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000 to make this deal work. This reflects the value I know this product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but still offering a price that's higher than his initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value again to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Open to Closing the Deal:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially accept my offer. 

This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the need to potentially secure a sale. If Bob rejects this offer, I can then evaluate whether to sell to John or make another counteroffer, depending on his response and my assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and within a reasonable range, considering my previous counteroffer. Accepting his offer secures a sale and allows me to avoid potentially further negotiations. 

While I could potentially try for another counteroffer, it's unlikely that Bob will go higher. It's better to secure a sale now and avoid the risk of losing him as a buyer."
