"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, the product's value is quite high, and $1,400,000 wouldn't be doing it justice. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This would represent a significant discount from my initial offer and still be a win for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
