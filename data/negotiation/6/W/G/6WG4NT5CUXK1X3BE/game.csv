"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to make a deal. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. It's a compromise that I think is reasonable given the product's value.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a good price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $115, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
