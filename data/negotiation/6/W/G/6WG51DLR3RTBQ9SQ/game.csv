"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that considers your budget and my bottom line. Let's make this deal happen!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  However, $8,875 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000, but I won't go any lower. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to go down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,6,
