"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation and leaves little room for me to negotiate a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?

Alice is negotiating, but I believe there's still room for her to come down closer to her valuation. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can secure a better deal."
