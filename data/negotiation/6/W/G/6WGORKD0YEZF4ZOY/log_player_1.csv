Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob seems firm on his $12,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting stuck at or only slightly above Bob's $12,000 offer."
