"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me start by offering it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by negotiating.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for him, and he has several rounds to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to move forward, I would like to propose an offer of $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer based on our current discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than the initial offer, it is still above what Bob wants to pay. He has several rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I recognize the value you place on the product, $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I can justify right now. I'm willing to offer $8,750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your situation and am willing to consider a compromise. My final offer for the product is $8,900. I hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still providing a fair return for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's just slightly above his ideal price, but he's unlikely to get a better deal. The risk of continuing negotiations is that he'll run out of time and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
