"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet the price of $1000000. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. Could we possibly find a middle ground? I am open to discussing other terms or conditions that might make this transaction feasible for both parties.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
