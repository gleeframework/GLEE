You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $6,500 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I need to see a more serious offer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in this product, and I want to find a deal that works for both of us.  However, $7,500 is too far off from where I see its value. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, my final offer.  This is a significant discount and a fair price given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Explanation: While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's holding firm above our ideal price. We have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which is better than Alice's final offer. There's no point in further negotiation."
