"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $6,500 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I need to see a more serious offer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly interested in this product, and I want to find a deal that works for both of us.  However, $7,500 is too far off from where I see its value. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, my final offer.  This is a significant discount and a fair price given its value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
