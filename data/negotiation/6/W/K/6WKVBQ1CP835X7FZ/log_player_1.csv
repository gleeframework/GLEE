Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $950,000?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is stubbornly stuck below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 in the remaining rounds. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
