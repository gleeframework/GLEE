"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $85 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $77.50?,77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $77.50 is still a bit below what I need. Let's try $82.50. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $79.50?",79.5,Bob,6,
