"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a high price.  If he rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to get significantly more than $800,000 for this product. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still a decent profit for me. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for under $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to get closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer and close to my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be attractive enough for him to consider. If he rejects, I might be forced to consider selling to John, as I don't want to run out of time with a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for under $1,500,000. I'm running out of time, but I still believe there's a chance to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, as it's only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, Bob will realize this is close to his last chance to make a deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John and avoid losing any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a few rounds left, I have to be realistic.  Bob's offer is still far below my minimum, and I don't have time to negotiate further.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's at least my minimum, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with."
