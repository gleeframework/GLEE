Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    * Attractive enough that Bob might accept it to avoid missing out, especially with the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" framing.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell to John at our desired price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential for higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
