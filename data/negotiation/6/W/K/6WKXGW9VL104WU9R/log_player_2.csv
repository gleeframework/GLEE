Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $1700000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.
