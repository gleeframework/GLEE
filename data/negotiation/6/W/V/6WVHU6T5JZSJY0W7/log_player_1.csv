"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also establishes a strong starting point, signaling that I believe the product is valuable.  I'm aiming for the best possible price, but I'm also prepared to accept a lower offer if needed.  I'll closely analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer again. I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject this offer. I believe there's still room to negotiate higher. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target price of $15,000.  I'm keeping the option to sell to John in mind, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm countering with $15,500. This is a final compromise, as it's just above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but the negotiation is taking too long.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he'll walk away completely.  $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and John is a guaranteed buyer at that amount.  It's time to secure the sale and avoid further risk."
