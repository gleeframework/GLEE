"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very special product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's start the conversation with a price of $1,050,000. This gives you a slight discount while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.
