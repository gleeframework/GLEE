Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm considering that Bob might be willing to pay more if he values the product highly. We'll see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but still want to make sure I get a reasonable price.  $17,500 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
