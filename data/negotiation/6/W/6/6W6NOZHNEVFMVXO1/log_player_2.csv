Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice has reached her lowest price:** Her message indicates she won't go lower than $100.
* **Matching John's price:**  Accepting Alice's $100 offer means you achieve the same price as buying from John.
* **Avoiding further negotiation risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice backing out, forcing you to buy from John at $100 anyway."
