"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $137.50.  Let me know if that works for you.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's try to find some common ground here.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $126.25? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's close this out and make it happen.",126.25,Alice,5,
