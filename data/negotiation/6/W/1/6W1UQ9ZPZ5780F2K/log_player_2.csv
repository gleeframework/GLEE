**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. While her message suggests the product might be worth more to her, there's no guarantee. Negotiating with Alice will take time and effort, and there's no assurance of a better price.  Buying from John immediately ensures you get the product within your budget without any hassle."
