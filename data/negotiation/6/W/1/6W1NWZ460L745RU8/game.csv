"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming closer to my budget, Alice. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $82.50 is still more than I had in mind. Could we do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can do $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, but I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",80.0,Alice,5,
