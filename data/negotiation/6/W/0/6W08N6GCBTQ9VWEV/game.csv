"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find common ground. ",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about $92? It's a small step towards meeting each other halfway. ",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $91. It's a small difference, but it would allow us to make a deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both getting close to an agreement.  $91 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $91.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will lead to a deal.",91.5,Alice,7,
