Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting higher, I have the potential to earn more.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is truly interested in the product, he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Negotiation room:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always lower the price slightly and make another offer. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for a higher profit."
