Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob, framing it as a ""great deal"" to increase his likelihood of accepting.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, but I have a fallback option with John if negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Counter:** I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation between $8,500 and my minimum.
* **Avoiding Settling:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit. I want to explore further negotiation before settling for a price below my desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $8,000.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer at $9,500, which is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $9,500, he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer, but I'm also signaling that I'm willing to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is much closer to my desired minimum of $12,000 than his previous offer.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price than I originally wanted.
* **Time is Money:** While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Bob won't budge much more. Accepting his offer now allows me to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
