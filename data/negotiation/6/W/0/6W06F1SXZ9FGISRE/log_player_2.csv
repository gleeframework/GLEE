{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  I can definitely do better. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $7,000.  This is well below Alice's value for the product, but it gives us a starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping she'll counter with something closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is sticking to her price, and I'm not happy with that. I'll try another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my target value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $8,500.  This is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot where we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's price is getting higher, but it's still significantly lower than John's price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to pay more than my previous offer, but still less than Alice's last one.  I'm hoping this is close enough to her price to seal the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's price is getting too close to John's offer. I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  I'll buy the product from John for $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's still within my budget, and I don't want to keep haggling with Alice."
