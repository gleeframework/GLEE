"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. I understand your perspective, but the $1,000,000 offer is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.
