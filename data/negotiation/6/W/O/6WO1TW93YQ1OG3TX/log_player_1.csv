{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's aim for a middle ground - how about $1,080,000? This price would allow us both to be happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,070,000 is a bit low for a product of this value.

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my goal, it's still not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  There's only a limited number of rounds left, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement that satisfies me.  Selling to John guarantees me the full value of the product."
