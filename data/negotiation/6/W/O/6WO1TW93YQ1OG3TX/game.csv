"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's aim for a middle ground - how about $1,080,000? This price would allow us both to be happy with the transaction.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
