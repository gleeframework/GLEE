"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation but still giving me a good profit.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a good profit. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired profit margin and it seems like we're nearing a deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely if we continue to negotiate."
