# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $119. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119.

Alice's offer of $119 is less than your maximum price of $120, and it's cheaper than buying from John for $120."
