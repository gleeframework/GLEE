"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $900,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $900,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
