Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $900,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At $950,000, Alice's offer is now below my walk-away price of $1,000,000 (John's offer).  Continuing to negotiate for a smaller potential gain isn't worth the risk of Alice pulling out or the deal falling through."
