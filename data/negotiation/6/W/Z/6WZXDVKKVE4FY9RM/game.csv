"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is tempting, but I need to get a little closer to my original price.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
