"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the substantial benefits you'll gain from it.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair value considering the product's worth and my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone with your vision, is truly exceptional.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,175,000 is still above my ideal price point. Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To be transparent, $1,050,000 is a bit too far from what I had in mind.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering the product's significant value to your business.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which shows my commitment to finding a solution. This price is a significant improvement from my previous offer and represents a fair value for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
