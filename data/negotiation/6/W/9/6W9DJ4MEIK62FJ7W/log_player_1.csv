{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $115 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially getting closer to your ideal price.
* **Avoiding John Immediately:**  While John's $120 offer is tempting, negotiating with Bob first could potentially lead to a higher price without relying solely on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can still try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit.  How about $110?  That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but not accepting it. I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly.
* **Fair Offer:**  $110 is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value, making it a potentially attractive option.
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:** I'm still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $107.50 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I can likely push him higher with a counteroffer.
* **John is a safe option:**  I can still fall back on selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $112.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **""Middle ground"" approach:** Suggesting $112.50 (the average of our two most recent offers) presents it as a compromise and a fair solution.
* **Building momentum:** If Bob accepts, I'll get a good price. If he rejects, we're likely to settle somewhere near $112.50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $109. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further concessions, potentially pushing the price below my minimum. 
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120, which is a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
