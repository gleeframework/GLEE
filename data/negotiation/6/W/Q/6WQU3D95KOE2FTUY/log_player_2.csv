"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives us room to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as you mentioned you value the product at $12,000.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While closer to my target, $11,500 is still more than I need to spend.  I'll politely decline and counter, aiming for a price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me. Would you consider $10,800? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 10800
}
``` 

I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show willingness, but still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving while trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,800 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200 as a final compromise.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line by calling it her ""final compromise.""  At $11,200, the price is good, saving me $800 compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
