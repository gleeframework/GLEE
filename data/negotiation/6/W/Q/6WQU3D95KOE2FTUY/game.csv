"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as you mentioned you value the product at $12,000.  Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me. Would you consider $10,800? That would work much better for me.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,800 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200 as a final compromise.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
