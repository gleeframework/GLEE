"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $125 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay under $100. Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $105? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
