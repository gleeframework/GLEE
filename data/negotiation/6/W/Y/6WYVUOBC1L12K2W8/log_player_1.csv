"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth, but I'm also leaving room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit shy of that. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm getting close to the point where I might just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of that price. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still hesitant.  We're in the final stages of negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, but if he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of that price. How about $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we've reached the final stages of negotiation.  I've made my final offer, and he's rejected it.  To avoid risking a lower price or wasting more time, I'm going to sell to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum acceptable price."
