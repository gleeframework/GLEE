"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit shy of that. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",132.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of that price. How about $130?",130.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to go with another buyer.",135.0,Alice,7,
