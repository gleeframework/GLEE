Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have time to negotiate.  Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to a price point that could be acceptable."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has signaled this is his highest price. It's a significant profit above John's offer, and waiting presents the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
