"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'll consider it, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would you be open to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Even though we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, I am willing to continue negotiating for a better price.  John is a safe option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob with a little more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good value for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in coming down in price. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still below my target. We have five rounds left, and I'm confident that I can get a better price with a little more negotiation. Selling to John would be safe, but I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob if I keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $8,900 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,050. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully. I'm willing to pay $8,850 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final three rounds, and Bob's offer of $8,850 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it is tempting to continue negotiating, I don't believe I can get a better offer from Bob within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of a lower final price."
