Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can push him higher.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance he'll increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however, to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price given the product's potential value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000, which is what the product is worth to Bob.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I don't want to settle for a sub-optimal price yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the significant value this product holds for you, I believe a price of $1,125,000 would be a fair reflection of its worth.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I see the value in this product, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,100,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I would like to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000,  I've only got 4 rounds left.  There's a risk that I won't be able to reach a better price, and I might end up selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's better to take the $1,100,000 now and secure a good deal."
