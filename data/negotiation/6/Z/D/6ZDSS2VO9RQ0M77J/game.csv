"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
