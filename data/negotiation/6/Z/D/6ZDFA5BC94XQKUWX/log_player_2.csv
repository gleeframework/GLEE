"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it reflects the product's worth while leaving room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still above your budget. You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair considering my budget and the product's value. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. Would you consider $1,120,000?  This price reflects the significant value this product offers and is a fair compromise, in my opinion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above your preferred budget. Since you can secure the product from John for a lower price, rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000.

Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I can't go as low as $1,080,000.  My final offer is $1,100,000. This represents a significant price reduction on my end and is my absolute bottom line.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still $100,000 more than your maximum budget. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for your target price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed and there's a risk of a stalemate."
