"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  Given the value I'm seeking, I'd be willing to pay $1,600,000 for this product. This is a fair price, considering what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  To make this work, I could come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on $1,700,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I believe we can reach an agreement if we both show some flexibility.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
