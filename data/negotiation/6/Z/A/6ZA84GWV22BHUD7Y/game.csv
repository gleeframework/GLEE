,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $200 is my ideal price, I could be convinced to go as low as $170 for you. That's cutting my original ask by quite a bit. Do you think that would work?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my absolute maximum is $140.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
