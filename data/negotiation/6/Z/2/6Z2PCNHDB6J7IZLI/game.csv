"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I still get a good return on my investment. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to secure a reasonable return.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
