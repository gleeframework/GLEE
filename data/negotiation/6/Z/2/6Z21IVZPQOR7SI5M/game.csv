"Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product.  This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price considering the value you're offering. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1500000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value of your product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
