"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the item you're selling. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $950000 for this product. Would you consider accepting this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the item. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the item, I am still unable to meet at $1100000. My maximum budget remains at $950000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $975000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Unfortunately, I am still unable to meet at $1050000. My maximum budget remains at $950000. I believe we've reached the limit of our negotiation here. I will now proceed to buy the product from John for $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
