"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This would still leave you with a healthy profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
