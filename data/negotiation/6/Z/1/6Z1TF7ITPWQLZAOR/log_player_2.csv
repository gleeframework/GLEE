You have three options:

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is my final offer.

Alice's final offer is $9,000. It's still more than what you're willing to pay, but it's less than buying from John. It's a good compromise and saves you some money."
