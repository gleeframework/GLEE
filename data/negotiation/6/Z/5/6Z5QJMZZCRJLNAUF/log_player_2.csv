**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product. Although John is selling for $12,000, Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
