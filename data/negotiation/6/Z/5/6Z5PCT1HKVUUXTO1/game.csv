"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my means.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recoup a good portion of my investment while also offering you a competitive deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the value of the product and allows me to cover my costs.  I believe it's a mutually beneficial deal that we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
