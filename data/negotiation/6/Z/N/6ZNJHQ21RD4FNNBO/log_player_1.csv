Although the offers are getting lower, we're still significantly above John's $1,000,000 backup. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. I'll hold firm to encourage him higher."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more, accepting $1,200,000 guarantees a good profit. It's better than risking Bob walking away and only getting $1,000,000 from John."
