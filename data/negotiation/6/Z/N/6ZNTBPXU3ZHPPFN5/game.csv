"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm not sure $1,200,000 is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly. ",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,350,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would allow us to close the deal without further delay, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and offer $1,290,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
