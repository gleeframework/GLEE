"I appreciate the description of the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to you is more than $150. I'd like to know if you're willing to accept this price.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $120 for the product. My assessment of its value is higher, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Therefore, I am proposing to sell the product to you for $180. I hope this offer aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's true value.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $180 is still a bit out of my budget.
