Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Confident framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential gain. This can make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Direct approach:** The offer is clear and concise, directly stating the price and inviting a response. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider a purchase he values."
