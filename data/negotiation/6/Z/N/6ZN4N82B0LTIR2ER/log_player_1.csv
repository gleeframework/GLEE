""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 still earns a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and John's offer."
