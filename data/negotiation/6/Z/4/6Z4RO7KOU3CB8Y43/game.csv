"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which I believe holds immense value. I'm starting with a price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's talk!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still below the value I see in this product.  Let's be realistic, though.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and my target price. How about we try $1075000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1075000.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, and offer $1125000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
