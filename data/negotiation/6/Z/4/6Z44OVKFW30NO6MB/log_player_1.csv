"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows Bob to feel like he can get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still showing flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is fair considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $10,500, $9,750 is a good price and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiations.  It's important to be flexible and ensure a deal is made, especially with a willing buyer like Bob."
