```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,900 is very close to your ideal price of $9,750.  You've only got 3 rounds left and there's a chance Alice won't budge further.  It's better to accept and secure the product at a price that's still within your budget than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
