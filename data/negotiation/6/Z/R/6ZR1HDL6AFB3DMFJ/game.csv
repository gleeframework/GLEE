"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase my product. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000, but I believe it's a valuable asset for your needs as well.  I'm confident it will bring you great value.  To start our negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm aiming to keep my budget under $1,200,000.  Let's start with $1,150,000.  I believe this is still a fair price, given the value you've described.  I'm open to further discussion.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation.  $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $1,225,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to stay below $1,200,000.  Let's try $1,175,000.  This is a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
