"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I can see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $145. That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,5,
