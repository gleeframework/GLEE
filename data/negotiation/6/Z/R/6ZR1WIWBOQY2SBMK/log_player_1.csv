"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive by stating this is the *only* price. I'm leaving room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or potentially even a better deal with John, if I continue negotiating. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with justification:**  I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, but providing a counteroffer with a reason. I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Moderate compromise:**  I'm coming down from $175, but still holding onto a price above my minimum. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  Again, I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not quite there. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm only a few rounds into the negotiation, and there's still time to increase the price. 
* **Avoid selling to John:** Selling to John at $150 would mean getting the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'd rather try to squeeze a little more out of Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I can see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $145. That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise by offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the ""fairness"" of the deal.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging, making Bob more likely to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiating rounds:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I'm concerned that I won't be able to reach a satisfactory price with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed deal:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement.  It's more advantageous than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting a lower price or failing to reach an agreement."
