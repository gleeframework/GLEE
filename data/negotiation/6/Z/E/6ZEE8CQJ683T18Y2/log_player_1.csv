Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate.  Bob might try to haggle, but you have a strong fallback position.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than $15,000, potentially encouraging Bob to accept without much negotiation."
