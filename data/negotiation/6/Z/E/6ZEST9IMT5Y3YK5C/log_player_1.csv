"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but staying above my minimum acceptable value. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm feeling the pressure, I'm still not ready to settle for Bob's offer.  It's too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm getting closer to considering John's offer as I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $825,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but I still want to ensure I get a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value.  It's getting late in the negotiations and I'm worried that I'm losing leverage. If Bob rejects this offer, I might be forced to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower. It's clear we're not going to reach an agreeable price, and I need to secure a sale. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm no longer confident that's possible.  John's offer is safe and guarantees me my minimum value."
