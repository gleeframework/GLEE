Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $4,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust your offer based on Bob's response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
