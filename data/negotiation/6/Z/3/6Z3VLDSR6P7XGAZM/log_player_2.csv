"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth at least $150.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $130 is above your maximum price of $100.
* **Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100. 

It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  We're aiming for a significant price drop right away.  Offering $90 is a bold move, but it shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for Alice to come down a bit from your offer, and it might encourage her to counter with something more reasonable. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $110 is still above your maximum price of $100.
* **Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $100. 

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, it's still not ideal.  You have the option to go with John and avoid any further negotiation, so it's worth seeing if you can get Alice even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $100.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is your maximum. It's important to show Alice that you are serious and have a clear limit.
* **Emphasis on Alternative:**  Reminding Alice that you have a guaranteed alternative at $100 strengthens your position.
* **Clear and Concise:** Keep the message short and to the point, focusing on the price."
