"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $110 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $109 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but how about we settle on $111?  That's closer to your offer, and it also gets me a little closer to where I need to be.",111.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that $108 is the sweet spot. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Can you accept $108?",108.0,Bob,6,
