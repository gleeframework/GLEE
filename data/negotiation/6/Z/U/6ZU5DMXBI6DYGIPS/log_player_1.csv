I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point to potentially maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value. I will reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but it's still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range. It's  higher than his initial offer and closer to my minimum value.  While selling to John would bring in more, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise and a faster transaction."
