"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'd be willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I believe this product is worth that to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $10,500 is significantly less than $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation is Limited:**  Alice is already willing to split the difference. Further negotiation may lead to a long process without significant gains. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  If Bob rejects again, Alice might become less willing to negotiate.

It's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
