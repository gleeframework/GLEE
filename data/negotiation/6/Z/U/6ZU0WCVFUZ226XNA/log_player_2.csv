"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. It's a starting point. You can try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my intention to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a better deal.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will give us a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my maximum, I'm still not willing to accept it yet.  I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $90. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a better price. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to an agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92.5 is getting very close to my maximum price of $100. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal, and there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away. At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice. I've saved $7.50, which is a good outcome considering my initial goal was to get the product for as low as possible."
