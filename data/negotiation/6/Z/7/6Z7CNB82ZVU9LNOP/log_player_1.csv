Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider?

}
``` 

While ideally, I'd want a price closer to $1,300,000, Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000. It's time to accept and secure the profit.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether."
