"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle at $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
