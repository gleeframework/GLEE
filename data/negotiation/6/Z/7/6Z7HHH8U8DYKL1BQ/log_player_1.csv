Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

At this point, $9,000 is a solid profit and it's better to secure the deal than risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
