"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $600,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $400,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal while allowing me to get a decent profit.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $550,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $450,000. Would that be workable?",450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $450,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $500,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal while allowing me to get a decent profit.",500000.0,Alice,5,
