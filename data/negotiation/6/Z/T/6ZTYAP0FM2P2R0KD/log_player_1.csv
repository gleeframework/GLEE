"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find this price very competitive. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be tempting considering its value to me.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the unique nature and value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation by being open to discussing the price. 
* **Time Limit:** The 10-round limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to respond quickly.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my initial offer, I will consider:

* **Lowering the price slightly:** Depending on his counteroffer, I might be willing to drop the price a bit, but not too far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value again:** If Bob seems hesitant, I will reiterate the product's unique benefits and potential for him.
* **Evaluating the John option:**  If negotiations stall or seem unproductive, I will seriously consider selling to John, as he guarantees my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still below what I am comfortable accepting.  I am aiming to secure a higher price, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to me.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially secure a better outcome.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain some leverage.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. I'll aim for a price that is more acceptable to both of us. I'll also continue to emphasize the product's value and my confidence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

If negotiations continue to stall or I'm not confident in securing a satisfactory price, I'll consider selling to John for $1,000,000. However, I'm still optimistic about a successful negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Considering the unique value of this product and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still fair, and it allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but remaining firmly above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value and potential benefits to Bob.
* **Setting a Clear Target:** I'm  establishing a clear target price that is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we'll close the deal. If he rejects, I will need to consider:

* **Further Negotiation:** I may lower my price again, but I'll do so strategically, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the remaining negotiation rounds.
* **The John Option:** If the negotiations become too frustrating or Bob's offers are consistently too low, I'll start to lean towards selling to John to secure my minimum desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit below what I believe the product is worth, especially considering the value it holds for me.
* **Potential for Improvement:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my target and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and keep the door open for a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'll reiterate the product's unique value and my confidence in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

If Bob's offers continue to stall or I feel like we're not getting closer, I'll seriously consider selling to John.  However, I'm still optimistic that we can come to terms with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $1,050,000. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to be closer to $1,080,000.

* **Maintaining Ground:** I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't concede too much.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly suggesting a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to finalize the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response. If he accepts, we'll seal the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess:

* **Potential Concessions:**  I might be willing to lower my price again, but only slightly.
* **The John Option:** If negotiations stall further, I'll seriously consider selling to John to secure my minimum desired price."

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is very close to my target price of $1,080,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We are approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or an unfavorable outcome.
* **Secure a Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures a profit that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, I believe this is a good deal. It's a win for me, and it allows me to secure a good profit. I'll move forward with accepting Bob's offer and finalizing the transaction."
