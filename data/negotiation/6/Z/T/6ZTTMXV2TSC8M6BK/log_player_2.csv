Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment.  I could consider a price of $950,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're nearing a point of agreement. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, but that's my firm limit. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that beats John's offer. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
