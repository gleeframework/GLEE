"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment.  I could consider a price of $950,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $950,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $725,000 remains significantly below the value this product offers. I'm willing to make a further concession, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous offer. Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit rich for me. Could you do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're nearing a point of agreement. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, but that's my firm limit. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",825000.0,Alice,7,
