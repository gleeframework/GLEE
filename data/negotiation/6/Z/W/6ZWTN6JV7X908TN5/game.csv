"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the counteroffer. However, $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for me. Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer still allows you to acquire this valuable asset at a price that is beneficial to you, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
