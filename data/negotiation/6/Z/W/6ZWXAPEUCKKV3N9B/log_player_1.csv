"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's previous offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, we're getting close to my minimum, and it's better to secure a sale than to risk another rejection and potentially have to sell to John for a lower price."
