Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm willing to come down a little to $135. This is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it. I'm still getting a good profit, and it's closer to what Bob offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $132 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly better than selling to John, and I'm confident I've gotten the best possible price from Bob."
