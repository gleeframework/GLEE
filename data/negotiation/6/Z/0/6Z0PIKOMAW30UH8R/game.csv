"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $13,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with the price going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go below $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the product. I think this is a great value, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
