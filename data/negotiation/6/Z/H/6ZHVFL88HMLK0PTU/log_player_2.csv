I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for Alice as it's more than half of what the product is worth to her. It also leaves some room for negotiation."

I'm offering $10,000. This is a compromise, and still a good deal for Alice given what the product is worth to her. If she rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
