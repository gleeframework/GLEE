"I appreciate your feedback, Bob. Considering your willingness to pay $1,050,000, I am prepared to accept a slightly lower price of $1,075,000 for the product. This offers a balance between meeting your budget and allowing us to sell the product at a satisfactory price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I believe it's a fair price given the value to me and the fact that I'm very close to my budget.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to reconsider my options.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
