Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still offers a potential discount compared to what I can get from John.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a ""limited time,"" I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to find a balance between securing a good deal with Bob and ensuring I don't miss out on selling the product for its minimum value to John."
