**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm on her price and is unlikely to go much lower. While getting it for $975,000 is a discount, it's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000.  Further haggling with Alice has a higher risk of ending in no deal and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
