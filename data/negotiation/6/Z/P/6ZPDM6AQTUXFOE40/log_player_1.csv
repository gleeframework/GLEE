"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for 3 rounds of potential counteroffers from Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have several rounds left and can likely secure a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's split the difference.  How about $12,750?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Time Factor:**  I'm emphasizing closing the deal quickly, which might nudge Bob towards accepting.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing this offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. However, based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $12000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the negotiation window is shrinking. 
* **Stalemate:** Bob seems firm on his $12,000 price, and I'm unlikely to get a higher offer from him.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $3,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a secure outcome with the remaining time constraint."
