"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $20,000 might have been a little high, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
