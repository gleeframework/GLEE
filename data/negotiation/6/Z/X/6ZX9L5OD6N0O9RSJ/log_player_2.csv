"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product! I'm willing to let you have it for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get the product from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $100 to John, but that's still within your budget and better than accepting Alice's offer."
