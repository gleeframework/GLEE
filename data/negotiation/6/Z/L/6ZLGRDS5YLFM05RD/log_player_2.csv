# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and this is a good deal for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price, but it could also risk Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
