I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm willing to risk losing a sale to John to try and get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm not convinced I can get him to budge much closer to my desired price.  While $1,500,000 is below my initial goal, it's still a good price and guarantees me a sale. It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
