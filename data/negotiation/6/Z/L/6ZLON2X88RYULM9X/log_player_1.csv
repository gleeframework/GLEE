{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to assess Bob's interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $90, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to get closer to that by making a counteroffer.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and meet at $110?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging on his offer of $90.  This is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that would be profitable for me.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees I don't lose money."
