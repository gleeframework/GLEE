Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll really love it! As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $6500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5500.

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $5750.

```

**Reasoning:**
