"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening that sets a strong baseline for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product. If he's not interested at this price, we can work our way down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go even higher. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a more aggressive counteroffer than the previous round. I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price and see if he's willing to close the deal.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, so I need to be strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's been a long negotiation, but I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose this sale."
