"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a premium price for this exceptional item. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $1400000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $1400000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1100000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
