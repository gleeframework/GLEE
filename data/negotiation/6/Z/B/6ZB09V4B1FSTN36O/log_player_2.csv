"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the price of $150. I think it's a great deal for its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This provides room to bargain upwards.
* **Significant Difference:** The initial offer of $150 is very high.  By countering with $60, we signal a serious interest in a lower price point while leaving space for Alice to counter. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $60 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $105 is still significantly higher than your $80 budget and closer to Alice's starting price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving from $150 to $105 shows a willingness to negotiate. There's a chance to bring the price down further. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The option to buy from John for $80 provides a safety net and leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $105 is closer, my budget really tops out at $70. Would that be workable?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** Increasing the offer to $70 demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price.
* **Budget Emphasis:** Re-iterating the $80 budget limit reinforces that there's a firm ceiling. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The tone remains polite and solution-oriented, hoping to find a price that works for both parties."
