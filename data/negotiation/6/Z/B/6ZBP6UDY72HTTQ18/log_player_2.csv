"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a clear alternative with John.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down in price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the [product name], but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to do $120?  I'm really hoping to find a deal, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and a good deal. Accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John."
