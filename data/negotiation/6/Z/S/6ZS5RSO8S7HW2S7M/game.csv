"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, the $800,000 offer is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this revised price presents a fair deal while still reflecting the significant benefits you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,800,000. This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to come down in price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
