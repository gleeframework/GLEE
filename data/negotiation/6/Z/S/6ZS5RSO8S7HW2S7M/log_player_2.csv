```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, the $800,000 offer is significantly below its true value and potential.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,800,000. This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice is still asking for too much.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap, but we are getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to come down in price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
