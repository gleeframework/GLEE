Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 rather than risk Alice not budging further."
