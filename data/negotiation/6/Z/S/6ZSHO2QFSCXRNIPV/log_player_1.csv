Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, creating a sense of win-win. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** $12,000 is a good starting point, allowing me to potentially earn a higher price.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A positive tone and the perception of mutual benefit might encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I haven't set a hard limit yet, leaving me free to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining control:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in the driver's seat and allows me to control the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise point with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him, highlighting the potential benefit of acquiring the product.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While lowering my price, I'm not giving in completely. This keeps some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget.  How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing John's offer:** Selling for $9,500 is a substantial loss compared to what John is offering.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us while still maximizing my profit.  I will also need to be mindful of the risk of losing John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,250 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize that $10,250 is a fair compromise that benefits both parties, potentially swaying Bob's decision.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While $10,250 is below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum than John's offer, making it a less risky option.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I have successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my desired range and avoided losing John's offer.
* If Bob rejects, I will need to re-evaluate the situation. I may need to make a final counteroffer or consider accepting John's offer to avoid further negotiation."
