"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget.  How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
