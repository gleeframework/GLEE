Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
This is the best deal you're likely to get from Alice, as you're now at $112.5, and she's already come down in price.  While you have more negotiation rounds, there's a risk she'll increase the price again or you'll reach a stalemate.  Buying from John for $120 would be more expensive.  Accepting the offer here is the most logical choice to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
