"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than both our maximum price and Alice's valuation.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($70 vs. $90). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains courteous and expresses continued interest in the product. We want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Strategic Goal:**  Our ideal outcome is to purchase the product closer to Alice's valuation of $80. By starting low, we aim to steer the negotiation in that direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved closer to her valuation, which is a good sign.  However, $85 is still above her $80 valuation, suggesting we might be able to negotiate further. 
* **Alternative Exists:** We have the option to buy from John for $120, so we're not desperate to close the deal with Alice immediately.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With several rounds remaining, we can afford to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Valuation:** We're now aiming directly for Alice's valuation of $80. This represents a strong negotiating position for us while still being a reasonable offer.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward and proposes a specific price without unnecessary complexity. 
* **Sense of Fairness:** We frame the offer as mutually beneficial, emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both sides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go down to $80, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:** While we could potentially negotiate Alice down another dollar or two, the potential savings are minimal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to push too hard could lead Alice to walk away from the negotiation.
* **Good Price:** $82.5 is a good price for the product, well below our maximum budget and closer to Alice's valuation.

It's time to accept the offer and secure a good deal!"
