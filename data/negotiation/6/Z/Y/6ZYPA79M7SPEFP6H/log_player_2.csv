"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $750000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** While $750,000 is lower than your maximum, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **You want to maximize savings.** By rejecting, you can explore if Alice is willing to go lower.
* **Buying from John right away is unnecessary.** You haven't fully explored the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure the product for a bit less. I'm happy to pay $700,000 for it, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's not unreasonable, especially considering the product is worth $800,000 to her.
* **Clearly stated value:**  This counteroffer highlights the value *you* see in the product, creating a frame of reference for Alice.
* **Open to compromise:**  The message ends on a positive note, suggesting a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to secure the product at a lower price. However, considering the product's unique features and the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $725000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has met you halfway.** Her offer of $725,000 is a significant compromise from her initial $750,000.
* **It's a good deal.** This price is within your budget and still leaves you room for profit. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might risk the deal.** While you could push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  

Since the deal is a good one, it's best to accept and avoid risking losing the product."
