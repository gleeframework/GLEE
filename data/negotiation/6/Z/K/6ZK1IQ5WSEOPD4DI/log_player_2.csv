"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to us, I'm proposing a price of $140 for it. I understand it's worth $120 to you, but I hope this price aligns well with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the initial offer allows him to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $140 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money, but he's also trying to find a middle ground. $125 is a reasonable compromise that still leaves some room for Alice to profit while being closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After considering our costs and the value we place on the product, I am able to offer it to you for $135. This is a slight adjustment from my previous proposal, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's target price, he is still trying to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to $120. He can always buy from John for $120 if the negotiations with Alice fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $135 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $130. This would be a good price for both of us, allowing me to get the product within my budget while giving you a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily lowering the price while still being respectful of Alice's position.  $130 is a good compromise, and Bob is confident that Alice might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After evaluating the situation further, I am willing to consider $132 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, allowing you to stay within your budget while ensuring a satisfactory return for us. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his goal of $120, and he has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate.  He's only $12 away from his target price, so rejecting the offer gives him a chance to see if Alice will budge even further.  He can still purchase from John for $120 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $132 is a great offer, and I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still just a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $128? I believe this is a fair price that would allow both of us to be satisfied with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is steadily getting closer to his target price.  By offering $128, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for Alice to make a profit.  He's also emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal, hoping to sway Alice."
