"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great price for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $850,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more in line with the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $875,000. How about we settle on $860,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $882,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",882500.0,Alice,5,
