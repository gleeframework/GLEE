"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think you'll find it incredibly useful. I'm asking for $110 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and a clear goal to save money. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's, but it's still within your acceptable range. This shows you're serious about buying but are willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $90 is a good starting point for negotiation. If Alice accepts, you save a significant amount. If she rejects, there's room for further counteroffers in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a fair starting point given its value, I could come down a bit. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While $100 is better than $110, it's still above your maximum price of $120. 
* **More room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.
* **You have an alternative:** Buying from John is still an option, but it's a less desirable outcome since it would cost you more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $100 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $95. I'm really looking to make this work, but that's the most I can do."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but moving closer:**  This offer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for a final deal:** $95 is still below Alice's offer, leaving room for her to make a final concession if she wants to close the deal. 
* **Maintaining your goal:** You're still aiming to stay below $100, which is crucial to meeting your goal of saving as much money as possible."
