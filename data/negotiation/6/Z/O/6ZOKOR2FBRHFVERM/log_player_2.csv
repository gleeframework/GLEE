"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500, which is halfway between Alice's minimum value ($10,000) and his own maximum value ($12,000). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better price, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether. It's a reasonable compromise to accept this offer."
