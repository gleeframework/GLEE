"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,5,
