"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a good deal for her, it's still significantly more than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I need to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000.

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's getting closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation. I'm getting a guaranteed price and saving myself the potential for further haggling."
