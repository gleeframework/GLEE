"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $850,000.  This is my best offer,  let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I can't justify going above $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your own profit margin. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
