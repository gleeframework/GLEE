"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product, and Alice's initial offer of $90 is close to that. However, you want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92.50 is still higher than your desired price point. You're willing to go up to $100 for the product, but you're trying to save as much as you can. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think $88.75 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $89.375? I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.38. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.38
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your price point:**  Alice's offer is $89.38, which is just a little over your counteroffer of $88.75. 
* **You're still saving money:**  This price is still below the $90 you were initially offered and well under the $100 you'd pay John. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject again, there's a chance Alice might become more firm and not budge further, leaving you with John's higher price. 

It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting now is a good way to secure a decent deal."
