"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,200,000 is considerably above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is considerably below my expectations for this sale.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers, and offer $1,500,000. This would give you a significant profit, while staying within my financial limits. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
