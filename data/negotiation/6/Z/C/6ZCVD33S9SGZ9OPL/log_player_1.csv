"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $150, I'd prefer to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. Bob's offers are getting lower and lower, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below my minimum. John is a safe bet, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with him later if I need to."
