"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. He's willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice's offer is still too high. He has room to negotiate a lower price and can leverage the threat of buying from John to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes the most sense to buy from John now. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob risks wasting time and potentially missing out on a better deal."
