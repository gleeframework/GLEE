Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I mention the value the product has to him, subtly suggesting that he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, so I've left some wiggle room in my initial price. 
* **Maintaining the John backup:**  I'm always aware of the backup option with John, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While his offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for improvement:** I have some room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John remains a viable option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000. 

**Next step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $850,000 but lower than $900,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low just yet. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This still offers you a significant value for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** My counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not dropping below $875,000 as this is still above Bob's perceived value, giving me some leverage.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.
* **Open to further discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for more negotiations by asking for his thoughts."
