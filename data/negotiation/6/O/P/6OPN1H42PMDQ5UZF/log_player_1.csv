Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** At $140, the product is still worth more to you than it is to Bob.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to go lower than your minimum value of $150, but not too low.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has some room to counteroffer without you losing too much money.

This strategy gives you a good chance of getting a price closer to your desired $150, while still leaving the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $150. Selling to John for $150 is a better option. However, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially negotiate a price closer to your desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It's still above Bob's preferred price but below your minimum, showing you're willing to negotiate. It also emphasizes the value the product offers, making the price more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've been able to find another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for $120. Thank you for considering my budget, but I believe this other offer aligns better with my current financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob has found another seller offering the same product for his desired price.  This means further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful. Given that John is willing to buy the product for $150, which is well above your minimum and a better deal than Bob's offer, it makes more sense to sell to John."
