Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than what I would accept from John, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay this price. This strategy gives me a good starting point, and allows for potential for a higher final sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating my desire to close the deal. This counteroffer should keep Bob engaged in the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price, and while it's still not ideal, it's a better deal than selling to John. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but there is also a risk of Bob walking away entirely.  The potential loss from further negotiation is greater than the potential gain, so it's best to accept this offer and close the deal."
