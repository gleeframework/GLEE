{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safe $1,000,000, Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) allows for a much higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a significant profit for Bob ($100,000) while securing a substantial gain for you ($400,000) over John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more inclined to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
