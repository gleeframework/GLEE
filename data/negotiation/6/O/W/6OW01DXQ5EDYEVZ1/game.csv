"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer!  While I see the value in your product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $1,050,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make a deal here, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. This is a good compromise and gives you a great opportunity to invest in this product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
