"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know what you think!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $1,050,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to make a deal here, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. This is a good compromise and gives you a great opportunity to invest in this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below John's price in the remaining rounds. John's offer of $1,200,000 is the best deal available, and it's within your budget. It makes more sense to secure that deal now than risk further negotiation with Alice."
