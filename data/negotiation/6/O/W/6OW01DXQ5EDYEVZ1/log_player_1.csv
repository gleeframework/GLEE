Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer!  While I see the value in your product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I need to make. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before I go with John."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $1,050,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make a deal here, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,175,000 is getting closer to what I need, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal from Bob before I go with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. This is a good compromise and gives you a great opportunity to invest in this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
