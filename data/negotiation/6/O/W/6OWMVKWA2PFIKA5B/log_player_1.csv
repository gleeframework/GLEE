Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to settle for less than $11,000 unless Bob negotiates well."
