Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is readily offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on a potential $50,000 profit. It's strategically better to secure the guaranteed offer from John."
