# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the upper end of its value, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
