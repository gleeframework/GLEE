"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This offer is slightly above halfway between my maximum price and her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly, but she's still above my alternative option of buying from John for $8,000. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,750?"",
 ""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between our last two offers. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing firm on getting a good deal. It's still above my fallback option of John, but allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my bottom line! There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John, as they both offer the same price now. I'll accept Alice's offer."
