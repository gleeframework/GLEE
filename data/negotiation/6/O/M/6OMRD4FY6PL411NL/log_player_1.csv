Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Is below Bob's valuation:**  $14,000 is below Bob's valuation of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **Is reasonable:**  It's a realistic starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for both parties to potentially find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still slightly lower than your minimum.  It's better to reject the offer and try to get closer to your desired price range. Since you know John is willing to pay $12,000, you have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly the same amount John is willing to pay.  Since you are guaranteed to sell to John for this amount, there's no incentive to continue negotiations with Bob.  There's no chance of getting a better price, and you risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
