# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

While $9,250 is closer to your limit, you're still not quite at the price you're comfortable with. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze out a little more from Alice before going with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you consider $9,100?  It's a small difference, and it would help me make a fair profit.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100

While $9,100 is close to your limit, it's still above what you're comfortable spending. At this point, it's better to stick to your original goal and buy from John for $8,000."
