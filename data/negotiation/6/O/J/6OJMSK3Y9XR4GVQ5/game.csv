"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you consider $9,100?  It's a small difference, and it would help me make a fair profit.  Let's get this deal done!",9100.0,Alice,5,
