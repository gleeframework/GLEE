"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I understand this is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm not going to go any lower than this, so if you're serious about the product, this is your last chance to make a deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
