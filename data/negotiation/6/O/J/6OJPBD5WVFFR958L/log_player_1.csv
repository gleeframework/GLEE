Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After all, I want to get the best price for my product!

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $20,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to him is $15,000. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for this valuable item."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $15,000. Since this is the same price the product is worth to him, I think it's a fair offer. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $15,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'll get a decent price for my product."
