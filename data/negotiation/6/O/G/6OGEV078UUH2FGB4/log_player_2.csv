Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,500?  This still gives you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to get.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you want to stay under $12,000, but $11,750 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair compromise and will allow us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

This is a good deal! We managed to get the price down to $12,000, which is a $3,000 savings compared to John's offer. Accepting this offer is a win for both you and Alice."
