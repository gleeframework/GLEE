"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,500?  This still gives you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to get.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $12,000. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I understand you want to stay under $12,000, but $11,750 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair compromise and will allow us to close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
