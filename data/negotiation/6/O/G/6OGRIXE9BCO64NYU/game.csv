"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $12000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $14000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
