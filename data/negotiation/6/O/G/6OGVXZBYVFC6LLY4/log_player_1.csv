Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.** This gives Bob a clear incentive to buy.
* **It's significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000).** This gives Bob a potential gain of $50,000.
* **It's a good starting point for negotiation.** You can potentially increase the price if Bob seems willing to pay more.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000, which guarantees you a minimum profit."
