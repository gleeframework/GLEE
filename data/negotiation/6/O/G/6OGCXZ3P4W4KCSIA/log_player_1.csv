""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's something that could be very valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $9,500, you are aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation while still securing a significant profit margin. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than what John is offering."
