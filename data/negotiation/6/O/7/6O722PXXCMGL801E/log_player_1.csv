"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than the value to Bob, but still above my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully encourages Bob to accept quickly.  However, I'm prepared to hold firm on my price if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $13,800, but that's really my bottom line.  This product is worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 13800}
``` 
I'm aiming for a price that's a good compromise, still leaving some room for further negotiation, but getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,500 is closer to my desired value than selling to John for $12,000. It's also a good compromise considering we're halfway through our rounds. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
