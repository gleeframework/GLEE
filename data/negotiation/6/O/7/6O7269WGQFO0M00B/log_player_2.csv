"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still above your desired price point. You can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,250 is a good compromise. It's below your initial target of $7,000, but still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying $8,000 to John.  Accepting this offer saves you $750 compared to buying from John."
