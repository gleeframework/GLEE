Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. Would you consider meeting me at $90?

It's unlikely Alice will go below $90, and we have a guaranteed option at $80.  It's time to cut the negotiation short and go with John."
