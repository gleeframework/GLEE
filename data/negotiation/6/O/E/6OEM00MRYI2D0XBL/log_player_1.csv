Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob values the product more than you do, encouraging him to consider a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I believe I can push for a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still maintaining a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and closer to my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still believe the product is worth more than $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, but he's shown a reluctance to go higher.  At this point, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
