{""product_price"": 900000}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. I'm going to raise my offer again to $950,000. This is still below my ideal price, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and come closer to Alice's position.  I believe that this is a reasonable offer that Alice might be willing to accept."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's time to make a more substantial counteroffer. I'm raising my bid to $975,000, which is still within my budget and close to Alice's offer.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that shows I'm serious about closing the deal."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  With only one round left, I'm unlikely to get a better deal from Alice.  It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point, as it's within my budget and ensures I get the product."
