Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (John's price), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us negotiation room.
    * It's still a substantial discount from John's offer, incentivizing Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
