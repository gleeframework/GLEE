Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 again, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a consulting contract for a year. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.
