"Round 1

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $962,500.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500.
