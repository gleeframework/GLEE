Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is strategic. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. This makes Bob feel more in control and potentially more open to a deal.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. It allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob."
