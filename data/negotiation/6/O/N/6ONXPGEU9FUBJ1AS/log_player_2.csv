"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's well above your maximum price point of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer,  $110, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.  It's also important to keep in mind that John is offering the product for $120, so I need to stay below that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will continue to negotiate in hopes of getting a lower price.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup option and willing to sell for $120, so I need to stay below that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $125.  This is still below my maximum price point of $120, but it shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is selling for $120, so I need to stay below that price to make this a worthwhile deal."
