"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and is a fair starting point for us to work towards a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,150,000, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I believe the product's value is still worth more than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This shows a genuine effort to compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $1,100,000. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would put the price at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
