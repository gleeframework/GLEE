"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in my best interest to reject and counteroffer to start negotiating a price that's more reasonable."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,625,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,625,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably spend. Let's try $1,250,000. This reflects a significant concession from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in this product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we both see the value in this product. How about we split the difference and land at $1,437,500?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,437,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,437,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price closer to my limit.  I'm also still considering buying from John, as his price is significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant jump for me, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  I'm confident we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this out - how about $1,375,000? It's a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though we're getting closer.  With only a few rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees a deal within my budget and saves me the time and potential risk of further negotiations."
