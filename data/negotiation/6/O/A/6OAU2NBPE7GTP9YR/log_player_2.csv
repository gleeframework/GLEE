"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've expressed interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,200,000).  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $300,000."
