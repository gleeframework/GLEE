Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $20,000 doesn't mean this is the final price. Bob might negotiate, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Confident but not greedy:** While aiming high, the message avoids appearing overly aggressive or unrealistic. It emphasizes the product's value while acknowledging Bob's potential interest. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
