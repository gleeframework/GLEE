"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
