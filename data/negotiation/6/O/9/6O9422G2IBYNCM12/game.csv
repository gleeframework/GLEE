"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a healthy profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
