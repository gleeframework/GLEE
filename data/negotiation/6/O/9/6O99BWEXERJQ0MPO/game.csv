"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still represents a fair value for the product and its benefits to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a solid profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product's worth to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $890,000. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $915,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product's worth to you.",915000.0,Alice,7,
