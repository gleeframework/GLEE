"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which is a competitive offer considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. Since you have 10 rounds, there's plenty of room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still represents a fair value for the product and its benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still above your ideal price. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a solid profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still too high. You have several rounds remaining, and it's worth pushing for a lower price.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a deal closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $890,000. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $915,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is getting closer to your ideal price point. You're likely not going to get a significantly better deal by continuing to negotiate. Given the limited number of rounds remaining (3), it's more advantageous to accept the offer and avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice or having to pay the higher price from John."
