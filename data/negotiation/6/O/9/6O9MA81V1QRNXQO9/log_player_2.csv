"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair for both parties. Offering $105 is a reasonable compromise, as it is closer to Alice's valuation of $100 and still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $120. While Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee he'll be successful, and the risk of losing the deal to John is present. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
