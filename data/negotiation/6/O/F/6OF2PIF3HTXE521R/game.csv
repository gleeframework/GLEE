"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued negotiation.  $14,000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to go to $12,000. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful you'll see the value in closing this deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
