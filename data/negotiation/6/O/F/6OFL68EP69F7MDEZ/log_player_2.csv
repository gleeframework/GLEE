Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of selling the product for $10,500. What do you think?

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still willing to push for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get her closer to $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit away from $9,750, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $10,250. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or missing out altogether. I'll take the guaranteed offer from John for $10,000."
