Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.

$11,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. You want to try to negotiate further."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

While $10,500 is closer to your target, it's still above your budget and you've already had a few rounds of negotiation. To save time and ensure you stay within your budget, it's best to buy the product from John for $8,000."
