"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $120 to you. Our initial offer is $110. We're confident you'll find this deal attractive and hope to hear back from you soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a decent discount from John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to create room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  He provides a reason for the lower offer, emphasizing his interest in the product while making a case for a lower price.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $95 is still above Alice's value of $80, leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to offer the product for $100. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair deal for us. Looking forward to your feedback! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is within Bob's budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $100 is below Bob's maximum price of $120, making it a worthwhile purchase.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or further lowering Alice's willingness to negotiate is present.
* **Opportunity to save:** Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $20 compared to buying from John.

This decision balances the desire for a lower price with the risk of losing the deal or facing a less favorable counteroffer in the future."
