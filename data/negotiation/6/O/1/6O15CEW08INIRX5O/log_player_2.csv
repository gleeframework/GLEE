"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth $140 to you, considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know we can potentially get a better price, either from Alice through negotiation or from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This achieves a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counter-offer lets us quickly understand if Alice is willing to negotiate or is fixed on a price close to her initial offer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to move upwards in price over subsequent rounds. 
* **Stays below our alternative:** Our counteroffer keeps us well below the $150 we could spend with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Alice is negotiating:** Her counter-offer shows she's willing to move on price. 
* **Room for improvement:**  We're still $10 away from her product valuation ($120) and $20 away from our maximum budget. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While we have several rounds left, we don't want to drag this out unnecessarily and risk Alice becoming less flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic move:** Offering $120 is significant because we know this is Alice's product valuation. It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Fair negotiation:** We've moved up in price, showing we're serious about buying and meeting her halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Alternative in mind:**  We still have the option of John's $150 offer if Alice completely rejects any offer around $120."
