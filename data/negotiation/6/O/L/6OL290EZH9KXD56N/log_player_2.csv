"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a special price. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $1,200,000, which is a discount of $300,000. However, I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, which is the maximum amount I am willing to pay. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
