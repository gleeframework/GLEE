Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John, she has leverage to start high. 
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number. It uses language like ""value"" and ""benefits"" to frame the price as justified.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This is important because it can prevent an immediate rejection and keep the conversation going. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible strategy.  Alice could choose to start lower or higher depending on her risk tolerance and how much she wants to prioritize a quick sale. 
* A successful negotiation requires understanding the other party's needs and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
