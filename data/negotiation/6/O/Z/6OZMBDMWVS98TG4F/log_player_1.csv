"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential"" aims to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", we invite Bob's input and open the door for counteroffers.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His reaction will reveal how eager he is to buy.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** We're aiming for the upper end of the possible price range.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** We can always adjust our price in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately met my minimum acceptable price, which is a strong signal he might be willing to go higher. Accepting $1,200,000 now would leave potential profit on the table. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show some flexibility but still aim high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This presents a classic negotiation tactic, suggesting fairness and compromise. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While we're moving closer to Bob's offer, $1,400,000 is still significantly above his initial bid and allows for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how much he's truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. However, the increase is relatively small. By rejecting and countering, I signal that I value the product higher and encourage him to make a more significant jump. I'm still above my minimum, so there's room to maneuver."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, let's settle on $1,325,000. This reflects a significant concession from my initial ask."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a noticeable price drop of $75,000 to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and encourage Bob to respond in kind.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning the ""significant concession,"" I remind Bob of the initial price difference, framing this offer as a good deal.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  This price is still comfortably above Bob's initial offer and my minimum, leaving room for a final agreement somewhere in between."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now anchoring his offer at $1,250,000 and using the ""meeting halfway"" tactic. This suggests he might be getting close to his maximum price. While I'm tempted to accept as it's above my minimum, there are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can push him a bit further. I'll hold firm on my price this round to gauge his reaction and willingness to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant decision, and I want to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to stand firm at $1,325,000. This price accurately reflects the value and potential this product holds. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** By repeating my previous offer, I signal that I'm serious about the price and not willing to go lower easily. This can create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Reiterating Value:** I want to remind Bob of the product's worth, subtly suggesting that my price is justified and he's getting a good deal.
* **Direct Approach:** Asking ""What do you say?"" prompts a clear response from Bob and encourages him to make a decision or a stronger counteroffer. 

At this point, I'm aiming to either close the deal near my desired price or gain more insight into Bob's true willingness to pay."
