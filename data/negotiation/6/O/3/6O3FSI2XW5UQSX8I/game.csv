"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth less than $1,500,000 to you. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was looking for.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  I'm happy to close the deal at this price, but I'm also willing to walk away and consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,325,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
