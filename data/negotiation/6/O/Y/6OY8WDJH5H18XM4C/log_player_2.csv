"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for something worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you say?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $130 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120.  This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $120. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk not getting the product at all."
