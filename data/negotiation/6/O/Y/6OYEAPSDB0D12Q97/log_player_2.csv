"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a low offer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it gives Bob a chance to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, and Bob can still negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a price closer to his goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to split the difference between his previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's offer of $10,500. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to save as much as possible.  It's likely Alice will either accept this offer or counter with a slightly higher price, making a deal possible."
