"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value it brings to you and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
