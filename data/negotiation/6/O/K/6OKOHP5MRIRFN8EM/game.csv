"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",11000.0,Bob,4,
