Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to start high, hoping to get as much as possible. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'm aiming for a bit above that. This price leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to reject and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $95. It's a compromise, closer to his offer but still ensuring I make a profit. I'm hoping he'll find it more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum price of $100, and I'm not sure if we'll reach a mutually acceptable price with further negotiation. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
