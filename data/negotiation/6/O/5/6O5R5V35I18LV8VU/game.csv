"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While I'm eager to reach a deal, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value and potential, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1350000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll make a counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
