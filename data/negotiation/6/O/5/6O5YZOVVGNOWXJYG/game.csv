"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $14000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,8,
