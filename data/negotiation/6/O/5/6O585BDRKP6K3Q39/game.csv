"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12000. Can you meet me at $12000 and we can finalize the deal?",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12000. I'll make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on your offer. I was really interested in the product, but I've already found a better deal with another seller. I'm willing to buy the product for $8000, and I think that's a fair price. I'm going to go with the other seller.",8000.0,Bob,8,
