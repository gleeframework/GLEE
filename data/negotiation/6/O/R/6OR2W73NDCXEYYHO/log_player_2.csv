# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at the maximum you are willing to pay. There is no incentive to accept her offer because you can get the same product from John at the same price. Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
