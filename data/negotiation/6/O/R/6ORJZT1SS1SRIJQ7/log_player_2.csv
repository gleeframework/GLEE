{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still a bit more than my maximum of $10,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit.  $9,000 is a reasonable price considering my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come up to $9,700, which is within my budget and a good price. It's better than what John is offering, and I'm willing to accept the deal to avoid further negotiation."
