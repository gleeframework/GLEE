"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's still a substantial profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value and is a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a little higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a strong price that's fair to both of us, allowing for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
