"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The price is not too aggressive, so Bob is likely to make a counteroffer, allowing us to continue the negotiation. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option with John, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would you be willing to lower the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $10,000. I value the product at $12,000, and I have a guaranteed sale with John for that amount. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a certain budget. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I can't go lower. This is a great price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by a huge amount. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Setting a firm limit:** I'm making it clear that $11,000 is my bottom line. 
* **Keeping John as backup:** I'm still aware that selling to John is a safe option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,800 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000 yet, especially with John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer to see if he's willing to budge further. This keeps the negotiation going and gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,800 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $11,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll agree it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I'm presenting it as a fair compromise to meet in the middle. 
* **Maintaining value focus:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for the product's value.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still aware that selling to John is a safe option, but I'm willing to see if Bob will come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering the value of your product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is finally within my acceptable range. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it.  There's a good chance that further negotiations won't result in a significantly higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. 

I'm also taking into consideration that I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which gives me a safety net.  Accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise and allows me to secure a sale quickly."
