"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is above Bob's perceived value but not excessively high. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to hearing his thoughts, inviting counteroffers and starting the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Although I could sell to John for $100, I'm still in a stronger position with Bob. He's expressed interest, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer is the next step:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $105 is above Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I express appreciation for Bob's offer and emphasize wanting to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Show flexibility:**  The message conveys that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firm on the price being above $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiations are stalling:**  Bob's offers are not getting any closer to my desired price. It's starting to feel like a lengthy process with no guarantee of success.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiations. It's the most secure and profitable choice at this point."
