Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested.  We're making progress in narrowing the gap, and it's worth pushing a little further to see how high we can go."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now presented the same offer twice and called it his ""final offer."" While we could continue negotiating, there's a real risk he'll walk away. Accepting $875,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
