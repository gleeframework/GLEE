"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get closer to Alice's $8,000 valuation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue negotiating. While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for improvement. Bob should aim for a price closer to $10,000 or even lower."
