"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $100. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
