"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
