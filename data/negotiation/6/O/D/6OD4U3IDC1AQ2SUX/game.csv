"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely to be much higher.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1600000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1700000, which is a strong offer considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal, I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
