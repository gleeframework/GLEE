Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.
