{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $110, which is higher than what it's worth to Bob but still potentially appealing given the value he places on it. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to try and get Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest in the product. By starting high, I can gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his response.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary, ensuring I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.

**Strategy:**

I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still acknowledging Bob's interest. If he continues to refuse, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100 to ensure I make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $105 for the product. This is a fair price considering its quality and value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $105, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my value. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a tactic of gradually lowering my price while still leaving room for negotiation. This approach shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm impressed with his persistence and willingness to negotiate,  I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $100, which guarantees I'll make a profit. 

**Strategy:**

This decision is based on a combination of factors:

* **Minimizing risk:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag the process out, potentially leading to a lower price or even no deal at all.
* **Profit priority:** While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, securing a sale at $100 is a better outcome than risking a lower offer or a failed negotiation."
