"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get. 
* This strategy aims to gauge Bob's initial interest and potentially secure a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $9,000 is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than my minimum.
*  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This shows flexibility but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's position while emphasizing the value he'll get and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $10,000 is closer to my minimum of $8,000, but still a good deal.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 4, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.
* **Risk assessment:**  While I could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Bob will be willing to go higher, and the possibility of having to sell to John at $8,000 becomes a real threat.
* **Profit:**  Selling to Bob at $10,000 is still a good profit, and I'm confident that I can find another product to sell to John later.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical decision. It's a good deal, and it minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
