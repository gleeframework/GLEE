"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a great return on my investment.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget for this purchase. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I need to make a bit more than that to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting a top-notch product at a price that's still below its true value.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about we say $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
