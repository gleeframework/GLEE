Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves a potential $100,000 for Bob to negotiate down, while still netting Alice a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  The message is designed to be open-ended and encourage a dialogue. This will help Alice understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to meet her near her desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $1,300,000. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, Alice knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. She has room to negotiate further before considering John's offer.  Rejecting Bob's offer now keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you have budget constraints.  I'm still confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth a significant return for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By splitting the difference, she maintains a strong position while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Alice reiterates the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a price above his initial offer."
