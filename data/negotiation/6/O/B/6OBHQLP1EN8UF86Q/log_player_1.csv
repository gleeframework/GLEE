Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,012,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $995,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we're within striking distance of an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000

While it's tempting to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $995,000 is a strong one. It's significantly higher than John's offer and keeps a good profit margin. Holding out for more risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
