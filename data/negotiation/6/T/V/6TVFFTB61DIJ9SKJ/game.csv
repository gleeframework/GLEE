"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
