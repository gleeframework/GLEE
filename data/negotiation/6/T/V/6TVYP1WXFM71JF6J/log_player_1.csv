Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation, and is also less than Bob's maximum price, making it potentially attractive to him.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but there's still room to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I believe $1,150,000 is still a fair price considering the value to Bob. It's a good compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counter again to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at this point. $1,100,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call! While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price, Bob seems hesitant to go higher.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale, I'll go with John's offer.  It's still a good deal and secures a solid profit."
