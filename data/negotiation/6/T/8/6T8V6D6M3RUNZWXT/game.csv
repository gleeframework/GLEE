"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $100 is my absolute bottom line.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $100 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $90 for the product,  and hopefully we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
