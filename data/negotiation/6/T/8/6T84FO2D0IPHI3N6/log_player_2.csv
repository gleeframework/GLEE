Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can work something out.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows you to make a good investment. If you're serious about making a deal, let's meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,000,000, it's in your best interest to take that deal and maximize your savings."
