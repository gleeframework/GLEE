{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than $1,000,000. I'm also leaving the door open for a counteroffer from Bob, giving him the opportunity to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
