Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""steal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can get at least $1,000,000 for the product if Bob doesn't agree.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's shown interest and acknowledged the product's value. There's still room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, which gives me leverage.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value or, if unsuccessful, fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Positive language:** I use phrases like ""great deal"" and ""make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage agreement.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Final offer:**  Bob's message emphasizes that this is his final offer. While I could counteroffer again, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price are slim.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's final offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can secure a higher price by selling to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't go any lower than $800,000. This is still a very good price for you, considering the product's value. If you're serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to meet you at this price. However, if you're not willing to budge, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  "", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter:** This is my final counter-offer, showcasing that I'm serious about selling to Bob but only at a price that's closer to my perceived value.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning that I'll move on to another buyer if he doesn't accept.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's final offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still securing a good price.

This strategy aims to get Bob to accept my final offer. If he rejects it, I'll proceed to sell the product to John."
