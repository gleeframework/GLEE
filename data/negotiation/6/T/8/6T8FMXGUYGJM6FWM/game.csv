"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't go any lower than $800,000. This is still a very good price for you, considering the product's value. If you're serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to meet you at this price. However, if you're not willing to budge, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  ",800000.0,Alice,5,
