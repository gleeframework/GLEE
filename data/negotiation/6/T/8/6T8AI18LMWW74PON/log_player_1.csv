Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay more than he originally thought, and it also gives me some space to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still too low. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long, drawn-out process. John is already willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee a reasonable profit."
