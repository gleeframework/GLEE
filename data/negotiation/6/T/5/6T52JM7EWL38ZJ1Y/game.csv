"Alice, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $13,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
