"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 Alice's starting price is a bit high. There's room to negotiate a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  We start by offering $105. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a decent profit margin for her ($5). 
* **Polite and Engaging:** The message is friendly and shows we're serious about buying but want a fair deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows space for Alice to counter back, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to a price we're happy with, but we still have some room to maneuver. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can get closer to $100 before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we settle on $110? That seems like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer proposes meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($115) and our previous offer ($105).  This shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is straightforward, highlighting the compromise and framing it as a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Nearing the Decision Point:** We're getting close to our maximum budget.  We may need to accept if Alice doesn't budge much from this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob! I can do $112, but I don't think I can go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $112 is a reasonable price, saving us $38 compared to John's offer. 
* **Alice's Limit:** Alice indicated this is likely her lowest price.  Further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to haggle over a few dollars might not be worth the time and effort."
