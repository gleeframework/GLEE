Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm ready to negotiate with Bob, but I also have a guaranteed alternative with John. This gives me leverage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable value. It's worth exploring further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer, hopefully securing a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a competitive rate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes fairness, highlighting the value Bob will get for the product. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the deal. 
* **Leverage:** Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering the price even further, potentially leading to a deal below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:** While I'd like to get a higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing a deal that already guarantees a significant profit."
