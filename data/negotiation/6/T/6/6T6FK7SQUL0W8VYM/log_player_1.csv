Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than to you.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you a negotiating advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation creates a win-win situation.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit for you (over 40% above your minimum) while still saving Bob $50,000 compared to his valuation.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""pleased to offer,"" ""significant value,"" and ""worthwhile investment"" frame the offer positively.
* **No Mention of Other Buyers:**  Keeping John as a backup option strengthens your position.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could experiment with slightly lower prices to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, but be cautious about going too low and missing out on potential profit."
