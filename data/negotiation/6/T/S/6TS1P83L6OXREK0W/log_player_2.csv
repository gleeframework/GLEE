{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to John's price.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's getting more time-consuming and potentially less profitable. It's best to take the sure thing with John and purchase the product for $1,000,000."
