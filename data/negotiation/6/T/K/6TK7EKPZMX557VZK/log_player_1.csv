I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide if his next offer is good enough, or if I should sell to John and guarantee a $1,000,000 profit."

I'm still holding out for a better deal, especially with only 4 rounds left. I'm confident that I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation, as Bob still has a higher valuation than my floor price. I'll counter again."
