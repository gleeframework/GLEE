{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a [briefly describe the product] and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting potential value for Bob to pique his interest.  
* **Open-Ended:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** Starting high allows me to potentially secure a higher selling price.
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm gauging Bob's interest level and his potential budget.
* **Prepared to Negotiate:**  I'm prepared to lower the price if needed, but I'll start by aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying the product for $12000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.** Selling for $12,000 would be a loss for me. 
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I don't lose money.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially finding a middle ground. 

I will now counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also protecting my interests.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Clear and Direct:**  I'm being clear about my expectations and leaving the decision in Bob's hands.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value, minimizing my risk of losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John for $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:**  Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum acceptable value.  
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for the same price, there's no benefit in continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer avoids further back-and-forth, potentially wasting time that could be spent on other opportunities.

This decision ensures I get my minimum desired price while avoiding unnecessary delays."
