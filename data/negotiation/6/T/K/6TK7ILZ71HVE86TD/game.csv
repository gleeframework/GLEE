"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
