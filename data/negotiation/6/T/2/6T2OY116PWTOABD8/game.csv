"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a reasonable margin, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",975000.0,Bob,6,
