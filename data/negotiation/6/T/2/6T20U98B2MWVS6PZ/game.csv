"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I could go up to $75, but that's really the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $75 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $80.  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
