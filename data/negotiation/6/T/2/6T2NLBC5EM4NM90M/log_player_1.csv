Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $90.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and hopefully get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $75? It's still a good deal for you, and closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $65, Alice.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $70 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and above my minimum value of $80. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer completely if I continue to reject his offers.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
