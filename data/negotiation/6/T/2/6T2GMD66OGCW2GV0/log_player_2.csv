{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, there's room to negotiate and save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $800,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a good price. This offer is still well below Alice's previous offer and closer to my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now within my acceptable range and represents a significant discount from her initial price and a good deal for me.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will either reject my counteroffers or become unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of continuing negotiations."
