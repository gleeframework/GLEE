"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. If Alice rejects, you can always fall back to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $850,000, which is still a good profit for Alice ($50,000 above her valuation).  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise while still saving me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to my desired price point.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price while saving $100,000 compared to John's offer."
