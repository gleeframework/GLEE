,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while your product is interesting, $1000000 is significantly below my initial assessment. I'm willing to offer you $750000 for it. This represents a fair compromise and allows for a smooth transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Given the unique potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm offering $800000. This represents a significant step towards a fair agreement.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
