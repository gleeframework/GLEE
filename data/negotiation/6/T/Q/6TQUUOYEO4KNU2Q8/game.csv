"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This represents a considerable compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's the best price we can reach.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be flexible, and I appreciate your offers so far.  However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price given our individual positions.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best price we can reach.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
