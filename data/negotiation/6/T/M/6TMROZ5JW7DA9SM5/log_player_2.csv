Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $140 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. How about we try $130? It's a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $120. At this point, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
