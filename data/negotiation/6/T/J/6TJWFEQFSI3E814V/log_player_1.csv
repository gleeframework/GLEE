"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,250? That leaves a little room for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my target.  I'm willing to risk one more round to try and get closer to $8,000.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us.  I can't go lower than $8,000.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
