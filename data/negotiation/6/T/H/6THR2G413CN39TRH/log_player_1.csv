Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob might negotiate or reject the offer. You have the security of John's offer if needed."
