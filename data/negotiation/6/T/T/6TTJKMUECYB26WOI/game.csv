"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and can bring significant value to your business.  My starting price is $1,300,000, which is still well below what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000,  which reflects both the value of the product and your  interest in acquiring it. Let's find a middle ground so we can both be satisfied with the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
