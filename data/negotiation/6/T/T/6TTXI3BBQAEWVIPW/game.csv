"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $110.  Would you consider $135? It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll be happy with.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
