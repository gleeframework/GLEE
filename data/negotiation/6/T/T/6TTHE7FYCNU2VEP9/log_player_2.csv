"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored just for you. Given its high value to you at $120, I propose we make this transaction special. How about we agree on a price of $100? This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
