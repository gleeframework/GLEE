Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between assertiveness and openness to negotiation, giving me the best chance to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! It sounds like a great product.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to sell it for that amount right away.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counteroffer of $90, which is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the fairness of the counteroffer, highlighting that it provides a good deal for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and positive tone, making the negotiation feel more collaborative.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $85. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's a fair compromise that allows me to make a decent profit without risking losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures I secure the sale quickly and avoids the potential risk of further negotiation."
