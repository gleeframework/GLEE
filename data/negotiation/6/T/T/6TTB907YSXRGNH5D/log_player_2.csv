"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  There's a chance she might be willing to lower her price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It sounds like a great product.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to get closer to my target of $80."
