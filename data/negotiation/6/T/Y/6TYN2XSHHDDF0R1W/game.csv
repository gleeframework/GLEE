"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $9,000. It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
