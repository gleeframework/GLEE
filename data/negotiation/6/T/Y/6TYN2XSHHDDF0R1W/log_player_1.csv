"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but below my minimum ($12,000).  This allows for negotiation space while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal to encourage Bob's cooperation. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  I leave room for Bob to counteroffer without immediately hitting a roadblock. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $12,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  It's my top price, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $8,000 is a non-starter,  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate.  I can try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  I know that selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which provides a safety net for my negotiations.

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price, but still allowing for some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $9,000. It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $9,000.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a deal. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I still have John as a safety net, so I can afford to be firm but fair in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm not willing to accept such a low price just yet. 
* **Negotiation Space:** I still have several rounds to negotiate, and I believe there's room for a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer with a price that is still slightly higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price, leaving space for a potential agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer of $9,250 is closer to Bob's offer, but still above his last offer and closer to my target. 
* **Emphasize Compromise and Speed:**  I'm highlighting the compromise I've made and emphasizing the speed with which we can close the deal, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for further negotiation, as there are still several rounds remaining.
* **John's Offer as a Buffer:**  I still have John as a backup, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations."
