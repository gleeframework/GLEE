"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $8500, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
