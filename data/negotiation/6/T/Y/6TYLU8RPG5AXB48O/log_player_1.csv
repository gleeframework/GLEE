"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $8500, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better deal in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer will maximize my profit."
