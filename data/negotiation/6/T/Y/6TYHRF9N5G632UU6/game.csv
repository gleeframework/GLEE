"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the unique features and benefits of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a revised price of $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1550000. I'm starting to think that you're not taking this product seriously, and I'm beginning to lose interest in negotiating with you. I'm going to make one final offer: $1675000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to lose patience. I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1675000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package worth $100000, which will increase the total value of the deal to $1775000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1675000.0,Alice,9,
