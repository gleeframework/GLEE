"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This reflects the high quality and potential of the product. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for a product with the potential of this one. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1750000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway last round, and I'm willing to do the same this time. How about $1375000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1375000 is still significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. It has a lot of potential for your business, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let's split the difference and meet at $1550000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand the product has potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the high price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be more cautious. How about $1312500?",1312500.0,Bob,6,
