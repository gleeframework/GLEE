"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can get the product for $100 from John, I'll reject Alice's initial offer of $100.  This gives me a chance to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $80. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down in price. If not, I can always choose to buy from John in a later round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly to $90, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her lower than $90 in the next round.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Alice or buy from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $85.  This is a compromise between my previous offer of $80 and Alice's latest offer of $90.  I'm hoping that this will be a price Alice is willing to accept, as it's still a good deal for me. If she rejects it, I'll likely have to buy from John in a later round."
