"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175.  It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to lower the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. Accepting now ensures I get my desired minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or running out of rounds."
