"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll love it!  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, at $100, since I know the product is worth at least $80 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  Bob seems interested, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $90. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good price for the product. I'm also keeping the communication positive and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum price. $85 is not a bad deal, and there's a risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob might get frustrated and walk away. It's better to secure a deal now, even if it's slightly below my ideal price."
