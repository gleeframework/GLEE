"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a middle ground between our initial offers, providing a fair value for both parties involved.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,500 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $9,000? I believe this price is fair, and it would allow us to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
