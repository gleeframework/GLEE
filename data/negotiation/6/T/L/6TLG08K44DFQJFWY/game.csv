"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1400000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
