"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the game.** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.** This allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:** This counteroffer represents a substantial drop from Alice's $12,000 asking price. 
* **Fair compromise:** While still above Alice's minimum of $8,000, it's a price you are willing to pay, and it gives Alice room to negotiate.
* **Setting the tone:** This counteroffer shows that you are serious about negotiating and willing to be firm, but also reasonable."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You have more leverage.** You've shown you're willing to negotiate and have time to continue.
* **Rejecting the offer maintains your negotiating position.** By rejecting, you can counteroffer again and potentially secure a better price."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,100.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

* **Time is running out:** We are in the 9th round, and it's unlikely Alice will significantly lower her offer in the last round.
* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Even with a slight reduction, Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.
* **Buying from John is a better option:** You can buy the product for $15,000, which is still within your budget, and you don't risk losing time trying to negotiate a better price with Alice. 

It's important to weigh the potential of a better deal against the risk of running out of time and having to pay more from another seller. In this situation, buying from John is the more secure and efficient choice."
