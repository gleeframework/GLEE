"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see value in the product at this price, considering it's worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's latest offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counter again in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I initially hoped for, it's more than what John is offering, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I think it's a good deal for both of us."
