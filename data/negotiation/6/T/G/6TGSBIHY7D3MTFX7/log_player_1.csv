Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob is willing to pay significantly more ($1,500,000). Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item"" adds perceived value, making the high price more palatable to Bob."
