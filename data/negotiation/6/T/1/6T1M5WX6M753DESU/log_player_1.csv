Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This gives you a strong negotiating position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $12,000, offering it slightly lower at $11,500 might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage a quicker acceptance.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial to price it above John's $10,000 offer, ensuring you maximize your potential profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher, closer to $12,000.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer.  If you're risk-averse, you might offer it for slightly less, securing a guaranteed profit."
