"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for your budget, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
