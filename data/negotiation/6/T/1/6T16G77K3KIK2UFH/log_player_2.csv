# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think the product is worth more to me than $1,000,000, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better price.

Round 2

{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value and the potential returns I can expect from this product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $925,000?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is trying to get closer to her original price, but I'm not willing to meet her in the middle. I think $925,000 is still too high. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still not willing to pay $925,000, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I really think $825,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price."", ""product_price"": 825000}"
