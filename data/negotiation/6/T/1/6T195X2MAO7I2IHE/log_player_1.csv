Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Confidence in value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to invite Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profits with the desire to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* While it's tempting to take $7,000, I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* John is a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, which is a good safety net.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This is still a great deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but emphasize that it's too low for me. I then propose a counteroffer that's a midpoint between my desired price and his offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation friendly.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  It also encourages Bob to consider a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While he's shown some willingness to increase his offer, we're not close enough to my ideal price.
* **Selling to John guarantees me $8,000.** This is a safe and reliable option, especially considering the risk that further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a complete stalemate.
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and energy, potentially leading to missed opportunities with other buyers. 

By selling to John, I secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
