# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's priced below what I could potentially get from other buyers. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her product valuation, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay and higher than John's offer. You can save money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
