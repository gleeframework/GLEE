"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is significantly cheaper than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:** Even at $900,000, you're getting the product for less than your perceived value of $1,500,000.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save the most money."
