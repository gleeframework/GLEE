{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a little low for me. How about $13,500?  This is my final offer, I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price and get closer to my initial offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $12,750 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $13,000. There's still time in the negotiation, and I don't want to settle too quickly."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I was hoping to get a better price from Bob, it's becoming clear that we are too far apart.  I don't want to risk losing out on any sale at all.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm guaranteed $10,000, which is still above my minimum."
