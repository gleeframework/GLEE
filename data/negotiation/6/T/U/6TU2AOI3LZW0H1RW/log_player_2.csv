"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to propose a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Alice you're serious about buying the product but are also aiming for a price closer to your maximum. $10,500 is a significant drop from her initial offer, but it's still above her minimum price, allowing room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth the value I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a compromise, but it's still a bit higher than what you want to pay. You can likely negotiate a price closer to your target by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is closer to the middle ground we're aiming for. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you're willing to compromise while staying within your budget. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be honest, $10,750 is really cutting it close for me, but I value finding a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and land at $10,875? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your desired price point.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a price that's within your budget and saves you from further negotiation rounds."
