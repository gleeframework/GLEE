"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth the value I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is closer to the middle ground we're aiming for. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be honest, $10,750 is really cutting it close for me, but I value finding a deal that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and land at $10,875? This would be my final offer.",10875.0,Alice,5,
