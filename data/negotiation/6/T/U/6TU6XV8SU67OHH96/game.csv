"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130. Would you be willing to consider that? ",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. How about $140? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $140. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $155, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $150, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let me know.",150.0,Alice,5,
