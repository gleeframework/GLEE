"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so he shouldn't pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, I'm only willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $9500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can buy the product from John for $10,000, Alice is now offering it for $9,500, which is a better price.  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower the price, and Bob could end up paying more if he keeps rejecting offers and negotiating."
