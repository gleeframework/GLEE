"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This is a negotiating tactic to establish a starting point and gauge his interest. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'm aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth risking a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.  I'm aiming to close the gap between our prices and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,500,000. I'm also considering the fact that I have the option to sell to John, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm making a final concession and offering my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that this is a fair offer, considering his own valuation of the product and the possibility of me selling to John.  It's a high-risk, high-reward move, but I believe it's the best way to try and secure a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  I'm better off selling to John and securing the guaranteed price of $1,500,000."
