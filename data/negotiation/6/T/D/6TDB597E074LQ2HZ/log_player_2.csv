"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price. It's also worth noting that while John's offer is your maximum, it's still a better deal than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also below your maximum price, allowing you to still make a profit. This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price of $1,500,000. It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your target price. You can still get a better deal with John, so there's no pressure to accept Alice's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing Alice you're willing to meet her halfway, but still significantly lower than her last offer. It keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum price of $1,500,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price enough to meet your budget.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum price, it makes the most financial sense to buy from him and avoid any further negotiation."
