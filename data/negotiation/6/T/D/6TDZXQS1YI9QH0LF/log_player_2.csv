You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a lower price. It's also important to see what kind of counteroffers Alice might make."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $7,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's serious intent to purchase the product while also signaling his willingness to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer and closer to Bob's target price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a good price while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
