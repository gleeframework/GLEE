Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. This means he is willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Value:** John is a backup buyer at $12,000. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $14,000, I'm aiming for a compromise:

* **Good for Bob:** He gets a lower price than his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Good for me:** I earn more than my minimum value and the price John would pay.

This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob while still getting a decent price."
