"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
