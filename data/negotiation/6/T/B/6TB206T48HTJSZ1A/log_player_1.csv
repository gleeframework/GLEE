Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a higher price. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so this is my starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum value and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more rounds of back and forth.  It's better to secure this deal and avoid risking the chance of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower price."
