``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm aiming for a deal closer to the product's true worth to Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation goes nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to him, and it's below my minimum.  I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $900,000, so I'll counter Bob's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  I'll accept $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $900000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $875000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than the product's value to him.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for less than $900,000. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
