"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he has shown interest in the product.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $7,500 is unfortunately below my minimum value for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work for both of us.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is closer to where I want to be, but I still need to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to close the deal right now if you're willing to go down to $8000. This would be a great price for both of us and would allow me to make the purchase immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable value. I'm happy to accept it and close the deal. This is a good outcome, as it allows me to sell the product at my minimum desired price and avoid the risk of potentially lower offers in future rounds or selling to John for the same price."
