Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's worth significantly more to you, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
