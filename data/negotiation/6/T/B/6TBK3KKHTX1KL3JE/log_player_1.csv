{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have John as a backup buyer.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's worth significantly more to you, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I've already made a counteroffer, and it's getting late in the negotiation.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
