Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for some negotiation and potential for a higher final price.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to understand and respond to.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still reaching an agreement. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially counter Bob's offers. If negotiations become unproductive, you can always fall back on John's offer for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept his current offer. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By meeting Bob halfway, it demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a higher price point:**  $9,250 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired value.
* **Be clear and concise:** The message is simple, straightforward, and focuses on the benefits for both of us.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's getting close.  It's a good compromise, and considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and my desire to avoid further back-and-forth, accepting this offer is the best decision."
