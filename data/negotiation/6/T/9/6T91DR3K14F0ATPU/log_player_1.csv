"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I want to get as close to that value as possible. However, I need to consider that Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm starting with a price that's halfway between our values. This should make it more likely that Bob will engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal with Bob. Selling to John immediately would guarantee me my minimum value, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards, to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum value. By lowering the price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. Selling to John now would guarantee me a good profit, but I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but only by $500 this time. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, and showing a willingness to compromise.  At this price, I'm still above my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway.  This is a calculated risk, but I believe it's worth taking to try to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is approaching my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a higher price.  Selling to John would secure a significant profit, but I'm not willing to give up on the negotiation just yet.  I'll continue trying to find a middle ground with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final attempt to get Bob to meet me in the middle.  $9,750 is only $250 above Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum value. By making this final concession, I'm showing that I'm serious about closing a deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John to secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Only two rounds remain, and Bob's offer of $8,750 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. There's little chance that Bob will significantly raise his offer in the next round, making further negotiation futile. I've tried to be flexible and compromise throughout the process, but it's clear that a mutually agreeable price is unlikely. 

Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my desired profit and ensures I don't risk losing out on a valuable deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
