Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a good incentive to accept, as he values the product at $12,000.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for $10,500. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum price and leaves some room for a final deal. If Bob is serious about buying the product, I believe he'll find this offer reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time Bob's offer is closer to my minimum and worth accepting.  It's still a bit lower than my ideal price, but with the risk of losing the deal completely and having to sell to John at a lower price, it's the best option in this scenario."
