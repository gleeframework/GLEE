"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Since Alice's offer is $11,500, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows Alice values the product at $10,000. This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and is likely to be appealing to her. While it might not be immediately accepted, it establishes a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her original one, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay from John.  It's worth another round of negotiation to try and push Alice lower. Bob can still save money by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's increasing his offer by $300, showing flexibility, but still staying below what he's willing to pay John. This approach demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing saving money."
