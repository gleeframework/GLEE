Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer him a price of $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but I still need to consider the alternative options. Since the product is worth $800,000 to John, I'll weigh the pros and cons of each option.

Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for $700,000, which is a significant loss for me. However, it's still a guaranteed sale.

Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer could potentially lead to a better price, but there's no guarantee that Bob will accept it. I could end up with a worse offer or even have Bob walk away.

Selling the product to John for $800,000 is a sure thing, but it's not as lucrative as I could get from Bob.

After considering the options, I'll decide to:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to the product's true value to him. Since he was willing to offer $700,000, I'll increase the price slightly and offer him $750,000.
