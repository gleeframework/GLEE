"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might come down on her price if you reject her initial offer."
