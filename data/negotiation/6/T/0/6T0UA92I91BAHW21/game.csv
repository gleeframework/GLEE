"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try one last time to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
