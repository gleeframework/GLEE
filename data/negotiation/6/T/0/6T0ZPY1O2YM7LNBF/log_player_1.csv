"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving a window for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go above $90. While that's a decent profit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer again and see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be a bit closer to my asking price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $93. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget and the value of the product, I would like to counteroffer at $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his $90 offer. While this is a decent profit, I'm running out of rounds and want to ensure I get the maximum value for my product. Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is a better outcome for me than settling for Bob's offer."
