"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,200,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1,200,000 would be undervaluing the product significantly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,450,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
