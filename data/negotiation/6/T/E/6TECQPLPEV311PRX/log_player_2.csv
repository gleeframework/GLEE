"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above my target price. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a lower price.  I'll counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $850,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $875,000 is a good price for me.  It's still within my budget and saves me a good amount compared to buying from John.  I'll accept her offer."
