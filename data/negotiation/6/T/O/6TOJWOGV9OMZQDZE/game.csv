"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is as low as I can go without losing too much value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really hoping we can finalize this deal.  While $950,000 is a better price, I'm still only able to go up to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a price you can work with.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $925,000, which is $937,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",937500.0,Alice,7,
