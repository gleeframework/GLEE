"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to both of us, so let's find a price that works for both sides. I'm starting at $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  I'm proposing $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to move a little closer to your number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  $1,125,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we settle on $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up a little bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,150,000? That's my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
