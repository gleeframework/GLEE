"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I need to try and get a price closer to my budget. $14,000 is too close to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still a reasonable jump from my absolute limit ($12,000).  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I want to maintain a positive and respectful tone to encourage further negotiation. 
* **Justification:** While I didn't explicitly state my budget, implying it's a bit lower encourages Alice to move closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down significantly in price, and $12,500 is close enough to my $12,000 limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might save me a few hundred dollars, but it also risks Alice withdrawing the offer or me having to settle for John's price anyway.
* **Fair Deal:** $12,500 seems like a fair compromise, considering Alice's starting point."
