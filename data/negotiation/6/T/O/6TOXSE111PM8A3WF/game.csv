"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
