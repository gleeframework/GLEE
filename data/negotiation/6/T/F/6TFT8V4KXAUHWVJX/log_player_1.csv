Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for a steal at $99. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is just below your guaranteed price. This creates a sense of urgency and makes it a tempting deal for Bob, even though it's slightly above his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this offer leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially getting you even closer to your maximum possible profit."
