"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $9500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of a price of $10200, which is a bit closer to my original price but still a good compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
