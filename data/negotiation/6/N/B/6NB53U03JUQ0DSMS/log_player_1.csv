Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth much more to you than the asking price. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the value you'll derive from it."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product is valuable, but your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer him.  $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I still have time to negotiate with Bob and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John right now would mean leaving $400,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still reflects the value you'll receive, and allows us to move towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident we can reach a higher agreement.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try to maximize my profit.  Selling to John right now would mean leaving $200,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,200,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, given the significant benefits you'll receive from it.  Let's close this deal and get the product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
