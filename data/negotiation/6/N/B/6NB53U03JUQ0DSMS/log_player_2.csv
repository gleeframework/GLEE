"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth much more to you than the asking price. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the value you'll derive from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product is valuable, but your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still reflects the value you'll receive, and allows us to move towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,200,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, given the significant benefits you'll receive from it.  Let's close this deal and get the product in your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Fair Price:** $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. You're saving $250,000 off John's price and $150,000 off Alice's initial offer.
* **Time:** You're already on Round 5. While you have some rounds left, there's no guarantee Alice will go much lower. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.

It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better deal by continuing the negotiation. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of missing out."
