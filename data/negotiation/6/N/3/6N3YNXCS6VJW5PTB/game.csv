"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair and competitive price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to the table. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $900,000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
