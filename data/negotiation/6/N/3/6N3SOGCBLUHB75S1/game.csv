"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1500000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000.
