"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $9,500?  That's a good compromise and gives us both a fair deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
