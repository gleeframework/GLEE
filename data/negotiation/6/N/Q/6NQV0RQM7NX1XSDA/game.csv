"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob! However, $110 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,

"You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  Tell you what, let's make this our last exchange to save us both time. I'm willing to go up to $115. If that works for you, we have a deal!",115.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $115, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to make one last push for a higher price. How about we meet at $130, which is my absolute minimum?",130.0,Alice,7,
