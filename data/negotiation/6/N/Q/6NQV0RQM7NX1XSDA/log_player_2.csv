(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Alice's first offer is higher than our maximum budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** We want to be polite and express continued interest while making it clear the initial price is too high.  
* **Price:**  We're starting with an offer that's beneficial for us (Alice's value), knowing there's room for negotiation. It's a bit of an ambitious opening, but it sets a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is stubbornly staying above our maximum budget. While her offer has decreased, it's important to show we're also not willing to immediately settle for a price that doesn't work for us. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $110? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  We acknowledge Alice's attempt to negotiate while still steering the conversation toward a price that works for us.  The word ""compromise"" emphasizes a win-win solution.
* **Price:**  We're splitting the difference between our last offer ($100) and her current offer ($130).  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob! However, $110 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer, but $125 is still above our target price.  We're willing to push a bit further, but we need to be mindful that we're getting closer to John's $150 backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  Tell you what, let's make this our last exchange to save us both time. I'm willing to go up to $115. If that works for you, we have a deal!"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** We're injecting a sense of urgency and a ""final offer"" tone to encourage Alice to make a decision. This can help prevent the negotiation from dragging on.  We also frame it as a time-saver, subtly appealing to her desire for efficiency. 
* **Price:** We're making a smaller increase this time ($5), signaling that we're getting closer to our limit. $115 is a good middle ground â€“ still a significant saving for us while likely acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $115, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to make one last push for a higher price. How about we meet at $130, which is my absolute minimum? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has gone back up to $130, and even called it her ""absolute minimum"". This suggests she's unlikely to budge further. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks exceeding our $150 budget or running out of rounds. Buying from John for $150 ensures we get the product at a reasonable price without further hassle."
