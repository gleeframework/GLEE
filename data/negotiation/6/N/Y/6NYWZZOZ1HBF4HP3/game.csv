"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider something closer to $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to meet at least $100. Can you meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $90? That's a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a good deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,7,
