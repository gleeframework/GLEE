Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a good deal for you, and I think it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $95, and you have a guaranteed option at $80.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals are the ones you don't make (with a particular seller)."
