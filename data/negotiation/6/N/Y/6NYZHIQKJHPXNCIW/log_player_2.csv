"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price. You have room to bargain, as you're willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have two options:  

* **Reject:**  Reject her offer and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your $8,000 limit.  You have room to negotiate.
* **Buy from John:**  Since you can buy the product from John for $8,000, you can always choose this option if you feel Alice isn't going to budge further."
