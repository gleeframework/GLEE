"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,
