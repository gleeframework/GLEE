"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? This would allow me to make a fair purchase without straining my finances.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $975,000?  This would allow me to reach my target price while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $950,000 remains the most I can realistically afford at this time. I hope this proposal aligns better with your needs. Thank you for understanding.",950000.0,Bob,4,
