"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price given the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the price you're willing to accept.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $10,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,600. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the price you're willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree.  $9,600 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $9,900? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's the best price I can offer. Let me know your final decision.",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a last concession. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $9,900. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,700. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the price you're willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9700.0,Bob,8,
