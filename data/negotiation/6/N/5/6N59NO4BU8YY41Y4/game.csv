"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make it yours for $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1800000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1200000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to find a solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we discuss a price of $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. While $1300000 is a step closer, it's still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1300000, which would be $1150000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While $1150000 is closer to my target, I still need to be under $1000000 to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This represents a substantial compromise for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1100000. I'm willing to make one last compromise, and I'll meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, which would be $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
