"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to try and reach an agreement.  This still leaves you a considerable profit margin while allowing me to achieve a more reasonable price for my product. Let's work together to find a solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 is still not quite enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.  This offer reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows us to close this deal fairly.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
