"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $13,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $16,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $14,500 still isn't quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize this. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,250 is close enough to my minimum price point, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
