Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to price the product attractively for Bob, knowing that Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 if he declines."
