Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am still aiming to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to reach an agreement closer to my limit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob seems firmly set on $100 and is unlikely to budge. It's not worth my time to haggle when I have a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum with John."
