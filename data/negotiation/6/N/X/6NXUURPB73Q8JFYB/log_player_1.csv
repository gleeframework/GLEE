""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, even worth significantly more than the asking price. However, I value a quick and easy sale. Would $1,400,000 interest you?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try and get a higher price first. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it just above that would likely result in an immediate rejection.  Offering it slightly below John's price gives Bob a significant ""discount"" while still netting Alice a substantial profit.
* **Urgency and Value Perception:** The message hints at the product's value exceeding the asking price, encouraging Bob to consider the deal seriously. Mentioning a ""quick and easy sale"" adds a touch of urgency."
