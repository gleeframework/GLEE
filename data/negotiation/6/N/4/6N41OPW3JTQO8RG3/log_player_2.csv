"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still quite a bit above your desired price range. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $750,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to your desired price range, it's still a bit high. You want to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $780,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $815,000 is getting closer to your desired price range, it's still higher than your target. You're committed to saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to your goal price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts in finding a price that works. I'm still committed to finding a deal, but $815,000 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
