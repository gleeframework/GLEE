"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $750,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $780,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts in finding a price that works. I'm still committed to finding a deal, but $815,000 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
