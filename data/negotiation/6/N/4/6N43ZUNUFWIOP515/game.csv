"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $100 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $90 for the product. This is my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I can do $95 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",95.0,Alice,5,
