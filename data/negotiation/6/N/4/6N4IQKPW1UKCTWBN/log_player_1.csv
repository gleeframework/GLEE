"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $60 is far too low for me, and I'm hoping we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate.  How about $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $75 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm committed to buying this product from you, but I have a strict budget. My final offer is $80. If you can make that work, we have a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $120.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
