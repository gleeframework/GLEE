Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we try $125? It's a small step closer to my original price, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125. It makes more sense to buy from John for $120 and avoid further back-and-forth."
