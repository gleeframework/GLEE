"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll still find this a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $107.50 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $108.75? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",108.75,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your continued interest.  While $106.25 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $107.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and we can finally close this deal.",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $106. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $106.75? Can we meet in the middle?",106.75,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $106.75 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $107.00.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",107.0,Alice,9,
