"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $15,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high for Bob, as it's worth $12,000 to him. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. Let's say... $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While there are still more rounds,  it's unlikely that Alice will come down to a price Bob is willing to pay.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at $12,000 to avoid further negotiations and ensure he gets the product at his target price."
