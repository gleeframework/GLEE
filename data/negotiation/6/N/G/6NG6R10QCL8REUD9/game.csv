"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. Let's say... $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13750.0,Alice,5,
