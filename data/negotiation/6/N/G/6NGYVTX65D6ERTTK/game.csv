"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I have to be honest with you, $130000 is not even close to the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time, but I need to get at least $1300000 for it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
