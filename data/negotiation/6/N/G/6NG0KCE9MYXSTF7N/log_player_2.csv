"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive negotiation tone.** 
* **Show interest in the product but signal the initial price is too high.**
* **Offer a significant decrease ($30) to encourage Alice to negotiate further.** 

The goal is to reach a price closer to Alice's $80 valuation while staying well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're making progress, but $115 is still a bit high. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. Would you be willing to do $105? That would work for me."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Acknowledge Alice's compromise:**  We want to show we're negotiating in good faith.
* **Slight increase:**  We're nudging up our offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but not by much. 
* **Firm but fair:** The tone suggests this is a serious offer, and we're getting close to a deal."
