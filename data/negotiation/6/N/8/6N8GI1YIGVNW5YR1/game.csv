"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering our previous discussions.",14000.0,Bob,4,
