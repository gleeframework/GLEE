Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
