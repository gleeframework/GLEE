Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer at a price closer to that.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to compromise:**  By not asking for the full $10,000, you show Bob you're open to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's not worth it to sell to him at that price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your value.  How about $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not worth it for me to accept. John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, which is a better deal than risking further negotiation with Bob. It's time to sell to John and move on."
