(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one! Alice is very slowly coming down, and we're getting close to my limit. There's a chance she might settle at $12,500, but also a chance she won't budge further.  

Let's try one more counteroffer, but be ready to switch to John if she doesn't budge:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

...And for round 8:

```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really tough!  I'm willing to go to $12,250, but that's absolutely my final offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
```"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","You're mixing up the names a bit! Let's stick with Alice as the seller. Here's the counteroffer for round 8 as planned:

""message"": ""Alice, you're really tough!  I'm willing to go to $12,250, but that's absolutely my final offer.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John."",

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go to $12,250, but I'm not willing to give up on the profit I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $12,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and you've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the $12,000 deal with John."
