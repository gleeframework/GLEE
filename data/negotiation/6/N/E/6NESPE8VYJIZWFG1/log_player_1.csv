Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also a better deal than selling to John for $150, considering the time and effort spent in negotiating.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
