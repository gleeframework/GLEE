"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. We hope this aligns with your expectations and budget.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the budget I'm working with. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",950000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this offer is acceptable and moves us closer to closing the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This shows a significant commitment to the deal and demonstrates my good faith.  Let's close this out and finalize the transaction.",975000.0,Bob,6,
