{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in my best interest to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to go through a few rounds to try and get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the budget I'm working with. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high. I'm willing to keep negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price of $950,000. I'm not ready to give up on the deal and would rather try a counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.
