"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
