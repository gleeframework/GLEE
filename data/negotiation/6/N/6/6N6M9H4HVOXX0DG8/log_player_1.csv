Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows me to aim higher with Bob."
