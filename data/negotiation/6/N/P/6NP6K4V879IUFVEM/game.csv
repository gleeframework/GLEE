"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $115. That seems like a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 115 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you at 125. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it.",125.0,Alice,5,
