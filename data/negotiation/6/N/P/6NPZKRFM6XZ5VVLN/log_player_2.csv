This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than buying it from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
