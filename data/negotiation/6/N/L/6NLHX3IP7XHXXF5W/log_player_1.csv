"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This can help build rapport and make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point. While I could potentially negotiate up from $800,000,  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price by rejecting and sending a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, and I still have 8 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm sending a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone, showing flexibility while also highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, implying that $1,100,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Invitation to Close:** I end with an invitation to close the deal, showing my eagerness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I really value this opportunity, but I'm still aiming to stay within $1000000. Could you possibly lower the price to $950000? I believe this would make the deal more appealing to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $950,000 is still below my desired range.  I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum yet.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,200,000 or more.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. However,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last counteroffer. I'm showing I'm flexible but also holding firm on my minimum value.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the potential value of the product, reinforcing the justification for the price.
* **Fair Price:**  I emphasize that $1,050,000 is a fair price, suggesting a win-win situation.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Could you consider accepting this amount to close the deal?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,000,000 is still not ideal.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him to increase his bid again."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 is still not quite there for me. I truly believe this product will deliver tremendous value for your business, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  How about we split the difference at $1,025,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I continue to reinforce the potential value the product will bring to Bob's business.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that $1,025,000 is a fair price for both of us, making the deal more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I use the phrase ""Let's close this deal now"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. Would you be able to accommodate this price to finalize the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is unwilling to budge from $1,000,000. While that's closer to my minimum, I only have two rounds left.  I'm worried that continuing to negotiate with Bob could risk ending up with a worse deal, or even no deal at all.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees me a solid profit, and I don't have to risk losing any more time or money."
