"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1100000? Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I really value this opportunity, but I'm still aiming to stay within $1000000. Could you possibly lower the price to $950000? I believe this would make the deal more appealing to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work with me. However,  $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm prepared to accept $1050000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1000000 is still not quite there for me. I truly believe this product will deliver tremendous value for your business, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  How about we split the difference at $1025000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment.  Let's close this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
