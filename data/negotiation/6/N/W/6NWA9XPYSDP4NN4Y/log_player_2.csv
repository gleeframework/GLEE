"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start by offering his absolute maximum price, $12,000. This establishes his firm boundary and leaves room for potential compromise.  It's a bold move, but with only 10 rounds, it's necessary to make a strong first impression."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price point. He has more rounds and can continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

Bob should counter with $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise, halfway between his initial offer and Alice's last offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his budget, it's still not the best deal. He should continue to negotiate for a lower price. With five rounds remaining, there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but only slightly. $14,000 shows he's willing to budge, but also maintains a firm position within his budget.  With limited rounds left, it's important to move closer to a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept, it's still over his budget. With only three rounds left, he needs to push for a better deal. He can still afford to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

Bob should offer $14,500. This is a small increase from his previous offer, but it demonstrates his willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. With only two rounds remaining, he needs to make a move closer to a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  It is clear that Alice is not willing to go below her desired price point. Bob has only one round left, and there is a significant chance that Alice will reject his counteroffer. 

This is the most logical choice given the current negotiation situation. While he could counteroffer one last time, there's no guarantee of success, and it risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at his desired price."
