,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Can we meet in the middle at $930,000?",930000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $930,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm firm on a price of $940,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the value of the product for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's make this deal happen!",940000.0,Alice,5,
