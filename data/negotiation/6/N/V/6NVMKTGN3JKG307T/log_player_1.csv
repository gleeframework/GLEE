Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While starting at $120 is tempting, it might make Bob feel like there's no point in negotiating and he'll simply walk away.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring the sale doesn't fall through."
