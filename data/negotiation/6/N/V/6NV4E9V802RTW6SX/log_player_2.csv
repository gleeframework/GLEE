"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item has been meticulously crafted to meet the highest standards and offers unparalleled value. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $12,000 to us. However, we're willing to consider a reasonable offer from you. Considering its worth to you is $8,000, let's aim for a price that reflects its true value while ensuring both parties benefit. We propose an offer of $10,000. This allows us to maintain a fair profit while providing you with a significant discount compared to our initial valuation. Please let us know if this offer aligns with your expectations, or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is presented well, $10,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price or proceeding with your backup plan."
