"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. I'm starting at $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  It's important that we both feel like we're getting a good deal.  Let's try $850,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still gives you a good price.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do even better. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $800,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
