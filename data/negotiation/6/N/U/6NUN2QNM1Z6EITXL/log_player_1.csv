Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for everyone. I'm starting at $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting at $900,000, which is slightly above the value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate to show I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my starting price and even lower than the product's worth to him.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  It's important that we both feel like we're getting a good deal.  Let's try $850,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still gives you a good price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do even better. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below the product's worth to him and is only slightly above his previous offer.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000. I'll try to get closer to that price with my counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $800,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back and forth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
