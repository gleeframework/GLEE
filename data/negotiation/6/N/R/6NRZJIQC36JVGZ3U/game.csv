"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $107.50 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $95. Let's make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still not quite there with $95. Let's try $100.  It's a good price for both of us and avoids further negotiation.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us and saves us both some time.",92.5,Bob,6,
