# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than $8,500. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to take that deal."
