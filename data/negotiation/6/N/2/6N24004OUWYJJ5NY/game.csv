,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This price is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's try to close this deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
