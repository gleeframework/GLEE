"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell now,  I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
