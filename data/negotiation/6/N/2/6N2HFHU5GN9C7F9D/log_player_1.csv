Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $20,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe $12,000 is within a reasonable range given my budget. Would it be possible to reach an agreement closer to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob is not budging from his $12,000 offer. It's clear further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. Accepting his offer would be a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer."
