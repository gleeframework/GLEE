Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone in my message to keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me confidence to be firm in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine my next move. 
* **Be Prepared to Counter:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll need to be ready with a counteroffer that's still profitable for me.
* **Don't Be Afraid to Walk Away:** If the negotiations become too drawn out or Bob's offers are too low, I'm ready to sell to John and ensure a minimum profit of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I believe we can reach a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer allows me to take a risk and reject Bob's initial offer. I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob's subsequent counteroffers become too low or the negotiation stalls, I will sell the product to John to secure my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This price is fair, considering the value you place on the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** The price still allows me to make a substantial profit, which is my goal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's response and decide whether to accept or reject his potential counteroffer.
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate Further:** If Bob doesn't accept, I'm ready to continue negotiating, keeping John as a backup option.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:** I will be firm in my negotiations to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum profit requirements."
