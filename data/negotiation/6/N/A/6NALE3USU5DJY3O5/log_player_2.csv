"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's a risk she'll refuse and you'll be stuck paying John's higher price."
