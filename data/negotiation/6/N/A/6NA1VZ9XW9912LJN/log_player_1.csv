Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, the $950,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, given my financial situation and the market value of similar products, I believe $950,000 was already a reasonable compromise. I am unable to increase my offer further. I would like to stick at $950,000 for the product.

Bob seems firmly set at $950,000. While further negotiation might be possible, it's unlikely to yield a significant increase. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
