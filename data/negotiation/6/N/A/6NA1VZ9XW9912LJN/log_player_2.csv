Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, the $950,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?
