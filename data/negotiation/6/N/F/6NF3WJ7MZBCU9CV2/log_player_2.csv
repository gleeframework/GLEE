I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it.

Alice seems unlikely to budge significantly from her $1,050,000 offer.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,000,000, saving you $50,000."
