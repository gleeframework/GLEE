"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. I'm interested but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit higher than you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
