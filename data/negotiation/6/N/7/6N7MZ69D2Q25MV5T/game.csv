"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're open to this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
