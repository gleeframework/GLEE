"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting, focusing on the value the product offers to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Open negotiations:**  By offering a price that's lower than Bob's perceived value, I'm incentivizing him to negotiate.
* **Maximise profit:** I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but lower than what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can adjust my offer based on Bob's reaction, aiming to secure a deal that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can still get a better price.  By rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round, I can:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his initial counteroffer, I show him that I'm not settling. 
* **Increase potential profit:**  There's a chance I can secure a higher price than $85 in future rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $85. I'll try to be firm but fair in my counteroffer, aiming for a deal that's closer to my desired outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product.  How about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $90, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to accept his lowball offer.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob. I'm also highlighting the fact that this is still a great deal for him.

This approach aims to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his last offer and offering a counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Increase potential profit:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price, but I want to keep it within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I can't go above $87. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing negotiations. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better price:** I'm only $3 away from my ideal price.  There's still room for compromise and I believe I can push Bob to $90.
* **Limited rounds:** I have several rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a sale that is below my preferred price.
* **Leverage:** Bob is showing interest, indicating that he wants the product. This gives me leverage to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $90. I will try to emphasize the value of the product to Bob and frame my counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  Let's split the difference.  $89 would be a great deal for both of us. It's fair and allows us to make this deal happen. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $89, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's latest offer of $87.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fact that this offer is a fair compromise and a win-win situation for both of us. I'm also expressing confidence that this will allow us to close the deal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrate my willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Increase chances of acceptance:**  By splitting the difference, I'm offering a more attractive option for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Maintain pressure:**  By not accepting his last offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not settling for a low price, encouraging him to consider my offer seriously."
