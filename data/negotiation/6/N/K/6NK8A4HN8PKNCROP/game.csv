"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and allows for a fair deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing discussion, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000, reflecting a compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850,000. I think this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below what I consider a fair price.  I'm willing to meet you one last time at $865,000. This price represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",865000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $865,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, which is $825,000.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $825,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you one last time at $840,000.  This price is a considerable compromise, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",840000.0,Alice,7,
