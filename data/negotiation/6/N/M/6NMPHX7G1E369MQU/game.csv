"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $13,000? I'm flexible and willing to work with you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation time.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  I really believe this product is worth it to you. Let's close the deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close the deal right now if you'll accept $9,500.  That's the most I can offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is just not enough for me. I'm ready to close the deal right now for $10,500. That's my very last offer before I have to consider other options.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,7,
