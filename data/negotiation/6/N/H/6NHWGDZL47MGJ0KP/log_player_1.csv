Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher (50% above his valuation) allows room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum possible profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone remains open-ended (""Let me know your thoughts""), signaling willingness to negotiate and avoid losing the sale entirely.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is risky. Bob might be immediately turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. 
* Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer is crucial. If he completely rejects it, there's still room to adjust and move closer to his valuation before he walks away. 

**The goal is to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale, knowing there's a guaranteed backup offer from John.**"
