"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's start at $850000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This shows I'm serious about acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $875000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $887500. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. I'm confident this price will be a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
