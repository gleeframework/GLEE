"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know your decision, and we can finalize the details.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at a lower price, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
