"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation, but I want to maximize my potential profit in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a higher price. $850,000 is better than John's offer, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  However, it's still a good price for me and leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter again if he's still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $875,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, I believe I can get a bit more with continued negotiations.  The risk of selling to John for $800,000 is too high at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

I'm going to offer $890,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still closer to my desired price than Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm not willing to settle for much less than my target."
