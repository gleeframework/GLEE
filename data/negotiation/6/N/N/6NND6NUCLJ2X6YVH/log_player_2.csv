"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its high value to you at $120, I propose we make this transaction even more appealing. How about we agree on a price of $100 for you today? This way, you save $20 compared to its perceived value, and I'm able to secure a profit that meets my business goals. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $120. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John."
