"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12750 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13250. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $13000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",13000.0,Bob,6,
