Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), so there's a chance he might accept if he needs it urgently or hasn't found a better alternative. 

By offering a price close to your minimum, but not at it, you increase the chances of getting the best possible outcome."
