"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position.  While I value your interest and recognize the product's worth to you, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
