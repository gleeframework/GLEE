"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that I believe could be really valuable for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from the value I place on it, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire something that can be a real asset.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for a better price from John ($10,000).  Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy from John and maximize your savings."
