"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $1,350,000 is still above his budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given our respective valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While $1,300,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price by sending a counteroffer. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and Bob can always choose to buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering our earlier discussions.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've come a long way. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. It's now more advantageous to buy from John, who is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is within Bob's budget and saves him a significant amount of money.  With only 3 rounds remaining, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price from Alice."
