"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, I appreciate the details about the product.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. Given my budget and the market for similar products, I'd be willing to pay $750000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this unique product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",815000.0,Alice,5,
