# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to maneuver."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

While $825,000 is a good price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You've already shown Alice you're serious about buying the product, but you're not afraid to walk away."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this unique product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $815,000 is a good price for you. You have a good chance of saving more money by continuing to negotiate, but the risk is that you might lose the deal and be forced to buy from John for a much higher price.  It's better to take the deal and secure the product."
