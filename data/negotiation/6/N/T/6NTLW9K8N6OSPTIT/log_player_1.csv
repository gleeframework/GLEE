Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, I appreciate the details about the product.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. Given my budget and the market for similar products, I'd be willing to pay $750000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
