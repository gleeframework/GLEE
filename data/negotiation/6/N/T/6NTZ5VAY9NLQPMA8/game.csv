"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay within my limits.
