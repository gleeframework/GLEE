"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $11,500. This gives you a significant saving while still allowing me to achieve a good price. Let me know what you think!
