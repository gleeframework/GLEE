"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  This is a chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in our favor. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:** We provide a reason for the high price (""its potential value"") without revealing our bottom line. 
* **Positive Framing:**  We emphasize the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""unique"" nature of the product to increase its perceived value.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our initial offer and Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,500,000).  We have room to negotiate, and it's too early to settle for a price this low. We'll counter in the next round to try and move closer to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the true worth of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We briefly acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low.
* **Compromise:** We signal flexibility by making a significant move from our initial price, but not so much that we appear desperate. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This common negotiation tactic encourages agreement by framing the new price as a balanced solution. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We continue to subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to encourage a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to a price we find acceptable, but we're not there yet.  He's anchored at $950,000, and we're aiming closer to $1,150,000. By continuing to negotiate, we increase the chances of exceeding $1,050,000, especially since Bob clearly sees significant value in the product. We're not at a point where selling to John for $800,000 is our best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen -  $1,100,000, and we have a deal.  This reflects the value while acknowledging your willingness to find common ground."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency & Agreement:** We're introducing a sense of urgency to push for a close while still aiming for a strong price.  Phrases like ""Let's make this happen"" and ""we have a deal"" encourage Bob to finalize the negotiation.
* **Concession & Justification:** We're conceding slightly from our previous offer to demonstrate flexibility but are still anchoring our price above Bob's last offer. We justify this price by connecting it to the product's value and Bob's desire to acquire it.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us in a favorable position. If Bob accepts, we've secured a significantly higher price than his initial offer. If he counters, we're still above our walk-away point and can re-evaluate our options in the next round."
