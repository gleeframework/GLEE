Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's understanding of its worth. 
* **Confident Tone:** A confident tone can make the offer more appealing and suggest the price is non-negotiable, though you're always willing to discuss.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob at a premium price while still having the safety net of John's offer."
