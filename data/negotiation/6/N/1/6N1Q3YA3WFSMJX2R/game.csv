"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit higher than you were thinking, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can meet you halfway between $12000 and $15000, which would be $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell at $11000. I can do $12500, which is a compromise between our last two offers. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $11750? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $13000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not willing to go up to $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made a counteroffer at $13000 and you've rejected it. I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price, so I'll offer $12500. This is my final offer, so I expect you to accept it.",12500.0,Alice,9,
