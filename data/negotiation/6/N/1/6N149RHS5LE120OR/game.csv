"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is a significant dip from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,150,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
