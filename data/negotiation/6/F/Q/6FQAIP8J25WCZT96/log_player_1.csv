Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While Alice could start higher, asking for the full $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and could make him walk away.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, Alice is still likely to get a better price than the $10,000 John is offering."
