"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product, Bob. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let you have it for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  You have the option to buy from John for $12,000, so rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice will go lower is a good strategy."
