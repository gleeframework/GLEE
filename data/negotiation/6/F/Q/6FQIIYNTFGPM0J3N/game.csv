"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price still represents a good value for the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
