**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always better to try and negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Since you have a backup offer from John, you can try to meet her halfway.  Offering $850,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget."
