"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still quite far from your target of under $1,000,000.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you can start a negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* **John is always an option.**  If the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well, you can always buy from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I'm going to need to come in lower.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that is $100,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to make a move.
* **Reasonable price:** $850,000 is still well within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to finding a compromise.  This helps build a rapport and avoids escalating the negotiation unnecessarily."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I have to consider my own bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product for $925,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **More room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price.  
* **John is always a safety net:**  If I don't get a better price, I can always purchase from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's split the difference and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm raising my offer by $25,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $912,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful increase:** I'm only increasing my offer by $15,000. This demonstrates I'm taking her counteroffer seriously and making a genuine effort to reach a compromise.
