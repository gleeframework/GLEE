"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if he's going to start lowballing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a significant discount from my minimum, but it's a compromise that hopefully shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be more attractive to Bob while still leaving me room for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to sell for that price.  I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at this price.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, and want to avoid having to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is not acceptable, and we're running out of time.  While I'd prefer to make more money, I'm confident in selling to John for $12,000 and I'll avoid the risk of Bob continuing to make lowball offers."
