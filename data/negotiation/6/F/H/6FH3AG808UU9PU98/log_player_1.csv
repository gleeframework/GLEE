I'm starting with a price higher than what I would sell it to John for, as I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm also aware that it's worth $80 to him, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$100 is too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's higher than what I'd sell it to John for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to agree on a price. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'll sell to John."
