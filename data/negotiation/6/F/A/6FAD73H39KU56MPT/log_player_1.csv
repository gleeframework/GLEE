Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I need to make sure I get at least that much. 
* **Potential for More:** I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $1,200,000. By offering $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and a potential higher profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so if Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale."
