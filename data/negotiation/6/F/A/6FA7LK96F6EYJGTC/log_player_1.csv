Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant return on investment while recognizing the worth of what I'm offering.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential ROI helps justify the high price to Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, Bob likely understands you have other options (John), creating a subtle sense of urgency."
