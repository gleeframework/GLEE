"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still leaves me with a good profit margin.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've emphasized that I'm open to negotiation to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Building Relationship:**  My message aims to create a positive and friendly tone to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While $100 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate and his message suggesting a middle ground makes me believe further negotiation is possible.
* **Avoiding John:**  While selling to John is an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and signals a willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Positive Language:** My message emphasizes ""fair price"" and ""moving forward"" to maintain a positive tone and encourage a deal.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:**  $110 is still well above my minimum price point, ensuring a profitable outcome."
