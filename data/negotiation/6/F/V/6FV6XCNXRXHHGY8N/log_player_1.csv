Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $140 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), giving me room to negotiate if needed.
    * It's still a compelling offer compared to my guaranteed sale price to John ($150). 

This strategy aims to find a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding the risk of him rejecting the offer."
