# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is a limited-time offer, so don't hesitate to accept it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can likely get a better deal from Alice than $95.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it's more than fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still hoping to get the product for less than $90.  Alice is willing to negotiate, so you should keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $88.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence. Considering the value of the product and your interest, how about we finalize the deal at $89? This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated a price lower than your initial goal.  At $89, you're getting the product for a price that's within your budget, and it's still a better deal than buying it from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
