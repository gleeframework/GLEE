Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $1500000 is at the upper end of my budget. To make this a viable deal, I'd be willing to offer $1200000.  This reflects the value I see in the product at this time. I'm eager to explore this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
