"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $750,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $760,000? That reflects a fair compromise for both of us, I believe.",760000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $765,000. This is as close to your desired price as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might need to consider other offers.",765000.0,Alice,7,
