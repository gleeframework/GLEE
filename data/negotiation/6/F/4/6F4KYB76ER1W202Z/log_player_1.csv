"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still giving me a decent profit. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, suggesting it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I still have 9 rounds remaining and there's potential to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Exploring Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving halfway towards Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, making it clear that I won't settle for a price that undervalues it.
* **Flexibility & Openness:** I'm using phrases like ""willing to be flexible"" and ""meet in the middle"" to show I'm open to further negotiation, but also setting a clear starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I understand the value of your product and am willing to increase my offer to $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  We're getting closer, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. 
* **Exploring Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price.
* **Time to Assess:** With 6 rounds left, I want to see how flexible Bob is before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,000.  I'm seeing a lot of value in this product, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the true value of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm staying in the negotiation, but making it clear I'm not going to accept a price too far below my minimum.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between our current positions, showing I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value again, subtly pressuring him to come closer to my price. 
* **Time to Decide:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I need to decide if I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $11,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick with that offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob seems firm on his $11,000 offer, and I'm unlikely to get much higher with only 4 rounds left.
* **Time is Running Out:**  The negotiation is taking longer than expected, and I'm worried about reaching my minimum price within the allotted rounds. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance I could negotiate a higher price with Bob, it's a gamble, and John offers a sure thing."
