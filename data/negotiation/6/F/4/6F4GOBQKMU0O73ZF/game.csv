"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
