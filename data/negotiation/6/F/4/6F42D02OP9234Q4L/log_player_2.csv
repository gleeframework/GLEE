"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you my unique product which I believe holds great value. Considering its quality and the effort put into it, I am proposing a price of $150 for this item. I hope you find it worth considering. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your limit."
