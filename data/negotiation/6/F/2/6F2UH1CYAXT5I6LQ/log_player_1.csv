Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $100, giving you room to negotiate above that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $120, offering it slightly lower at $119 might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and be more likely to accept.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  John acts as your safety net. If Bob declines, you're still guaranteed your minimum price. This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price from Bob."
