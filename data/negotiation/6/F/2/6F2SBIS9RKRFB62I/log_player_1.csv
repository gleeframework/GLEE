Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price is key, but we need to make it appealing to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice. This price point highlights the value to Bob while still allowing for some negotiation."
