"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  $11,500 is still above his target of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer to pay less, $11,000 is still a good deal for him compared to John's price of $12,000.  At this point, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to go lower, and the risk of her rejecting his counteroffer means he might end up paying even more."
