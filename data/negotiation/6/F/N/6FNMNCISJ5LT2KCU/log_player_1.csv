"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable margin:** The price is significantly lower than my minimum value, ensuring I can still make a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and willingness to discuss further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **No rush:**  With 8 rounds left, I can afford to keep negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, which keeps me in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, which shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Middle ground:** $1,150,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a logical compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message emphasizes fairness and the possibility of reaching an agreement. 
* **Remaining flexible:**  The message leaves the door open for further negotiation if needed."
