"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
