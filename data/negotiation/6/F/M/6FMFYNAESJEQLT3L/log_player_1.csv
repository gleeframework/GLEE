Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000). This creates a negotiation anchor and leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" provides a reason for the high price without explicitly stating its worth to you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially negotiate, giving you a chance to understand his reservations and potentially adjust the offer slightly downward while still remaining above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting enough to accept. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate slightly downwards or proceed with John's guaranteed offer."
