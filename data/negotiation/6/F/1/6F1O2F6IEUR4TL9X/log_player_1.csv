"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, but still leaves me with a profit of $100,000. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit at this stage. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer gives Bob a better price than before, but it also leaves me with a decent profit margin. I'm hoping that this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it's worth accepting.  While I could potentially try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. I'm happy to secure this sale and move on."
