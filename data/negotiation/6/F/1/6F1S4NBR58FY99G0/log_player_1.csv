Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it would be of significant value to you. Considering its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a high offer aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A slightly lower price than Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation while staying above Alice's minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives Alice leverage. This ensures she doesn't settle for less than her minimum."
