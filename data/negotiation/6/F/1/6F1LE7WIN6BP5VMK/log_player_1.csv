Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* This allows room for negotiation if Bob counters, but also leaves me with a considerable profit margin. 
*  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I believe I can achieve a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm willing to explore other price points before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000** is a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial valuation. 
* This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* The message acknowledges Bob's concerns but also emphasizes the value of the product, making it clear that I'm not willing to accept a price too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. While I understand your proposal, I must stick to my budgetary constraints. I am willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is still significantly less than my ideal price ($1,500,000), it's a much better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000.  The price is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and I'm at risk of losing a deal with Bob,  which would be a significant loss of profit for me.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and prevents further negotiations. It's a calculated risk that balances maximizing profit with minimizing the risk of losing a deal."
