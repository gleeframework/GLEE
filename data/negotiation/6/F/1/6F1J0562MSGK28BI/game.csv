"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low for this product.  Its unique value justifies a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I can offer $700,000.  I believe this reflects a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $850,000? This accounts for the value it offers while recognizing your budget concerns.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and agree on $800,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
