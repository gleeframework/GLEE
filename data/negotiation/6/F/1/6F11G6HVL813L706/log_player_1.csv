"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's lowball offer. I'll try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'd agree.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  I'm eager to move forward with this purchase, so let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob seems unwilling to budge, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
