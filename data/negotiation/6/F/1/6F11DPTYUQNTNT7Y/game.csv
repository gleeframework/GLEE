"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900,000 right now.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground, how about $950,000?  I believe this is a fair offer considering our both our positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution, but $1,050,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
