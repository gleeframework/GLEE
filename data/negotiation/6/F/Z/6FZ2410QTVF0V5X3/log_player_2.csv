"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration and evaluation, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This price reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also the unique benefits it offers to individuals like yourself. I trust that you will find its features and capabilities to be well worth the investment. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $10,000, meaning there's a good chance she might be willing to go lower to make a sale. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for a counter-offer that could save you even more money."
