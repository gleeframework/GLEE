"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $120 for this product. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm sure this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I believe this product holds, I would like to propose an offer of $140. This seems to be a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $140 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $145.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable investment."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value I see in this product, I would like to propose an offer of $142. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had 6 rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while we're getting close to my minimum price, I'm concerned we may not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale at $150, which is more than my minimum, so it's the safest option at this point."
