"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is extremely valuable, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find attractive. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I do see the potential value in this product. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900000.  This reflects my understanding of the market value for similar products, and I believe it's a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is a bit too low for me considering the unique value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1050000? This price still gives you a significant advantage and allows us to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $975000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
