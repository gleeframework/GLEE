"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my willingness to purchase it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but $1,150,000 is still beyond my financial limits. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  However, I need to be realistic about its value. Let's settle at $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still committed to this deal, but $1,050,000 remains a challenge for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a substantial increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in securing this product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
