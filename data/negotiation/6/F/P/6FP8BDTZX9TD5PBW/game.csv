"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $800000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while giving me a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
