Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

Explanation: While Alice's final offer of $795,000 is tempting, it's still more than your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not budging further and you potentially losing out on the $800,000 option.  It's more strategic to secure the known deal with John."
