,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $980,000? It's a fair price considering the potential value of the product, and it's within my range. ",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, but I'm open to negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
