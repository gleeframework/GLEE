{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget.  It's a starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my maximum, but it's getting closer. I'll reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is just above your maximum, but still a good compromise.  It shows Alice you're serious about buying, but still want a fair deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my maximum, and I've already made a counteroffer.  It's getting frustrating, and I'm concerned that Alice might not be willing to come down to my price.  At this point, it's better to secure the product at a known price from John."
