"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John is willing to pay that amount. This sets a strong baseline for the negotiation and leaves room for potential concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and my value for the product. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic drop in price this early in the negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also firm on getting a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  He's not budging much, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a price that's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm running out of time, but I'm determined to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of our negotiations and Bob's offers are still far too low. I'm not willing to take such a significant loss, and I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse.  With John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to him."
