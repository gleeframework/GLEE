Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $8,000 yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident that John is a secure buyer.  Selling to John will guarantee me the $8,000 I need."
