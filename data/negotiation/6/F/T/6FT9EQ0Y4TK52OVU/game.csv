"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $14000? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $14500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",13500.0,Bob,6,
