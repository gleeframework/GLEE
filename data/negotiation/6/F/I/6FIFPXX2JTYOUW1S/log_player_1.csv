Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I know this product is valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** By stating you ""know this product is valuable to [him],"" you subtly acknowledge his potential needs and frame the price as aligned with the value it provides.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a safety net, guaranteeing you at least $12,000.  This allows you to be bolder in your initial ask to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price if needed, but always aim to stay above your minimum of $12,000."
