"Alice,  $1,600,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm serious about buying this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
