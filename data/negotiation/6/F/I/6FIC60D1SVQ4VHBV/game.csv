"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",885000.0,Alice,5,
