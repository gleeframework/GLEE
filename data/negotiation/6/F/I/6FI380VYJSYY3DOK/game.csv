"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,800. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good value for the product. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,800 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really serious about buying this product, but my absolute top is $8,800. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. ",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,800 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,200. It's a bit of a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,5,
