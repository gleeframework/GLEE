Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, which could make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit higher than my budget, but I really like the product and think it's worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your needs. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $9,500 is a good deal and is much better than selling to John for $8,000.  It seems like further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely."
