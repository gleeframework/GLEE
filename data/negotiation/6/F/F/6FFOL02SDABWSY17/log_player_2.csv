{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting the negotiation with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will likely be rejected by Alice, but it establishes Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets a lower price point for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still above Bob's maximum price. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are still plenty of rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise but still remaining below his maximum price. This is a more reasonable counteroffer after Alice's previous offer.  It's a good strategy to gradually increase the offer while keeping the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still a little high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and  Bob can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final offer. It's at his maximum price, and any higher price is unacceptable. It's likely Alice will accept this, as it's close to her own valuation. If she rejects, Bob can simply go to John and buy the product for the same price."
