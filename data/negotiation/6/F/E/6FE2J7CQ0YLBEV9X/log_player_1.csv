"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is well above my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive by purchasing the product, hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $80, but I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter his offer to try and get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer of $100 is tempting, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer again."
