# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,400.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,400 is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's target price of $8,750.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down a bit more, even if it means more negotiation."
