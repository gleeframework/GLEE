Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?,950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $850000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while still being within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875000.  This price allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $925000, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, which would be $912500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $912500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $893750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",893750.0,Bob,6,
