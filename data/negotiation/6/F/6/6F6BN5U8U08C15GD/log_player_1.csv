"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* It leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 

By starting high, I'm signaling to Bob that I believe the product is valuable, and I'm hoping to secure a good price early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a better price.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach a deal that meets both of our needs.  John's offer is a sure thing and guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best choice at this point."
