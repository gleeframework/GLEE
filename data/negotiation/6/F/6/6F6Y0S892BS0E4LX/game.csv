"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a fair compromise. This price allows us both to get a good deal and ensures the transaction happens smoothly. Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,150,000 was too high, but I can do $1,130,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1130000.0,Alice,5,
