"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This still leaves a significant portion of the value on the table for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  While $1,050,000 is better, I'm still looking for a price closer to $950,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?  This allows both of us to make a fair deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
