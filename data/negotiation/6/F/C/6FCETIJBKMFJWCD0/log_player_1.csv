Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This still leaves a significant portion of the value on the table for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  While $1,050,000 is better, I'm still looking for a price closer to $950,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?  This allows both of us to make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob is clearly anchored around $950,000 and while there might be some room for negotiation, getting him to go significantly higher is unlikely. Accepting $1,000,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
