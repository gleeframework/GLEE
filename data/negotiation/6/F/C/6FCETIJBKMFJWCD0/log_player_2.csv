"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is closer to John's price than to your desired price range. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** You can likely negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This still leaves a significant portion of the value on the table for you.
