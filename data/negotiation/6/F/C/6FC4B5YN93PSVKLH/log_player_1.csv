Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
