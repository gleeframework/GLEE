"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference and settle on $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you while still leaving some room for profit for me. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,4,
