{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still within your budget, but it gives Alice some room to counter if she's willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. How about we compromise at $115? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's still a great deal for you.

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already made a concession to $115, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but that's as low as I can go.
