"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while being more competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and rejected a higher offer.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your increased offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Reason:  The negotiation has reached a point where the price is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate but isn't meeting Bob's desired price point.  Since Bob has 5 rounds left and wants to save as much as possible, buying the product from John for $1,200,000 is the most financially advantageous choice. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price within the remaining rounds."
