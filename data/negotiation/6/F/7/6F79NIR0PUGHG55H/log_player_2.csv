Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $8,000 to her, I'm willing to pay a bit more than half of that, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. Let's say... 

{""message"": ""I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $4,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $5,250 is still too low.  Let's settle on $6,500 and close the deal. This is a fair offer considering the product's true value.
