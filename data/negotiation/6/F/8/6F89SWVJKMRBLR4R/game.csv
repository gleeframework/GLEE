"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950000. This still offers you a substantial profit, while remaining within my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950000 is a good starting point, I need a price closer to $1100000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. This still offers you a significant profit, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see your point about the value, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1025000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit and move forward.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
