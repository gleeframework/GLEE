"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings me. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for you. You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Since your budget is $800,000, you can aim for a price closer to that. It's not worth accepting this offer yet."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $950,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering our respective budgets and the value you've explained. Let's reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
