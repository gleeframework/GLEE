Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $950,000. This price still reflects the product's significant value, and it gives us a chance to finalize a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice is still asking for too much. You can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but $850,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to your target, you can still potentially get a better price.  You're close to your limit, but you have more room to negotiate.  Continue with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  It's a fair offer that's closer to your price and allows us to both close this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that.  However,  $875,000 is still not enough for me to close this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500. This price gives us both a good deal and lets us close this negotiation.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to your limit. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject your counteroffer and you might have to buy from John at $800,000. Accepting her offer guarantees you get the product for a price close to your maximum budget."
