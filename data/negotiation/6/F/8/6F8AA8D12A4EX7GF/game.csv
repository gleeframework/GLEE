"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset that can significantly benefit your business. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $950,000. This price still reflects the product's significant value, and it gives us a chance to finalize a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to it.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but $850,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  It's a fair offer that's closer to your price and allows us to both close this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that.  However,  $875,000 is still not enough for me to close this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500. This price gives us both a good deal and lets us close this negotiation.  What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,7,
