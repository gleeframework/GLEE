Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset that can significantly benefit your business. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $950,000. This price still reflects the product's significant value, and it gives us a chance to finalize a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is still far below my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but $850,000 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  It's a fair offer that's closer to your price and allows us to both close this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that.  However,  $875,000 is still not enough for me to close this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500. This price gives us both a good deal and lets us close this negotiation.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
