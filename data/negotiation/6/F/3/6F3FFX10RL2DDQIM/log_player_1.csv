This initial offer is a starting point. It's slightly above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is below your minimum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
