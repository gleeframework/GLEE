"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save money, and $15,000 is above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  How about we start at $11,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he'd like to pay. He has a few rounds left and can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This way, we both get a fair deal and I can finally get my hands on this unique item."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $13500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's exclusivity and the value it brings to the buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his comfort zone.  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better deal from Alice is high.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John for $12,000."
