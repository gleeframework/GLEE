"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  How about we start at $11000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12500.  This way, we both get a fair deal and I can finally get my hands on this unique item.",12500.0,Bob,4,
