"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to achieve a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. 
* **Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, it's still a good deal for you.** You're getting it for $200,000 more than what it's worth to her, which is still a significant saving."
