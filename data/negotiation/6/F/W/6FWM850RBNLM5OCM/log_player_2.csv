"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still more than Alice's worth of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation to lower the price further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value of $800,000.  It represents a good starting point for further negotiation and shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product at a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point and well below John's offer of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer ensures a significant savings compared to buying from John and represents a good compromise."
