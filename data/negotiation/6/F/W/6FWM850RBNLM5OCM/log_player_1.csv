Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer gives Bob a significant discount while still leaving you with a substantial profit. It also leaves room for negotiation, as it's below Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that this price is fair given the value Bob places on the product."
