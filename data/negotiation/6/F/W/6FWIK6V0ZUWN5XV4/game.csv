"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value and potential. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
