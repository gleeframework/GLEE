"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $100?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and do $90.  That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we try $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want this product, but $95 is still pushing it for me. Let's meet in the middle again and go with $92.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $92.50, which would be $93.75. Can we meet at this price?",93.75,Alice,7,
