Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob's valuation is significantly lower, but there's a chance he might pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high starting price allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The safety net of selling to John at $10,000 reduces risk, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., very price-sensitive), you might adjust the initial offer.
* **Product Uniqueness:** If the product is highly unique and Bob might struggle to find it elsewhere, a higher price is more justifiable."
