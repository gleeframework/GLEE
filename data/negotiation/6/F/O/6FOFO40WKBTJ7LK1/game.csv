"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth.  $9,200 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $9,300.  Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement. ",9300.0,Alice,7,
