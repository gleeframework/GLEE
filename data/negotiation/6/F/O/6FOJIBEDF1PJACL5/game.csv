"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $925,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $920,000? That's the best I can do.",920000.0,Bob,4,
