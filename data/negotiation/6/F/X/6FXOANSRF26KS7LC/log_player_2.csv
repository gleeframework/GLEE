While $850,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than your absolute limit.  You're in a good position because you have a backup option with John.  Let's try to squeeze Alice down just a bit more."

You have successfully negotiated with Alice to get a price that is close to your ideal price of $800,000. However, it is important to remember that your absolute limit is $800,000. If you reject this offer and try to negotiate further, there is no guarantee that Alice will agree to a lower price, and you might end up with no deal at all. Therefore, it is better to go with your backup option and buy the product from John for $800,000."
