Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's important to understand that:

* **This is a negotiation:** We're trying to get the best price possible, but we need to be aware of Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **We have an alternative:** John is offering us $1,000,000, so we shouldn't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offers are too low.
* **Communication matters:**  Being clear and respectful will help us achieve a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am hoping to negotiate a lower price. Would you consider selling the product for $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

We're rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than our minimum desired price. We're going to counter with our own offer,  hoping to get closer to our target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $960,000 is less than our ideal price of $1,000,000, it's close enough to our minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000 and offers a compromise.  We're willing to take this deal to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
