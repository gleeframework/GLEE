Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000 but still allows for room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and optimistic. It highlights the value of the product for Bob, which could encourage him to accept the offer. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:** This price gives Bob a good deal, increasing his chances of accepting. 
* **Keep options open:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still negotiate with him further or go to John for my minimum price. 
* **Build rapport:** A friendly message can create a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000, and even lower than the $10,000 I initially offered.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that's less than my minimum.  I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a tempting offer, it's unfortunately not enough for me to consider selling.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on a price of $9,500. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I'm confident we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. It shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum price.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly but firm. I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my minimum price, emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the counteroffer.  

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain my position:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price too far below my minimum.
* **Increase the chances of agreement:** By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to encourage him to accept this offer. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** It avoids a quick rejection and keeps the possibility of a deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'd love to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to compromise below my minimum of $12,000.  

John has already offered me my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome, so I'll choose to go with him."
