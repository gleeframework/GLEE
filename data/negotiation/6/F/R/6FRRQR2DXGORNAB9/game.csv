"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the product's features. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $700000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $820000. It's a good balance between what I'm looking for and what you're willing to pay. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $820000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $820000, so I'm offering $810000. Can you consider that?",810000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $815000. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
