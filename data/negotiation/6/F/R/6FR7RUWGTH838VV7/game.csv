"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
