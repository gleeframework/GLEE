Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a better price.  $8,250 is still more than what the product is worth to him. There's room for a counteroffer and a chance to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance service. I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his maximum budget. The product is worth $8,000 to him, and Alice's offer with extras is $8,200. While Alice is adding some extras, the price is still over his budget. 

It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. He saves $200 and gets the product within his budget."
