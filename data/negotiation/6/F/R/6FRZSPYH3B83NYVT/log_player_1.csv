Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm happy to move forward, but I'd need to see a price closer to $900,000 for it to work for my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
