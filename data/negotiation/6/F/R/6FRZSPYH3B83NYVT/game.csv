"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm happy to move forward, but I'd need to see a price closer to $900,000 for it to work for my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
