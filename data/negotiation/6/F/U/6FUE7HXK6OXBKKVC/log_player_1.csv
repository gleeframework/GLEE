Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit. This also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $16,000 is still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a little below my initial goal, it's closer to my minimum value and the negotiations seem to be stuck.  It's better to close the deal now and avoid the risk of further rejection and having to sell to John for a lower price."
