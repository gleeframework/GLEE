"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and my original offer reflects that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, so I'm making a counteroffer of $857,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",857500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However,  $857,500 is still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $890,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, reflecting the true value of what I'm offering.  Let me know if this works for you.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $800,000. I'm willing to make one last offer of $800,000. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
