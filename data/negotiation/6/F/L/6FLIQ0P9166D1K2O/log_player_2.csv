{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't budge below $108. It's highly unlikely she'll drastically change her price in one round.  You've reached an impasse. Rather than risk getting stuck with no deal and potentially paying John's higher price, it's more strategic to buy from John now for $150.  While not ideal, it's better than potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
