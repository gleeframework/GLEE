"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $80 is way too low. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I could potentially do $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $95.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm trying to keep this purchase under $100.  Would you be willing to meet me at $100 even?",100.0,Bob,6,
