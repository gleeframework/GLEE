**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer and seems unlikely to move significantly higher.  While you might be able to squeeze a few hundred dollars more out of him, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. You have a guaranteed offer for $12,000 from John, which meets your minimum price. It's time to take the sure thing."
