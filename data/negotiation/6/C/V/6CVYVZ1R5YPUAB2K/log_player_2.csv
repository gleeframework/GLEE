"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $16,000. It's a great deal, as the product is worth at least $15,000 to you. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and higher than what John is offering. You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
