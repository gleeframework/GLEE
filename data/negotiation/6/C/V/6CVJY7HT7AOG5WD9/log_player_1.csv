Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you're above your minimum if he accepts outright. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
