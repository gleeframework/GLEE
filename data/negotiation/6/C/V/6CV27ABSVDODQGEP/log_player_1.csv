{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still being attractive to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,200? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11200}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to accept his offer of $11,000 since it's a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired outcome."
