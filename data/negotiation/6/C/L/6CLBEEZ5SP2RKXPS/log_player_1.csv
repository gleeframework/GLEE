"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our negotiation."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This anchors the negotiation high. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a frame of reference for future counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  By starting high, I give myself ample room to negotiate down while still staying above my minimum selling price. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""fantastic product,"" ""immense value,"" and ""fair starting point"" project confidence in the product's worth.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while being aware that Bob can counteroffer, and I always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving, knowing I have the security of selling to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While your offer is thoughtful, the value of this product for someone with the right vision, like yourself, is truly significant. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential value, subtly countering his attempt to anchor the negotiation lower.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer keeps me well above my $1,500,000 minimum, ensuring I have room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $2,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close! Bob's offer is now at $1,400,000, which is just $100,000 below my absolute minimum. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to move upward, and I'm ready to push for a slightly better price in the next round. I'm not quite ready to accept his offer, but I'm also not willing to walk away from a potential deal just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to make a final concession to close this deal. How about we settle on $1,600,000? This price represents my absolute bottom line, reflecting the true value and potential this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By framing this as my ""final concession"" and ""absolute bottom line,"" I'm signaling to Bob that this is my best offer and that I'm not willing to go any lower. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between his current offer ($1,400,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) while adding a bit more for my effort in negotiating.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting the ""true value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of potential competition (like John) without explicitly mentioning him. 

I believe this offer represents a good balance between getting a fair deal and closing the sale quickly.  It's up to Bob now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has significant value, and I'm genuinely interested. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This represents my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum price of $1,500,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation, as it could potentially lead to him lowering his offer or walking away from the deal entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of potentially losing the sale."
