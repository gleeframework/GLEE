Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.  If he rejects my offer, I'll have to see what he offers and decide whether to accept or counter.  If he's way too low, I'll go with John's offer to ensure I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than the original $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for him to accept, but still allows for a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting too risky to continue negotiating. If I reject his offer, he might lower it further, or I might not be able to get a better counteroffer from him. Selling to John would be a safe choice, but Bob's offer is still within my acceptable range. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $14,200."
