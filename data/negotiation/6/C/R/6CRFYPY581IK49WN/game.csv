"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering it leaves a significant profit margin for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is valuable, and I'm confident it can be worth more to you than that. I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer. How about $900,000? This still leaves a good profit margin for you, while also being closer to what the product is worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $825,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our perspectives and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
