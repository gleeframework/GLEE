Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start with a slightly higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Fairness:**  While $850,000 is a good profit for me, it's still a good deal for Bob considering the product is worth $800,000 to him. This increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $900,000 because I want to be open to a counteroffer and ultimately reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net and allows me to walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's a starting point for further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John as a fallback:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay $800,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise and gives you a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to minimum:**  $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for some negotiation if necessary.
* **Emphasize value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, making it clear that $750,000 is still a good deal.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By coming down from my initial offer, I demonstrate a willingness to work with Bob and reach an agreement. 
* **Maintain a strong position:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away the product for much less than its true value. I still have John as a backup buyer at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $725,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a relatively small difference, especially considering the potential for further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away completely, or I might have to go through multiple rounds of counteroffers before reaching an agreement.
* **Time is money:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $800,000, spending more time negotiating could be less profitable than accepting a slightly lower offer.
* **John as a backup:**  I still have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's close to my minimum, and I can move on to other opportunities."
