"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without risking him going to John.  I believe this leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to get at least $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile.  I will counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still significantly higher than John's offer. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, and we can close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better deal from Bob. I will counteroffer, hoping to close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to make a final concession, dropping my offer to $1,250,000. This is still above John's offer and, hopefully,  enticing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I've already made significant concessions. We're running out of time, and  I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
