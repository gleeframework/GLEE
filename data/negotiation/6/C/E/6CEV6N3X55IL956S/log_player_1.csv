Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value, and it's a starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm prepared to go lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a bit above my minimum, but it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's low offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $14,000 is only slightly below my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point.  Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I'm hoping for a quick sale and don't want to risk Bob rejecting my counteroffer and walking away."
