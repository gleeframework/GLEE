Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential and market value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield substantial returns for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,500,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  We're early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, I believe this product's unique value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly anchored around the $1,600,000 mark. While I could push for more, accepting ensures a $400,000 profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of losing Bob altogether."
