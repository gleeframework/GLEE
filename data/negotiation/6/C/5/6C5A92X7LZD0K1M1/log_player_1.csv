Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you.

This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.
