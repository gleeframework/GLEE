"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you and the effort I put into acquiring it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which reflects the value I place on the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
