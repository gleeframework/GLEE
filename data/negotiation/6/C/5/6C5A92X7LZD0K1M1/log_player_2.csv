"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above your ideal price point, but you have 10 rounds to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still offers a decent profit for her, as her value is $1,000,000. 
* **Strong justification:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob and the potential profit for Alice, making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob will have a better understanding of her bottom line and can adjust his strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you and the effort I put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your target:** Alice's counteroffer is still $50,000 higher than your ideal price point.  You're aiming for a price below $1,000,000, so it's not yet time to accept. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has responded. This shows that negotiations are happening, and there's room for further compromise. 
* **Time to adjust:** Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  You can likely push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects the value I place on the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your target:**  This counteroffer gets you closer to your desired price point of below $1,000,000.
