"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this opportunity. I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I've analyzed similar products and market trends, and I'm confident that its worth is much higher.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects both the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still significantly beyond my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's potential while remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm eager to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the ballpark, it's still a significant gap from what I consider fair market value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
