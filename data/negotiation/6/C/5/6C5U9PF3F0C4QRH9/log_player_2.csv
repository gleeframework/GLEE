Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I've analyzed similar products and market trends, and I'm confident that its worth is much higher.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects both the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for Bob.  He should reject the offer and make another counteroffer.  It's possible Alice is willing to come down further, and he doesn't want to miss that opportunity."

I'm eager to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the ballpark, it's still a significant gap from what I consider fair market value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring the product's value is recognized. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. At this point, Bob should go with the safer option and purchase the product from John for $800,000.  There's a risk that Alice will keep counter-offering, and Bob might end up paying more than he wants. Buying from John guarantees the lowest price within Bob's budget."
