Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for this product. It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
