Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify going above $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final offer."
