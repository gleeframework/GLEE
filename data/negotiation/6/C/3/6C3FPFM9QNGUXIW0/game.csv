"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. Let's make it happen!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $120. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
