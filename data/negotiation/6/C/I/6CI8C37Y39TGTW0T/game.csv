"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $22000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $22000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $20000 and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, $21000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $20500, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",20500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $22000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20500 and $22000, so I'll sell the product to you for $21250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",21250.0,Alice,7,
