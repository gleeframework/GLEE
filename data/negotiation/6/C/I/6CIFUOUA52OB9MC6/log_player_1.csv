"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a good deal, I'm still aiming for closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm adjusting my price down to $12,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise while still getting a price that is fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, and we are already in round 4. While I'd prefer $12,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
