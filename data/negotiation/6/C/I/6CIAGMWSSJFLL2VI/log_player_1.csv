I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than what I would get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
