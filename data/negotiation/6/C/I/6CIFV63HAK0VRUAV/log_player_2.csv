Alice is now offering a price that's within my budget, but I'm still not quite ready to accept. I'm hoping to see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $100.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the best price Alice has offered so far, and with only one round left, it's likely I won't get a better price. I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint and don't want to risk missing out on the product altogether. While $130 is still more than my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
