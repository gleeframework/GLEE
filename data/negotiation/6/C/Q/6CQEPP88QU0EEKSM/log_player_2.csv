Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll be happy with the price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, there's a significant chance she won't go any lower. At this point, the potential savings of $50,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the certainty of getting the product for $1,000,000 from John. It makes more sense to secure the product at a known, acceptable price from John."
