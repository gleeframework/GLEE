Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth more than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's feedback, making him feel more comfortable engaging in the negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then propose a lower price, potentially around $13,500, before ultimately accepting John's offer of $12,000."
