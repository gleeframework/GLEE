"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
