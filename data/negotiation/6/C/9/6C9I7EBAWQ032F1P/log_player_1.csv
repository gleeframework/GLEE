{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting at $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves me with a good profit margin.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for his business and framing it as a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly inviting Bob to respond, showing my willingness to negotiate. 

This initial offer sets a strong starting point while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is hesitant. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low to consider.  

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that is closer to my desired value. I'm also keeping in mind that selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a significant compromise by dropping my price from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.  
* **Positive Tone:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both parties.

This counteroffer balances my need to earn a reasonable amount with the desire to maintain a good relationship with Bob and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is coming closer to my minimum, $1,150,000 is still below my acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a reliable backup buyer in John.  It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and secure a higher price.  

I will make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap further and get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's finalize this and get things moving."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my last offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,150,000). This demonstrates a genuine desire to find a compromise and shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Finality Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reframing my counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution, highlighting the positive aspects of reaching an agreement. 

This counteroffer presents a fair and reasonable compromise that is likely to be attractive to Bob while still allowing me to achieve my minimum acceptable price."
