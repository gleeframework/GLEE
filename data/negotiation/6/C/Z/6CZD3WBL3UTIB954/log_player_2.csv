"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still reflects the significant worth of the product, while offering some room for compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down $100,000, which is a good sign. However, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's unique value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This is a fair price that respects both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to John's price. While $1,250,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to push slightly beyond it if it means getting a better deal than John offers. I'll counter-offer just below my absolute maximum to see if Alice will bite."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I could do $1,190,000. That's really stretching my budget, though."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to go down to $1,225,000.  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping it will be acceptable to you.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower and is now only $25,000 away from John's price. The potential savings aren't worth the risk of continued negotiation. It's time to buy from John."
