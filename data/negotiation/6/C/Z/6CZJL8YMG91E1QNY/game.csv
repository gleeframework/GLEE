"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making compromises, and I appreciate that.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you consider $1,250,000?  It splits the difference and might be a good point for us to agree.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
