Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if Bob is unwilling to meet my price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a more attractive option right now.
* **Negotiation Potential:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. There's still a chance I can find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000.  If he rejects that, I'll reassess my options based on how much he's willing to budge.  However, I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John if I feel the negotiation isn't leading to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Justification:** I provide a justification for my price, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000. I'll consider how much Bob's counteroffers reflect his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation is starting to get drawn out, and I'm not confident I can push Bob much higher.
* **John's Offer:**  With John's offer of $12,000, I'm getting closer to my minimum value and am not losing much by walking away from this deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, likely around $9,200, to see if we can reach a compromise. However, if he rejects that, I'll move forward and sell the product to John for $12,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,200?  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final attempt to find a middle ground. I've moved closer to Bob's price but still maintained a reasonable margin. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000.  This final counteroffer is my last attempt to get a better price from Bob, but I won't risk settling for a price that is too low."
