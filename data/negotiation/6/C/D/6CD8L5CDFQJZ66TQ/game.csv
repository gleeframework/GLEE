"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9200?  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested!",9200.0,Alice,5,
