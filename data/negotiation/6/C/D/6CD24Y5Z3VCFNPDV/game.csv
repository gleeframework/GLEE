"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, my budget allows me to only pay up to $1150000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, thank you for your response. My budget is quite tight, and I'm not able to increase the offer beyond $1200000. I hope this meets your expectations, and we can move forward with the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
