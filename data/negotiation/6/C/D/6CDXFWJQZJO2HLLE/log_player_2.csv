"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you can get the product for $10,000 from John if you reject it. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting this offer and buying from John makes more sense."
