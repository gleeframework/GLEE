"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This leaves room for concessions while anchoring the price in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth without being too aggressive.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the negotiation far above both his valuation and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum valuation, leaving us no room for negotiation. While accepting would close the deal, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $300,000 more. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Dropping $200,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value without directly refuting Bob's valuation, aiming to keep the negotiation positive.

This counteroffer keeps us in the game and applies pressure on Bob to justify his significantly lower valuation if he chooses to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increasing his offer suggests he's willing to negotiate beyond his initial valuation, which is encouraging. However, $1,600,000 is still less than John's guaranteed offer. We are also still in early rounds, and declining might push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your revised offer demonstrates your understanding of the product's potential. To meet you halfway, let's settle at $1,700,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my initial price."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer directly addresses Bob's movement by meeting him exactly in the middle of the previous offers. It highlights fairness and encourages a deal.
* **Compromise Emphasis:**  Phrasing it as a ""significant compromise"" reminds Bob of our concessions while framing the price as attractive. 

We're getting close to John's offer, so the next round will be crucial in deciding whether to continue with Bob or take the guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Difference:**  Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is only $50,000 less than ours and $150,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might risk Bob walking away, especially as we've both significantly moved from our initial positions.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds. 

While we could push for the extra $50,000, the risk of losing the current offer outweighs the potential gain. Accepting this offer secures a good price and concludes the negotiation successfully."
