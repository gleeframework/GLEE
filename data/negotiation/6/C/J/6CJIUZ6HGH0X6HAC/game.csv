"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but $10,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While I understand the value, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a compromise for me, but I'm willing to try to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  $14,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Could you do $13,000? I think that's a fair offer considering we've both moved on price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. However, $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,500, which is the lowest I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",14500.0,Alice,7,
