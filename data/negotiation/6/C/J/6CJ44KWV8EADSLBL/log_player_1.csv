"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100, a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport by mentioning the value to Bob and framing the offer as a good deal. 
* **Strategy:** By starting high, I have room to negotiate down if needed.  However, if Bob rejects quickly, I can switch to John without losing much."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.

* I have 9 rounds left, so I have time to explore a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $95, which is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing willingness to compromise, while still highlighting the value of the product.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and positions me to potentially close the deal in the next round. If Bob rejects, I can still accept John's offer for $80, but I'm aiming for a higher price."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a slightly higher price.
* **Reasoning:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell yet. If I reject Bob's offer, I can potentially get a better price in the next few rounds.

**Strategy:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to bridge the gap in price with another counteroffer.  While I could sell to John for $80, I'm aiming for a bit more profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $90, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise and create a sense of fairness.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and positions me to potentially close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects, I can still accept John's offer for $80, but I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm nearing my minimum threshold, so it's crucial to close a deal or consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $87 is just $7 below my desired price of $94, but it's still above my minimum of $80.
* **Reasoning:**  I only have 4 rounds left. It's getting risky to continue rejecting offers. 
* **Strategy:** I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer. While I could potentially get a higher price in the remaining rounds, the risk of not closing a deal and being forced to sell to John for $80 is too high. Accepting $87 ensures a profit and minimizes the risk."
