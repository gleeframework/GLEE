"I'm really interested in the product, but $2500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2500000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $2200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",2200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1900000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at that price.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, I'm still not willing to go below $2000000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $1980000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I hope you'll consider it.",1980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a small concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with the current offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1900000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a condition: if you accept this price, I'll also ask you to throw in some additional support or services related to the product. This could be training, maintenance, or something else that would make the product more valuable to me. If you're willing to include that, I'd be happy to accept this price.",1900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your condition, Bob, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to include any additional services or support for free. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount on the price, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair value for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1950000, and I'll throw in a one-time consultation session to help you get started with the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
