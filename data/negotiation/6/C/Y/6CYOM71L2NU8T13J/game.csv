"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000. This is the highest I can go, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  I've looked more closely at the potential applications for you, and I'm confident this product can deliver even greater returns on your investment than you initially anticipated. To find middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This price reflects the significant long-term value this product will bring to your operations.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the potential benefits you mentioned, $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a fair price, but I can't go beyond my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a firm number for me.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position and your commitment to finding a fair deal. I've been giving this careful thought, and to make this work, I'm willing to offer a compromise.  If you agree to $1,450,000, I'm prepared to include a significant bonus package that directly addresses your needs and maximizes the product's value for you.  This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it presents a win-win scenario for both of us. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and the bonus package is an interesting addition. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and it's a price that makes this deal worthwhile for both of us. I'm confident we can find a way to make this work if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
