# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $950000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $875,000, which is still a good deal for you.  You could try to negotiate further, but the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer at $875,000 is a good compromise and saves you a significant amount compared to John's price."
