"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's** ($9,500 < $10,000), but you can still do better.
* **You're willing to pay up to $10,000**, so you have room to negotiate.  
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage** to potentially get a lower price from Alice or force her to consider selling it to John."
