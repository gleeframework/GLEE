"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. It's a great deal, considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. That being said, $9,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering John is offering it for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $10,000 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
