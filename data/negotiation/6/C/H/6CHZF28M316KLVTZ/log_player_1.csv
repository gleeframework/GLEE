Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also leaving some space for a potential profit, which I'm hoping to maximize through this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating. I'm willing to accept a lower profit than my initial goal, but not that low. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a comfortable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a worse outcome."
