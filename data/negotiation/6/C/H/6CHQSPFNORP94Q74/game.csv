"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but I believe this product is truly worth $1,300,000. It's a significant investment that will pay off for you in the long run.  Let's just bridge the gap a little bit â€“ how about $1,280,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the product being a significant investment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer, but $1,225,000 is still a little too low for me. Given the product's value and the potential benefits for you, I'm willing to go down to $1,240,000 as a final compromise.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, so let me know if you're willing to accept this. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1240000.0,Alice,7,
