```

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and still below my minimum acceptable value. It's too early to accept his offer.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Value Reminder:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and the long-term benefits for Bob.
* **Finality:** I'm phrasing this offer as a potential final compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the product being a significant investment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While selling to John is a tempting option, I'm not yet ready to give up on Bob. I believe there's still potential for negotiation, and I'm willing to try one more counter-offer to see if we can reach a compromise.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer, but $1,225,000 is still a little too low for me. Given the product's value and the potential benefits for you, I'm willing to go down to $1,240,000 as a final compromise.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, so let me know if you're willing to accept this. If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1240000}
```

* **Compromise:** I'm making a small concession but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes offer. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept. If not, I'll be ready to move on to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. It's clear we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  At this point, with only two rounds left, I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, the risk of further negotiation is too high. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable value and avoids potentially losing out on a better deal."
