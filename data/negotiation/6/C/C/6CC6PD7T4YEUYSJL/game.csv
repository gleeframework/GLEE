"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. ",16500.0,Alice,5,
