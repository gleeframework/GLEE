"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I need to negotiate to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to secure a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,250,000, a price that I think is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay more than my initial counteroffer of $1,150,000, but I'm not ready to accept $1,250,000 yet. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,220,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is within my budget and represents a good deal. It's only slightly higher than my counteroffer of $1,200,000 and a significant savings compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy for me."
