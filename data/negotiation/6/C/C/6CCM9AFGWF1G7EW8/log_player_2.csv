"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations or personal projects. Given its high quality and unique features, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I am offering this exceptional product to you for $15000. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. Since you can get the product for the same price from John, there's no reason to risk negotiating further. You could potentially get a lower price from Alice, but there's also the risk she'll reject your counteroffer and you'll be left with nothing.  It's safer to go with the guaranteed deal from John."
