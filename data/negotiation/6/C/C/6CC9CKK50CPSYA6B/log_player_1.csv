"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while leaving space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $70? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to push Bob closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $70 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
