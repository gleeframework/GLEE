Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make more than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is now closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer more, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $80. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
