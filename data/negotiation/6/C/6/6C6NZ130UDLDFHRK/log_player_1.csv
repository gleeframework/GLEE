"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it allows for some room for negotiation and hopefully entices Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point. I believe it's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I would have liked to get a better price from Bob, it's clear he's not willing to budge much further.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  I'm happy with this outcome."
