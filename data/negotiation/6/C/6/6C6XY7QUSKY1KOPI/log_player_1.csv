"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,750,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's start with this offer and see where we can go from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true value of this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000. There's room to negotiate further and try to bridge the gap before accepting a lower price or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my $1,500,000 minimum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed offer from John to avoid potentially lower offers from Bob in the remaining rounds."
