This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has stated this is her lowest price. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, she is unlikely to go any lower.
* **Bob's Goal:** Bob wanted to pay no more than $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves him $300,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could annoy Alice, and there's no guarantee she won't become more firm on her $1,200,000 price."
