"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true scarcity and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my price range.  To make this work, I'm offering $900,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in the product. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value we both see in it.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who's offering $1,000,000.  However, I believe in giving you every opportunity.  If you can meet that price, the product is yours.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
