"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option to try and get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $170 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 125}
