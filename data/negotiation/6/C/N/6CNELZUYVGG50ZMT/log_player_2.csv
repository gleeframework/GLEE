{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a lower price than her standard pricing, it's still not within your acceptable range. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price or explore your other option of buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. In light of your offer, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still ensuring a fair return for us. We hope this aligns better with your budget and look forward to your consideration.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still above your budget of $1,200,000.

This ensures a guaranteed purchase within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially failing."
