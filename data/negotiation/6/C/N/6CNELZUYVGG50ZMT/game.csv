"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,350,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,250,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product would be a valuable asset for my business.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
