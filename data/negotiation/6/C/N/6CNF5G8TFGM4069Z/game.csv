"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,225,000. Can you consider that price?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
