Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The $1,100,000 price allows for potential negotiation down to a price that is still acceptable to me (above my minimum of $1,200,000). 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll always be mindful of my minimum price ($1,200,000) and my backup option (John).
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive or takes too long, I'm ready to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding a quick sell:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm willing to risk a bit more time to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while remaining realistic and keeping the negotiation amicable. 
* I'll carefully consider Bob's budget and motivation when crafting my counteroffer.
* If Bob continues to be stubborn or the negotiation drags on, I'll switch gears and sell to John to secure the guaranteed amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product is worth a bit more to me, and I'm confident it's worth a bit more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That gives us both some room to compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **""Meeting in the middle"":**  By framing it as a meeting point, I'm suggesting a fair and reasonable solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential benefit to him.
* **Keeping it Positive:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we finalize the deal. 
* If he rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to counter again or move on to John.
* I'll keep in mind my minimum price ($1,200,000) and the time factor, as I don't want to get stuck in endless negotiation."
