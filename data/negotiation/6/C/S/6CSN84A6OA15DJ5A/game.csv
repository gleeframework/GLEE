"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product is worth a bit more to me, and I'm confident it's worth a bit more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That gives us both some room to compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
