"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for a lower price since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's already offering it for $1,100,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product is worth a bit more to me, and I'm confident it's worth a bit more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That gives us both some room to compromise, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than her initial offer and only slightly higher than what you'd pay to John.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice might walk away, and you'd end up paying more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
