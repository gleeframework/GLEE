"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify spending $11,000 on it. Would you consider reducing the price to $9,500? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? This price still allows me to make a profit, while giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'll try to come closer to your last offer. How about $10,000 for the product? It's the highest I can go, considering its value to me. I hope this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
