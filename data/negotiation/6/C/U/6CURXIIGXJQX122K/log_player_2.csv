"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is far above Bob's budget. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

Bob should start by offering the maximum price he's willing to pay. This sets a clear boundary and potentially sparks further negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his ideal range. Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget.  This is a good strategy to signal commitment while not revealing his absolute maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he's still got some room to negotiate. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further if Bob rejects her offer.  He's also still well within his 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into a decision just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should continue to slowly increase his offer, but stay within his budget.  The goal is to get Alice to meet him in the middle, and a small increase shows his willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his ideal range. He has a few rounds left and could potentially get a better price if he continues to negotiate.  It's worth trying to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but still has some room to negotiate. Offering $975,000 demonstrates his willingness to meet Alice halfway, while also staying within his budget. This move could potentially convince Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's down to the wire! Bob has one round left with Alice, but her offer is still above his budget. He has a few options:

* **Accept the offer:** This would save him some time but would be a financially unfavorable decision.
* **Counteroffer:** It's unlikely Alice will accept a counteroffer at this stage, especially as this is the final round.
* **Buy from John:** This is the best option. While not the lowest price, it's within Bob's budget and ensures he gets the product. 

It's important to remember Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and losing the product is too high. Buying from John guarantees he gets the product and stays within his budget."
