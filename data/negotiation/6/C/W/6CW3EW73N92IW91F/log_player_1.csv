"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but not outrageous. I'll gauge Bob's interest based on his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $135, which is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the sale now for $135 than to gamble and potentially end up selling to John for $100."
