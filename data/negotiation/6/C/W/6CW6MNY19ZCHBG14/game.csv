,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? ",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. ",90.0,Bob,4,
