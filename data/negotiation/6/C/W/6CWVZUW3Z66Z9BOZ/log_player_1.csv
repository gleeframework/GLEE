"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it has tremendous value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's ""tremendous value"" without specifics keeps Bob curious and open to the idea of a high price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $800,000 on top of the profit I want, giving Bob the opportunity to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This approach balances a strong opening offer with a willingness to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to hold out for a better price.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  $950,000 is a good starting point for further negotiation. 
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price:** I believe there's room to get closer to my desired profit by making a counteroffer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can control the negotiation and try to secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something a little closer to my asking price.  How about $975,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm not giving in completely and still aiming for a price above $950,000.
* **Emphasizing value again:** Reminding Bob of the product's potential keeps the focus on the value proposition, not just the price. 

This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to consider a deal closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $960000. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and the difference is now relatively small.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  
* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement. 

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal to a lower price or missing the deadline."
