"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows me to meet my own financial needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  There's a chance we can close the deal at a price I'm comfortable with, and I don't want to miss out on the potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm  willing to meet you at $1,450,000. It's a compromise on my end, but I'm confident this price still reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the negotiations have stalled, and I'm running out of time.  John is a sure thing, and I need to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
