"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value to you is higher than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $900,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks or support to sweeten the deal?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added perks, but I'm still looking for a lower price. How about we settle on $880,000? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
