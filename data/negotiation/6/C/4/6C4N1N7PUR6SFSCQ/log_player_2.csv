"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering a price significantly lower than the product's worth to her. This indicates there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price.**  This means buying from Alice still saves Bob money.
* **The offer is a good compromise.**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  
* **There's no guarantee a further counteroffer would be successful.**  Alice might be unwilling to go lower, and Bob could end up paying more than $950,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice, as it allows Bob to buy the product for a price lower than John's and avoids the risk of further negotiations leading to a higher price."
