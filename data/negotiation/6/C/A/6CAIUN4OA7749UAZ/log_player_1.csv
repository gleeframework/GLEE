Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, providing a reason like ""significant value"" might make him reconsider.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiation is highly context-dependent. Factors like your relationship with Bob, your understanding of his negotiation style, and the product's uniqueness could influence a different approach."
