"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
