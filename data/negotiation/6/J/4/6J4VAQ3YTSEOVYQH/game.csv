"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession to get us to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I meet my minimum value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still pushing my budget.  My final offer is $10,500. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to squeeze the last bit of savings out of the deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but no lower. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,7,
