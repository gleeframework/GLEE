Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than $10,000, making the offer to Bob less risky."
