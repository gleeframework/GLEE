```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $12,000 in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $1,500 less than what he's willing to pay. However, it's also significantly closer to my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000.  This is the last offer I'm willing to make before considering selling to John.  I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's willingness to pay and my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd like to get more from Bob, we're now in round 6 and Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable.  It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point, as I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price by selling to John."
