"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close! I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $110. How about we try $125? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
