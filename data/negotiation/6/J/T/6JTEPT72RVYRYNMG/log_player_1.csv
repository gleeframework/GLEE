Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and demand, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for potential negotiation if he's interested but finds the price too high.

**Important:** It's crucial to remember that this is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You might need to adjust your approach based on his response."
