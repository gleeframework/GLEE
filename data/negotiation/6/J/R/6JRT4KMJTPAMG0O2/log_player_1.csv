(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $85 is too low for me, and I think I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I believe $87 would be a fair price for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $87 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $90. I'll see if I can push a little harder in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about $89? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering your last offer, I think $88 would be a reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $88.  It's still a good price for me, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  There's always a chance that I could get a counteroffer in the next round, but it's not worth the risk of losing out on this sale completely."
