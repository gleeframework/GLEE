"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a good deal compared to the product's value to you, it's still not worth paying extra.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above your budget. While it's a better deal than her initial offer, it's not worth paying extra.  You've already stated your maximum budget, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the most cost-effective option."
