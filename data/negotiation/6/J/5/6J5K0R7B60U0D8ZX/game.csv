"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't afford $18,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not able to meet at $14,000. I'd like to propose $12,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll need to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
