"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the maximum profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't afford $18,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum goal of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not able to meet at $14,000. I'd like to propose $12,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum goal, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer Bob again, but I'm getting close to considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer and I'm willing to go up to $12,500 for the product. This is the highest I can afford without exceeding my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum goal of $15,000, and we are only on round 6. I'm getting close to my limit of rounds and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob. John is a guaranteed sale for a price that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid the risk of losing out on a good deal with Bob."
