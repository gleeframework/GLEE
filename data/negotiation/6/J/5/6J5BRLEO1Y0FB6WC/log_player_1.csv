Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $650,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to me. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $675,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough considering the product's value to me.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $800,000 from John."
