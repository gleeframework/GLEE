"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could go up to $650,000.  It's a fair offer.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $650,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $675,000? It seems like a fair compromise.",675000.0,Bob,6,
