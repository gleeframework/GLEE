Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant investment.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
