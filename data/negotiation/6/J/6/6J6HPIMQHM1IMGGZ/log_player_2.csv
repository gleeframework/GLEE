"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This suggests she has room to negotiate.  I will counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant investment."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  I will counteroffer again, aiming to stay closer to my initial offer of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced that we've reached the optimal price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I could continue to negotiate,  it's getting risky.  There are only 5 rounds left, and if I reject this offer, Alice might not make any further concessions.  Also, I risk losing the product entirely if I reach round 10 and haven't reached an agreement.  

Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
