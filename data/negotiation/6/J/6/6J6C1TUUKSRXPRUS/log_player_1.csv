Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $175. That's a significant reduction from my initial price and a fair price for this great product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair compromise,  and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $100 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to make this work, I really do want to buy the product!  What do you think?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  I'm going to have to push my budget a bit to get this product, so my final offer is $115.  This is the highest I can go, so if it doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've made a lot of concessions already, and I'm not willing to drop below my threshold.  John is a reliable buyer, and I can secure a guaranteed $150 which is better than the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
