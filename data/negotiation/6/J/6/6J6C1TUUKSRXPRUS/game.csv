"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $175. That's a significant reduction from my initial price and a fair price for this great product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair compromise,  and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $100 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make this happen!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to make this work, I really do want to buy the product!  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. Let's close this deal! ",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  I'm going to have to push my budget a bit to get this product, so my final offer is $115.  This is the highest I can go, so if it doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,8,
