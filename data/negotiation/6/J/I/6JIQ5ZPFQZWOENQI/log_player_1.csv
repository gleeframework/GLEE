Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  $175 is a reasonable starting point that allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he's willing to pay this much, great! If not, we can negotiate.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a solid floor for negotiations. I won't accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it, which is within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Bob is willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **John is a backup.**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I don't have to settle for a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $140 is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product by suggesting it's still a good deal for Bob at $140. 
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would $130 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the risk of a stalemate is high.
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating further could take more time and energy.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of a lower price.  

It's important to consider the value of my time and the potential for a long negotiation with Bob.  In this case, a guaranteed profit with John is the most practical and efficient decision."
