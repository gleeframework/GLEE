"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility. I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to reach a deal.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $1,180,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
