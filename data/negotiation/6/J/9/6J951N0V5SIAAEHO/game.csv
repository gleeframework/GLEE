"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",12200.0,Alice,5,
