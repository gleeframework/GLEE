Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's perception of value.
* **Backup Plan:**  It's essential to remember that John provides a safety net at $800,000.  Therefore, Alice doesn't need to go below that price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's below his perceived value."
