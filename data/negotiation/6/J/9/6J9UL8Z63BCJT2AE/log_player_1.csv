Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your $120 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $65 is far too low. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below Bob's perceived value of $80.  There's no reason to accept such a low price. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price or sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

This counteroffer still leaves room for negotiation but is closer to your minimum acceptable price. It shows you are willing to compromise but also that you value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is still a bit much for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to your minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your acceptable range. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price, potentially closer to $90, or simply sell to John for $120. Selling to John guarantees you a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate further.
* **Still above your minimum:** It ensures you make a profit while still being competitive.
* **Gives a reason for the price:**  Highlighting the product's value justifies the price point."
