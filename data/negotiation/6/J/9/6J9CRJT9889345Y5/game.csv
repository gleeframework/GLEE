"I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $14000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer you a price of $13500. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, so I'll make one more serious offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm willing to make a deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll include a free additional service that's worth $500. This brings the total value to $14000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,9,
