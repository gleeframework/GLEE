Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $115. This is a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and confident. I highlight the value of the product and avoid mentioning my minimum price, allowing for more flexibility in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and will likely counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $110. This price is halfway between my initial offer of $115 and Bob's counteroffer of $105. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my desire for a higher price. I use positive language like ""fair price"" and ""walk away happy"" to maintain a friendly tone and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $107.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to go any lower than $120. I'm confident that John will pay my full asking price, and I'm ready to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that may not result in a better offer."
