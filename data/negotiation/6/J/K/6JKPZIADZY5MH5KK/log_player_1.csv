Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to find a price that's appealing to Bob (above his valuation) but also maximizes your potential profit.

**Possible Strategy:**

Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed amount can create a sense of urgency and potential ""loss"" for Bob if he declines.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I finalize a deal with another buyer.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident the other buyer will accept my full asking price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Why this might work:**

* **Urgency:** The message implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly.
* **Perceived Discount:**  Bob sees a price lower than your guaranteed amount, potentially making it seem like a bargain.
* **Justification:**  You've provided a reason (another buyer) for the ""discount"" and the limited-time offer.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer or strategy based on Bob's response."
