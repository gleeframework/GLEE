Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $78 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $81 and $78. How about we settle at $79.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but unlikely to go lower than $79.5. Taking the offer now secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
