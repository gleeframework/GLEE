Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure Bob is willing to meet my minimum price.  Even though he's expressed interest, he keeps offering prices below my desired level. To avoid further negotiation and potential losses, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum price."
