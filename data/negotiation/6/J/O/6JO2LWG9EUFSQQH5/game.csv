"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to keep the deal going. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
