"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase [product name] for a price that will significantly benefit your company.  While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I can assure you that this product is worth far more than the price I'm offering. I believe a fair price for both of us would be $1,200,000. This allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted rate, while still ensuring I receive a significant return on my investment.  Consider this your exclusive window to acquire [product name] at this price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can still do better.  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000.  This means you can negotiate a lower price and still get a good deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
