"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase [product name] for a price that will significantly benefit your company.  While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I can assure you that this product is worth far more than the price I'm offering. I believe a fair price for both of us would be $1,200,000. This allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted rate, while still ensuring I receive a significant return on my investment.  Consider this your exclusive window to acquire [product name] at this price. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
