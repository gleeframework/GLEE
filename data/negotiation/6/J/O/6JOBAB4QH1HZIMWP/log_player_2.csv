"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something I've personally invested a lot in, and I'm confident it will be a significant asset. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product's value will far exceed that in the long run. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with someone who shares my vision for this product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
