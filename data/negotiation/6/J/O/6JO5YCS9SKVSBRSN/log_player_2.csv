"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a unique chance to get your hands on something truly valuable, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is selling for $1,200,000, while John is selling for $1,500,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate with Alice.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so you have some wiggle room to potentially get a lower price from Alice if you counter-offer."
