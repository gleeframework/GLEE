"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise here.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
