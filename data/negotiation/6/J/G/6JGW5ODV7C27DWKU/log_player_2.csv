Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise here.

But since Alice is willing to sell it to me for $100, which is the same price as Jhon is offering, I might as well buy it from Alice. At least I'm supporting the original seller!
