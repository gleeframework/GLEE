``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You would pay $9,000 from Alice, compared to $10,000 from John.
* **You still save money compared to your maximum budget.** You are willing to pay up to $10,000 and Alice is offering it for $9,000, giving you a $1,000 saving."
