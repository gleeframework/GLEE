"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $100 is above your maximum budget of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** Knowing John is willing to sell for $120 gives you a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower than Alice's offer:** $85 is a significant drop from $100, showing you are serious about negotiating.
* **Within your budget:**  $85 is still below your maximum price point of $120.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's potential for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my absolute bottom line. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll be happy with it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While lower than her initial offer, $95 is still above my desired price point and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, making it likely that I can get the price down even further.
* **John's offer is a safeguard:** Having the option to buy from John for $120 allows me to walk away from the negotiation if I feel it's going nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price considering we are both willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** $90 is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating good faith and showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Still within budget:** $90 is comfortably below my maximum price point of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a good chance she might accept this offer or counter with a price closer to my target."
