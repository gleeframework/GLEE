"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer and doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  My offer of $1,280,000 stands, but I need to be upfront - I have another interested buyer. If we can't agree on a price close to that within the next round or two, I'll need to explore that other opportunity.",1280000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, and I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Please consider this revised offer.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
