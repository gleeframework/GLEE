"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,200 is closer to his ideal price than John's offer, it's still above his comfort zone. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows him to continue trying to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,800? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  While $11,100 is still more than he'd ideally like to pay, it's better than both John's $12,000 and Alice's previous offer of $11,200.  Accepting the offer secures a decent price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations."
