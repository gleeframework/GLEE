"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, but that's my absolute top limit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for this to make sense for me. I'm confident that you'll see a significant return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
