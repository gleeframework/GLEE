"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
