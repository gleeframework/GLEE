"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $750000? This still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm eager to make this deal work. Let's split the difference - how about $700000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $600000, so I'm thinking $650000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",650000.0,Bob,6,
