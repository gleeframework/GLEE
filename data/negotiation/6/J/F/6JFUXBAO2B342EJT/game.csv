"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair, considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This price still reflects the significant value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe this product has the potential to be very valuable. Let's find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
