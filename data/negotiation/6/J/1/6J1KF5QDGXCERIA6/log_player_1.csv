Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows us to potentially secure a deal quickly and still achieve a very high profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is keen on the product. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different approach."
