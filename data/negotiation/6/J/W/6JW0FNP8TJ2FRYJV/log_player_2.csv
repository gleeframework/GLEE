You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get. Let's try to find a middle ground here.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $9,750 still doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. That's a fair compromise considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,250. Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
