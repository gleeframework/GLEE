Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some leeway in case Bob wants to counteroffer.
* **It's a fair price:**  It represents a middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.

I chose to be friendly and enthusiastic in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. While it's better than his initial value of $10,000, it's not a good enough price for me. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but represents a significant compromise on my end. I'm hoping this offer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's make it $9,750 and close the deal?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $9,750 still doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. That's a fair compromise considering the value this product offers.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm keeping the offer above my minimum while showing willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards a compromise that might lead to a successful deal."
