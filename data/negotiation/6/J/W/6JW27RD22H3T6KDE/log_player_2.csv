"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it can offer your business.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and likely a better deal for you than selling it to John. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still leaves a considerable profit margin for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't budge on my $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. As I mentioned, I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering John is also offering it to me for that amount.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
