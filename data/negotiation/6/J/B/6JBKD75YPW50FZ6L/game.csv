"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While $8200 is a good start, I need to be closer to $9000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference and try $8750. It's a fair price for a product we both value.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8500 is still a little too low. I'm happy to make one final concession. How about $8650? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",8650.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8400, but that's as high as I can go.",8400.0,Bob,6,
