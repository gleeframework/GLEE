"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9800. Can you consider this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9800. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, so I'd like to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
