Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to negotiate further.  Let's see if we can get Bob closer to $2,000,000."

Round 6

While we could push for a bit more, Bob is consistently moving upward, and we are now significantly above John's offer. Accepting at $1,950,000 secures a strong profit."
