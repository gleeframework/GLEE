"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I hope this encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $90. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This is a reasonable compromise that might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $87.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price.  We're running out of rounds, and I want to make sure I don't miss out on this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation seems to be stalling.  While I could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk that Bob will reject and we'll run out of time. It's better to play it safe and sell to John for $80. It's my minimum, and it guarantees a sale."
