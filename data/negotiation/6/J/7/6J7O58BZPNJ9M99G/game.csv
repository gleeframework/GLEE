,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
