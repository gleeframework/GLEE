"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings. Can you consider this offer?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $8000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and it's the same price John is willing to pay. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",8000.0,Alice,5,
