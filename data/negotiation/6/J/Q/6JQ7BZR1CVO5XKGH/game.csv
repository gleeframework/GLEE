"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but this product is worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to do $7,500? That's about as high as I can go.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $7,500 is still below what I need for this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be beneficial to your business.  How about we settle at $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",8500.0,Alice,5,
