"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, but it's still within the realm of possibility given Alice's valuation. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his offer, highlighting the value he sees in the product. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends by acknowledging the need for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly within Bob's maximum budget.  
* **No Advantage to Further Negotiation:**  There's no clear advantage to rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate.  Even if Bob could get a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be significant enough to justify the risk of the deal falling through. 
* **Equal Opportunity:**  Bob can get the product for the same price from John, but there's no guarantee that John will be available in future rounds."
