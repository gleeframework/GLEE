Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value beyond even your initial assessment.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go as low as $1,150,000.  To move things forward, I'd consider $1,275,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a very fair offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but at $1,225,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's less than my initial ask, it's still a significant profit above my minimum. Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk Bob will lower his offer or that the deal could fall apart. Accepting now secures a good outcome."
