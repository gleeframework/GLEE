"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value beyond even your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what we're discussing.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,350,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go as low as $1,150,000.  To move things forward, I'd consider $1,275,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a very fair offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but at $1,225,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
