Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John at $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $120 goal.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message hints at a ""special price"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though it's above his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
