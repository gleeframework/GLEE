Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **High but Reasonable:**  The offered price is high, but not so high as to be insulting or immediately make Bob think it's out of reach. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
