"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident that this product is worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
