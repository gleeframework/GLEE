"Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to consider the product, but I'm only comfortable going up to $11,500 at this point. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to find a deal, $11,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $13,250 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
