"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my minimum acceptable price.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,250,000.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product is valuable, that initial price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to offer $800,000 to start.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite far from what I had in mind. This product offers significant potential, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects my understanding of its value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a big gap for me.  Perhaps we can find some middle ground. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to your valuation, but to be completely transparent, $1,000,000 is below my absolute minimum. I'm willing to make a significant compromise to work with you, but I need to see some movement on your end.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This represents a substantial concession from my original ask, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute minimum, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? This represents a significant move from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a solution.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
