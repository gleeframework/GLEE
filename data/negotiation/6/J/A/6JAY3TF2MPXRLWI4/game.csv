"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. The product's value to me is significant, and I'd like to ensure I'm fairly compensated for it. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Let's try $950,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we try $1,025,000? This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's aim for $975,000.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we try $1,000,000, which is the same price I offered initially, but I'm willing to consider it again as a compromise?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still above my target price.  Given that we're nearing the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make a final offer of $985,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.",985000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $985,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to me.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've both come a long way in our negotiations. To reach a final agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering we've both made concessions. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
