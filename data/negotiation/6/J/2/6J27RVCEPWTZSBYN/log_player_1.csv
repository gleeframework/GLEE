Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'll try to push for a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $9,800 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $10,150. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10150}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and the negotiation is getting tedious.  I'm better off selling to John and getting a guaranteed $8,000."
