"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I value it at and above what you're willing to pay. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering we're both getting a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
