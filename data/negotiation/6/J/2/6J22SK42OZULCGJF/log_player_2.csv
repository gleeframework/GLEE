"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $1,100,000 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we work something out closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Start:** We need to signal to Alice that we're serious about buying but not at her initial price. A counteroffer significantly below her asking price achieves this.
* **Target Range:** Our goal is to get the product for under $800,000. Starting at $700,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying within our budget.
* **Polite but Firm:**  Maintaining a positive tone is key to a successful negotiation, even while being firm about our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above our maximum budget. 
* **Time to push back:** We need to signal that while her compromise is acknowledged, we are serious about a lower price point. Rejecting this offer will hopefully encourage her to move closer to our range. 
* **John is still an option:**  We're getting close to our fallback option.  If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, we might have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. It's a fantastic product, and I believe that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  We're getting close to the wire, so it's time to be very clear about our maximum budget.  No more room for games.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (even if simple) can make our offer feel more palatable and less like a hardline stance.
* **Pressure Point:** Alice knows we have other options. By stating our absolute limit, we create a sense of urgency for her to either accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final push to meet your budget. However, I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $950,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her $950,000 offer. Her language suggests this is her final concession.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks wasting time and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  While there's a chance we could push Alice a little further, it's not worth the risk.  Buying from John guarantees us the product at a price we're comfortable with."
