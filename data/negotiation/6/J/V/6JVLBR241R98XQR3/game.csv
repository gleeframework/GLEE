"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value to me is significantly higher than that.  I could come down to $900,000.  I believe this price better reflects its true worth and leaves some room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is closer to my budget and still reflects the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
