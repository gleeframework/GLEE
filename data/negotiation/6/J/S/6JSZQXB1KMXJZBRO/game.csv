"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,700,000. It's a significant investment, but one that I believe will yield substantial returns for you.  While I have a backup offer for $1,500,000, I'm confident that this product's worth to you justifies this slightly higher price. Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset before it's gone.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
