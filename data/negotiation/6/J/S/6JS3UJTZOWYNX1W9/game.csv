"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1150000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1225000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not there yet.  $1200000 is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'll meet you at $1200000, but I need to get at least a slight premium for the product. I'll counteroffer at $1220000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
