"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, it's unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we settle at $9,250? This is a fair price that bridges the gap between our expectations. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. Can you consider that?",9100.0,Bob,6,
