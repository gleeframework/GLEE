"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you and the value it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is significantly less than Alice's $1,200,000 offer."
