Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value in this product, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $1200000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at the minimum acceptable price for me, I have 9 more rounds to potentially get a higher price. It's worth exploring if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm prepared to offer $1300000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.
