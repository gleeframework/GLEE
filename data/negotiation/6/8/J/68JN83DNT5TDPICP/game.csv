"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1400000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1450000.  This represents a significant reduction from my initial counteroffer and brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $1450000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's try to finalize the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1550000 is getting closer to my budget, but I can only offer $1500000 at this time. I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price and avoid further negotiations.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
