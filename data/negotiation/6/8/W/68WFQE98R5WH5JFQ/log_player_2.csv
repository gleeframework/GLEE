"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price or buy it from John for $120. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our maximum budget and John's offer.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  We frame the counteroffer politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone. Mentioning that $115 is ""a bit steep"" suggests we're open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than our initial budget and John's offer. 
* **Limited Time/Options:**  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now secures a good price."
