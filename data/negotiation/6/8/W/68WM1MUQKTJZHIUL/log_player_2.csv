"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you at a special price of $110. It's a steal for a product that's worth much more! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product from John for $100, which is less than Alice's offer of $110. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
