"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but it needs to be much lower. How about $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This leaves room to bargain upwards.
* **Significant Difference:** The $8,000 offer is substantially lower than Alice's starting price. This signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. Her response will give me a better sense of how much lower she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer is still $1,000 over your maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance she might come down further.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup option with John at $10,000, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to move up, but not by a large amount. It keeps the negotiation going without conceding too much.
* **Closer to Target:**  $9,500 is getting closer to your $10,000 limit, representing a good balance between saving money and potentially securing the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit higher than your last offer, but not much. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Over Budget:**  $10,500 is still $500 over your maximum budget.
* **John's Offer is Better:** At this point, John's offer of $10,000 is more appealing.
* **Final Counter Offer:** You can use the next round to give Alice a final offer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $10,500 is more than I'm willing to spend. I can do $10,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is your maximum budget and should be presented as a firm limit.
* **Transparency:** By being upfront about your budget, you signal to Alice that you're serious and this is not a tactic to get a lower price. 
* **Alternative:**  You've made it clear you have John's offer as a backup, which adds weight to your position without explicitly threatening to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,250, and you've stated your firm limit is $10,000. 
* **John's Offer is Available:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at your target price.  There's no point risking further negotiation with Alice when you can get the product for your desired price elsewhere.
* **Time Saved:**  By choosing John's offer, you avoid potentially lengthy and fruitless back-and-forth with Alice."
