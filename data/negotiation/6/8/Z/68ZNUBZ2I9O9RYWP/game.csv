"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in this product but would need to see a lower price to proceed. Would you be willing to negotiate? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10000. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to purchase it from you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000 for the product, plus these extras?",11000.0,Alice,7,
