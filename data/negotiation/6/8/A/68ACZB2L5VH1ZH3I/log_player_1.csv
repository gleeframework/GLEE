"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you an idea of his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $120. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. You started high, and he countered with a reasonable but lower price. You haven't reached a point where selling to John for the same amount is the better option yet.  Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a common negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still above Bob's valuation and haven't dropped to our absolute minimum. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also value the product. 
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds if needed, but aiming for a quicker resolution is generally ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $125 is a good deal. It's above your minimum acceptable price ($120) and provides a $5 profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has incrementally increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in purchasing the product. 
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, accepting now secures the profit. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome, and it risks Bob losing interest."
