{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm confident it's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand $12,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and hopefully we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13500. How about we split the difference and settle at $12750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
