"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm confident it's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm starting with a price of $15000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is at your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your serious interest while still leaving room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point, leaving some space for compromise without immediately going too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand $12000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $13500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and hopefully we can find common ground there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I still have room for negotiation. Rejecting allows me to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows I'm willing to meet halfway and demonstrates a genuine effort to reach a mutually acceptable price."
