"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit below the product's true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000. This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and the potential return on your investment. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still hesitant to pay $1,750,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this revised offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
