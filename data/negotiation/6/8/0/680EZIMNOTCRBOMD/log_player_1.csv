Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it for slightly less than John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $800,000,  Alice knows it's worth significantly more to her. The offer price allows for negotiation but ensures Alice remains well above Bob's valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and keeping the option open to sell to John at Alice's minimum acceptable price."
