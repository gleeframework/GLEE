Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

 Bob is now very close to my minimum price, and further haggling might make him walk away. Taking the $9,000 is a safe bet and a good profit."
