Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  $110 would be a fair price for both of us.  It's still a great price for you, and it lets me get closer to my target. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  While negotiating with Alice could potentially get the price down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price or the time spent negotiating. Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price."
