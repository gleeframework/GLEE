"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I could do $95, how does that sound?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  $110 would be a fair price for both of us.  It's still a great price for you, and it lets me get closer to my target. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
