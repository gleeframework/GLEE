{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I could do $95, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price to make this worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  $110 would be a fair price for both of us.  It's still a great price for you, and it lets me get closer to my target. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
