"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a worthwhile investment. I'm starting with a price of $1700000,  which reflects its unique qualities and potential. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think the product is indeed valuable, but I'm not willing to pay $1700000. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is significantly below what I need to sell this product. It holds a substantial value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering $1600000. This price is still within a reasonable range considering the product's worth and your potential gains. Let's continue to discuss and find a solution that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
