Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and selling to Bob for more than John's offer is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $800,000 and $1,000,000.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob can justify the high price and potentially sway him to accept. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate down slightly. However, I won't go below $900,000 because I always have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
