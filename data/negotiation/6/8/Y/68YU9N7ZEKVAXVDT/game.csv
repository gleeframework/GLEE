"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has immense potential and would be a great addition to your portfolio.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that it's worth $900000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $750000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $800000. I'll offer it to you for $850000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $850000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $850000, which is $825000. I'm willing to go up to that price, but no higher. Can you meet me at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
