"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $102.50? That would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",102.5,Alice,5,
