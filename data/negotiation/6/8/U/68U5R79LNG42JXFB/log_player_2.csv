"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,500 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, especially since she's stated she's excited about the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Even though Alice is making concessions, she's still not willing to go low enough for Bob to save any money.  Since he's already spent four rounds negotiating, it's not worth continuing. He can get the product for a lower price, and it's more beneficial to avoid further negotiation at this point."
