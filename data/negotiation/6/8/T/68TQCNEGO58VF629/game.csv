"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm starting with an asking price of $1500000. This reflects the potential it holds, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $800000. This is the maximum I can pay, considering the value I place on this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
