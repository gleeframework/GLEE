"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm starting with an asking price of $1500000. This reflects the potential it holds, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
