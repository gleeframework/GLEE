"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your personal value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** There's room to negotiate since Alice's value is $80 and your value is $150.  You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint offer:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Alice's minimum value ($80) and my maximum value ($120). This is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for Alice to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to her without going below her minimum value. This keeps the negotiation open and encourages Alice to accept a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to my maximum value, it's still above my personal value of $150.
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better price by continuing.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still a gap between Alice's offer and my maximum value. I can make a counteroffer that's more appealing to her while staying within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. This shows good faith and signals my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** By offering $110, I'm strategically positioning myself in the middle ground between Alice's last offer ($130) and my previous offer ($100). This increases the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Keeping Alice Engaged:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, encouraging Alice to consider a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my maximum value:** Alice's offer is just above my personal value of $150, but it's the closest she's come to my desired price range. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will become frustrated and walk away from the deal.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Further negotiation will take time and effort, and there's no guarantee that a lower price will be achieved.  It's better to secure this offer and avoid the potential for a deal to fall through."
