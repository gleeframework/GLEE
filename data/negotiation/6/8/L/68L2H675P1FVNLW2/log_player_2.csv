"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $95 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $92.5 is still too high.  There's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows for another attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  Offering $87.5 is a reasonable middle ground between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's latest offer of $92.5. This shows you're serious about getting a deal, while still leaving some room for Alice to come down a bit further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within your budget.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a significant improvement over her initial offer.  Accepting the offer now prevents further rounds of negotiation, which could lead to further delays or a situation where Alice becomes unwilling to negotiate further. Buying from John for $100 would be less advantageous at this point."
