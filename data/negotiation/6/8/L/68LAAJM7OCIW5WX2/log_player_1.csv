"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree that the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its market value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1200000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $700,000; I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below what John is offering.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a standing offer at this price."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Limit:** We're now matching John's offer. This makes it clear to Bob that we have a strong alternative and won't go any lower.
* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision.  
* **Transparency (Slightly):** Mentioning the standing offer without revealing John adds credibility to our position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your final offer is getting closer to what I can afford.  However, to make this deal happen, I need you to come down a bit more. I can do $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has not significantly increased his offer despite our clear signal with a ""final offer."" This suggests his price ceiling is firmly below our minimum.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Each round spent on Bob is an opportunity cost.
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a firm offer in hand that meets our minimum price. There's no need to concede further to Bob."
