"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I believe will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet at $1,300,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope this offers a compromise that is acceptable for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
