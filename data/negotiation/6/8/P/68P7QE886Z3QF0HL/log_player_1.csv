Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point that allows for some room for negotiation while still getting a price significantly higher than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering at $110.  This is a compromise that is closer to my original offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is only slightly above John's, it's still worth it to me as I'm getting a higher price than John's offer. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $102."
