Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, but only $8,000 to Bob. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, $10,500 is still more than what he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further."
