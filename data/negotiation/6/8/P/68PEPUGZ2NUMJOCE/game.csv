"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is my final offer.",14500.0,Bob,4,
