Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and it's still below John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will move significantly higher, so it's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
