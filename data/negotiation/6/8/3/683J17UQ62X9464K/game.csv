"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12,250, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $12,500. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $12,500, which is $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
