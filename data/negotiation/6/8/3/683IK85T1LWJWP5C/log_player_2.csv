Alice seems firmly planted around the $1,025,000 mark and isn't budging. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her at this point. While buying from John is a less ideal price, it's better to secure the product at a guaranteed price within our budget than risk Alice not budging and missing out altogether."
