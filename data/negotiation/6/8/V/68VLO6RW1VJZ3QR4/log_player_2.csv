# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000 for the product.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is certainly of interest to me, but $600,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'd be willing to pay $450,000."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $475,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $520,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and the risk of her walking away is increasing. $520,000 is a reasonable price and a significant saving compared to John's offer."
