"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is certainly of interest to me, but $600,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'd be willing to pay $450,000.",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $550,000?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $475,000. Let me know what you think.",475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $475,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  How about we settle at $500,000? It's a fair price that considers both our positions.",500000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $520,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",520000.0,Alice,7,
