"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is still above his budget.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice, or if that fails, he can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still within a reasonable range.  He wants to signal that he's serious about getting a good deal, and he's not afraid to walk away if necessary.  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice isn't willing to accept it immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  He has more rounds to negotiate, and he's shown that he's willing to walk away.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price.  Also, if the negotiation fails, he can still buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now closer to the middle ground. He's willing to increase his offer, demonstrating good faith, but he's still not willing to pay Alice's full asking price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and hopefully gets Alice closer to his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate.  He's shown he's willing to walk away and has a backup option with John.  A few more rounds might get Alice to his target price or at least closer.  If not, he can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now getting very close to Alice's offer, but he's still trying to push for a better price. He's demonstrating that he's willing to pay a fair price but is also persistent in getting the best possible deal. This counteroffer leaves room for a compromise, but if Alice rejects it, Bob will be prepared to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his ideal price, he's only two rounds away from his final chance to negotiate with Alice, and then he'll be forced to buy from John. 

Here's why accepting is the best move at this point:

* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds left, Bob has limited time to get a better deal.
* **Slight Improvement:** Alice's offer is only $10,000 higher than his last counteroffer, indicating she may be getting closer to his price range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If he rejects and Alice counters again, he might end up with a worse offer, potentially even exceeding John's price.

While he might be able to squeeze out another $10,000 or $20,000, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and close the deal before the time runs out."
