Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer. I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $75 is tempting, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```

I'm proposing a middle ground price that's closer to my desired price of $80, but still a bit lower than my original offer. I'm also trying to keep the negotiation amicable by emphasizing that we're both looking for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $78 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $80. Bob is clearly not willing to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether. Accepting his offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
