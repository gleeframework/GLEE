"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the significant potential this product holds for your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to finding a deal, and I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. While I value the product, $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but this is my final offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
