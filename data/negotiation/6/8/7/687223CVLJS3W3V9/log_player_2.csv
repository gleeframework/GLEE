"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm asking for $1000000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
