"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $12250. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would save you the cost of selling to John.  What do you say?",12250.0,Bob,4,
