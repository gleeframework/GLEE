"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($120). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value as possible. Offering $130 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $15 more than her value for the product.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product for $15 less than what he'd pay John. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse deal."
