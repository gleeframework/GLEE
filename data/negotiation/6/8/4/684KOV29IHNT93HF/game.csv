,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm already prepared to buy it elsewhere for $10000. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to sell to someone else. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your last offer, and I'm already prepared to pay $10000 from someone else. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $11000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth negotiation.  If you're still interested, let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
