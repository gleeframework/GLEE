{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I think it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and framing it as a ""great deal."" This makes the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum so I can potentially increase the price with counteroffers.
* **Prepared to walk away:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm already prepared to buy it elsewhere for $10000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, I can likely get a higher price by negotiating further. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for a significantly higher price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to sell to someone else. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to sell it to someone else. This subtly increases the perceived value and my leverage.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on value.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to potentially make a slightly higher counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your last offer, and I'm already prepared to pay $10000 from someone else. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Close to deal-breaking point:**  While the gap is narrowing, it's getting closer to a point where it might be more worthwhile to sell to John for $15,000.  
* **Assessing John's offer:** I need to consider if I'm willing to potentially risk missing out on John's offer for a slightly better price from Bob. It's a gamble.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make one more counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price.  However, I'll be more cautious this time, considering the risk of losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth negotiation.  If you're still interested, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm committed to finding a solution while maximizing my profit.
* **Emphasizing Finality:** I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen"" to emphasize that this is a final offer and I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While $11,000 is still below my ideal, I'm recognizing the risk of losing Bob and missing out on John's offer. 
* **High-Value Product:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value, reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John for $15,000, as the potential loss of value with Bob is not worth risking a deal with John."
