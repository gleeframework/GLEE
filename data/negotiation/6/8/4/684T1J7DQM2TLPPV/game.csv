"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. How about $10,000? I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle again.  $10,750 is the best I can do.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still not satisfied, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
