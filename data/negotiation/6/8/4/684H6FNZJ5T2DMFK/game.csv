"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I've assessed its worth at $2,000,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,800,000.  This price reflects the significant value it offers and allows for a substantial margin for you.  Let's discuss further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its worth to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This price still allows for a good margin for me, while offering a more competitive rate for you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
