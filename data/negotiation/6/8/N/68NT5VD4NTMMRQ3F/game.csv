,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more reasonable offer closer to my valuation. How about we consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be fair, $800,000 was a low starting point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the improved offer.  I appreciate you coming up to your perceived value. However, I have had significant interest in this product from other parties, with offers exceeding yours. I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to see a price that reflects the true market value.  Could you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
