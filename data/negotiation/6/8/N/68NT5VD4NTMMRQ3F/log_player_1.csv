"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), you establish a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** While the price seems high, the message emphasizes the product's ""unique features and potential."" This subtly suggests the value might be higher than Bob initially perceives. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions this is an ""initial offer,"" signaling to Bob that you are open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  This suggests there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and are willing to walk away from a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see a more reasonable offer closer to my valuation. How about we consider $1,500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Reframing:** You start by acknowledging Bob's offer, showing you are engaged in the negotiation. However, you directly state that his offer ""undervalues the product significantly."" This pushes back on his low anchor while avoiding outright negativity. 
* **Strategic Concession:** While still above your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you make a substantial move down from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate but also sets a boundary.
* **Call to Action:** You directly ask Bob to ""consider"" your price, prompting him to re-evaluate and make a counter-proposal. The language suggests a collaborative approach rather than a confrontational one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  To be fair, $800,000 was a low starting point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Information Revealed:** Bob has revealed that he is aware of John's offer ($1,200,000). This is a crucial piece of information. 
* **""Maximum Budget"" Tactic:** Be wary of claims like ""maximum budget."" It's a common negotiation tactic. While Bob may genuinely not want to go higher, there's a chance he has some flexibility.
* **Potential for More:** You are still in a strong position. Bob is at his perceived value, and you have the option of John's offer as a backup. By rejecting, you signal that you know your product's worth and are willing to walk away for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the improved offer.  I appreciate you coming up to your perceived value. However, I have had significant interest in this product from other parties, with offers exceeding yours. I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to see a price that reflects the true market value.  Could you consider $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Validate and Pivot:**  You acknowledge Bob's offer improvement but subtly challenge his ""maximum budget"" claim by mentioning ""other parties with offers exceeding yours.""  This leverages the information Bob revealed about knowing John's offer without explicitly naming John.
* **Strategic Retreat (But Not Too Far):**  You come down from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession but still keeps you above both your minimum and John's offer, allowing room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Focus on Value:**  You shift the conversation back to ""true market value,"" subtly reinforcing the idea that Bob's offer is undervaluing the product based on external interest.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative. You are still inviting Bob to counter and find a solution, but you're firmly holding your ground on price."
