Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I can likely get closer to my target price of $800,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to close the deal and secure $800,000."
