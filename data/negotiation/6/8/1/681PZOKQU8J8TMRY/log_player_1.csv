Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair offer. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) is unlikely to be successful. However, a price like $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on value and potential, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a much higher return than selling directly to John."
