Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price of $1,500,000 with John.  

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Bob rejects the offer, the potential gain of $500,000 is worth the risk. 
* **Negotiation:** By setting a high initial price, I leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested but finds the initial price too high. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
