Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price. This is the price that would be ideal for me. While I know it's more than Bob's estimated value, it's important to start high to see if we can reach a compromise.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate. I'm also confident that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's not good enough for me. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is still fair, considering my product's value to me, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my target than my last counteroffer. I'm confident that I can make up for the difference with other opportunities, and selling to Bob ensures a quick and successful transaction."
