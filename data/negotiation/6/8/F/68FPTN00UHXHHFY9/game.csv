"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than that.  How about $900000? This would still leave you with a significant return on investment, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $850000 still falls a bit short of my expectations. How about $875000? This is a fair compromise, and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  Let me know what you think!",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860000. Can you meet me at this price?",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a little frustrated with this back and forth.  We're very close, but $860000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $865000? This is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal. If not, I'll be forced to move on to other potential buyers. ",865000.0,Alice,7,
