Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to close the deal at this price.
