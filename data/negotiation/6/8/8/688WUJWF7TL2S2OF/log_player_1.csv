"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like it's a good deal for him.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $10,000, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can still negotiate with him to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to take a low price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but providing a counteroffer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $8,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob it's worth more than $6,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit away from that number. How about $7,000?  That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** $7,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price. 
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  I have a secure backup offer of $12,000 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Persistent Negotiation:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, but I'm sticking to my principle of not selling below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm reducing my offer slightly from $8,500 to $8,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Emphasis on Closing:** I'm emphasizing that this could be the final offer, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining John as Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
