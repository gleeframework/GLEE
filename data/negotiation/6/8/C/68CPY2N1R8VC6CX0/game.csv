"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is certainly appealing, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This recognizes its worth while still representing a significant investment on your part.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
