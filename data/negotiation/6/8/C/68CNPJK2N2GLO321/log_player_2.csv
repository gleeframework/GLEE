"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer isn't terrible, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than you have to. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to your backup plan and save $2,000."
