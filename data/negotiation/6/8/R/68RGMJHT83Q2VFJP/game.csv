"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? This price still leaves room for profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
