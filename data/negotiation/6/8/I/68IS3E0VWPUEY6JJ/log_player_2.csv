It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,300,000 is above your target price, and you have plenty of rounds to work with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to recoup at least some of my investment. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you a chance to further reduce the price. You have enough rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you get a fair return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
