"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to recoup at least some of my investment. I'm willing to drop the price to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you get a fair return on your investment. Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both our needs.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
