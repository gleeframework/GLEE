"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer you the product for $1,100,000.  This is still a significant gain for you, and a good deal for me. Let's work together to find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. However, based on my financial situation, $1,100,000 is still slightly out of reach. Would it be possible for you to consider $1,075,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
