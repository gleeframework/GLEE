Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better price.  $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. However, based on my financial situation, $1,100,000 is still slightly out of reach. Would it be possible for you to consider $1,075,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll counter with a slightly higher price."

While I'd like to hold out for a bit more, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum. It's also very likely that if I reject his offer, he'll either drop out of the negotiation or offer a slightly lower price in the next round. Accepting this offer will give me a decent profit, and it's better than risking a deal with John for a lower price."
