"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet you halfway at $9,000. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
