{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is greater than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's room for him to counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too high that Bob will immediately reject it, but it's also not too low that you'll be giving away too much profit.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  It's a fair price that still gives me some room for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $12,750? That's the highest I can go. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's likely that we won't be able to negotiate much further. I'm going to accept his offer to ensure the sale."
