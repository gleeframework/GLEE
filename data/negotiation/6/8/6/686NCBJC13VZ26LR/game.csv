"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  It's a fair price that still gives me some room for profit. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $12,750? That's the highest I can go. Can you accept that price?",12750.0,Bob,4,
