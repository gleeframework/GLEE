Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

Here's why Alice starts with this offer:

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Alice knows Bob values the product at $80, starting above that value might work if Bob perceives the product's value differently or has a strong need for it.
* **Below John's Offer:**  Alice has a backup offer of $100 from John. Starting at $120 leaves space to negotiate down while still aiming for a better deal than John's offer. 

This strategy allows Alice to maximize her potential profit while remaining aware of her alternative option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why Alice should reject Bob's offer:

* **Potential for More:** While $90 is closer to Bob's perceived value, Alice knows he's willing to negotiate. There's a chance to secure a price higher than $90.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Alice has a guaranteed $100 from John. This gives her leverage to push Bob a little further. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals she's looking for a better deal and keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above Alice's minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $105 is a strong position for Alice. It's:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's initial offer ($90)
    *  Above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($100)
    *  Leaves a small window for further negotiation if needed. 

By making this counteroffer, Alice aims to secure a profitable deal while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $100 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why Alice should accept Bob's offer:

* **Matches John's Offer:**  Bob is now offering the same price Alice can get from John. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing for more money from Bob carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting his offer guarantees the same amount Alice has secured elsewhere.

While Alice might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, it's a strategic risk with no guaranteed reward. Accepting his offer is the safe and logical choice in this scenario."
