"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final compromise on the price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very highest I could go.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've been very patient and flexible with you, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
