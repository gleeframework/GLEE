"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this item for $900,000. This price reflects not only the current market value but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I believe this offer presents a mutually beneficial solution for both parties. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum price and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving $100,000 compared to buying from John."
