"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9000. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit, and you could save even more money.  If Alice doesn't budge, you can always resort to buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now. How about $8500?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $8750. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price, and $8,750 is a good compromise. It's still within my budget, and I'm not sure how much lower she's willing to go. I'd rather take this deal than risk her getting upset and walking away, or having to buy from John for $10,000."
