Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? That's a fair offer considering my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $9,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and closer to your target. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting guarantees the sale, while further negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away.  

While selling to John for $12,000 is the ideal scenario, it's uncertain if further negotiation with Bob will get you closer to that amount.
