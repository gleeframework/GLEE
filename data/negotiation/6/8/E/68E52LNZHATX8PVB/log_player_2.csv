"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a low offer ($6,000) to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiation environment but also directly states our position and desired price.

By starting low, we signal to Alice that we are serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $13,000 is still considerably more than your $8,000 limit and a long way from your initial offer. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? That's a fair offer considering my constraints."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up But Within Budget:** We increased our offer to $9,000, showing willingness to negotiate while staying within our budget.
* **Justification:** We're giving Alice a reason for our offer (""tight budget"") to make it more convincing. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** ""Meet me halfway"" suggests finding a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Alice to move closer to our desired price range."
