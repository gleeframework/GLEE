"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate further, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget:**  $11,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, but still not within it. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Alice is willing to compromise, and Bob can likely get a better price if he continues to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is still an option:** If negotiations fail, Bob can always purchase from John for his maximum price of $10,000.

Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, while still having the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired numbers. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,900.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm not willing to go lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's Maximum:**  Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice walking away or increasing her price.
* **Buying from John is the same price:**  John offers the product for $10,000, which is only a slight improvement over Alice's final offer.

It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting it minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ending up paying more."
