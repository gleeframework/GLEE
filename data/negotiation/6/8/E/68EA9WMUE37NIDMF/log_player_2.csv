"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject this initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of your product, $20,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by making a bold move. Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within his budget.  This establishes a negotiation range and invites Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can really make a difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. It's best to continue the negotiation to try and secure a lower price. There are still rounds available to work towards a deal that is more favorable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $14,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while still remaining within my limits. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's price point but still staying within his budget.  This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to negotiate. It's a good move to see if Alice will accept this offer."
