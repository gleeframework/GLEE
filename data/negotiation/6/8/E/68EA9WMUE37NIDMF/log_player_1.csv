"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of your product, $20,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can really make a difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $14,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while still remaining within my limits. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that surpasses John's guaranteed $15,000 offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on potential profit. It's strategically wiser to sell to John at this point."
