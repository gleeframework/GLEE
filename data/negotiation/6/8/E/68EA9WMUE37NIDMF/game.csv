"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of your product, $20,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can really make a difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $14,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of your product while still remaining within my limits. Let's make this happen!",14500.0,Bob,4,
