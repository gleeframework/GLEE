"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you and my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way down to $1,300,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,320,000. It's a bit more than your offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
