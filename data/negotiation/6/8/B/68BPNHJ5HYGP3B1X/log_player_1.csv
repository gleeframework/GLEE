{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but below your minimum threshold of $15,000. This provides room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial deal. It also leaves the option open to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold.  While I want to reach a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum threshold of $15,000.  Considering the potential for further negotiation, it's better to accept Bob's offer than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower price."
