Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $12,000 for this product, as I can sell it to John for that price.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 allows for a compromise. It's a good deal for Bob, as he gets a significant discount compared to John, and it's still a profitable sale for me. 
* **Potential outcome:**  Bob is more likely to accept a price that's closer to his perceived value, increasing my chances of selling to him and earning a higher profit than selling to John."
