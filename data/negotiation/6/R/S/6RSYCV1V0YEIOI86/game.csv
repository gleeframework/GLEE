"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $675,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
