"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $12,000. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss other terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is starting at her highest price. There's no benefit to accepting this offer now.  We should counter-offer with a significantly lower price to see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a strong counter-offer significantly below Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below $12,000. This strategy also helps us understand Alice's flexibility and how much lower she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of our product and the market conditions, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to the original price. How about $9,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved down slightly, but we still have room to negotiate.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically, moving closer to her price but still aiming for a significant discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate while standing firm on getting a good deal.  By suggesting a specific price that's the midpoint between our last offer and her current one, we're demonstrating a desire to compromise while continuing to move the price in our favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about $9,250 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating! She came down to the middle ground between her previous offer and ours. This is good progress, but we can likely get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate. We'll make one more counteroffer before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I think we're close to a deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to a price that represents a good deal for us ($3,000 off the initial asking price). This offer shows Alice that we're serious about buying, but we're still aiming for a final discount. If she rejects this, we'll need to seriously consider if a slightly lower price is worth the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $12,000."
