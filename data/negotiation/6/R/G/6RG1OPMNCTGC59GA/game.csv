"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a steal at $200. It's a fantastic deal, what do you say?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $100 for this product. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $160? That's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here.  While $160 is better, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $110? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. However, $110 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $140.  This is a great price for a product of this quality.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $140 is tempting. However, I have a strict budget, and I can't go higher than $115. This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
