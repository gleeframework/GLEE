"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick off negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is quite high and $1,000,000 is considerably below what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
