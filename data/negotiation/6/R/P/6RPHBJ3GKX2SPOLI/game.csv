"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make another counteroffer.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we meet at $11250? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
