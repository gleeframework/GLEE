"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $125.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You can still try to get a better price. $117.50 is closer to your goal of $100, but you can aim for a little lower, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate."
