Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Bob's value of $150.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $125 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $110 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down a bit, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $115. Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $115 isn't my ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $100.  It's worth closing the deal at this point to secure a good profit."
