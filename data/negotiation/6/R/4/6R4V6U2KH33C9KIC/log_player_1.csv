Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, such as ""significant value,"" can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By mentioning you're open to discussion, you show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process, even if he initially finds the price high.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
