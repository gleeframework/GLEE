"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,1,
