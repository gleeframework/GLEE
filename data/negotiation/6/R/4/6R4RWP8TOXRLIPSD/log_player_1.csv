{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you a lot of room to counter if Bob rejects your offer. 
* **It's a realistic price:** It's not too far off from Bob's potential value, increasing the chance of a deal. 

Remember, I'm using a strategy of starting high and being willing to negotiate. The goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($1,500,000) as possible, but also be prepared to take the deal from John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking for something closer to $1,250,000 to make this work for me. This price still gives you a significant saving compared to buying from someone else.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with a higher price:** I've increased the price from Bob's offer of $1,000,000 to $1,250,000, bringing it closer to my desired price. 
* **Reasoning:** I've provided Bob with a reason for the higher price, highlighting that it still represents a good deal for him.
* **Open to compromise:** I'm ending the message on a positive note, suggesting a willingness to find a middle ground.

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward while pushing Bob closer to my minimum price. I'm still prepared to walk away if he continues to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,175,000 is a good offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to push for a higher price. 

I'm going to counteroffer again, but this time I will be more firm in my stance, as I'm getting closer to the point where I might consider selling to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not quite there for me. Given the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a very fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm Counter-offer:** I've increased the price slightly from Bob's last offer, but not by much, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also firm in my stance. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I've reinforced the value of the product, reminding Bob of the benefits he'll gain.
* **Finality:**  I've added a line about considering other offers if this doesn't work, putting pressure on Bob to close the deal. 

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being flexible enough to reach a deal. I'm not going to make any further concessions without seeing a significant counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,150,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not going to continue to lower my price further. At this point, it's better for me to sell the product to John for my minimum price than to risk losing out on a much higher amount by accepting Bob's offer."
