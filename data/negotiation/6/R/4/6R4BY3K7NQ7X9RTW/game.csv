"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest,  $850,000 is still a little outside my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target price. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to buy. What if we split the difference and call it $800,000 even?",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on my target price. I can offer it to you for $825,000, but I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'll meet you at $815,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",815000.0,Alice,7,
