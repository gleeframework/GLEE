Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on my target price.

Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $800,000.  While we might be able to get a slightly better deal in further rounds, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $815,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing."
