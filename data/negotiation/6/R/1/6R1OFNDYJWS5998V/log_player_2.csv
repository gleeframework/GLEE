"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I believe it would be worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it gives you a significant savings and allows me to earn a good price for the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
