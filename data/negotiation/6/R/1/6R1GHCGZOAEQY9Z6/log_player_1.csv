"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  By starting at $100, I create a clear path for both of us to compromise and reach a deal. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This first offer will give me an indication of Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer at a price closer to my desired range, hopefully finding a middle ground.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $85 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95 to try and make this work.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By reducing my price from $100 to $95, I'm demonstrating flexibility and my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintain a higher price:** While I'm reducing the price, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Reiterate the value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Open for further discussion:**  My message encourages Bob to respond and continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 and I think that's a fair compromise.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's moving closer to my desired price, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I can likely get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $120 from John gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. This feels like a fair price that respects both our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By proposing $92.50, I'm offering a compromise that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Maintaining a higher price:**  This counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I frame the offer as a fair solution that respects both our positions, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, and with John's offer as a backup, I want to close the deal as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $91.  This feels like a fair price and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $91 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation isn't over:** I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, especially considering I have a guaranteed $120 offer from John.
* **Using my leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, I can potentially push Bob further in the next round. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting the offer keeps my options open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $91 is still a little lower than I need to be at this point.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $91.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By offering $91.50, I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer of $92.50 and Bob's offer of $91. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Urgency and finality:** The message implies a sense of finality, suggesting that I'm willing to go as low as $91.50, and any further reduction may be impossible.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  The message continues to frame the offer as fair and beneficial for both parties, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Closing the deal:** With only a few rounds left, this counteroffer aims to secure a deal that is slightly below my desired price but still above my minimum acceptable value."
