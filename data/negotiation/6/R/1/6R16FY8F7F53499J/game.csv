"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with the value you'll get from this product.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and it's a bit higher than your initial offer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to a good agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a good return on my investment, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
