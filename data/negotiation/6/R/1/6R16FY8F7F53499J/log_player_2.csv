"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no immediate reason to accept. It's better to see if Alice will lower her price further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and it's a bit higher than your initial offer. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay right now. He's already made a counteroffer and shown his willingness to negotiate, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further in the next round. There's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to a good agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a good return on my investment, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and Bob is getting the product for a price lower than what John is offering.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he'll be left with only the option of buying from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
