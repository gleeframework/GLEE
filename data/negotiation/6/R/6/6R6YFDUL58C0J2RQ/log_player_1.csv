Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing the chance of a sale. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
