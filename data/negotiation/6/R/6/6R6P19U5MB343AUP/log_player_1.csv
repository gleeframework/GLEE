"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident that the product is worth at least $800,000 to him, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low for me, especially considering the product's value to him. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above what I consider to be the minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
