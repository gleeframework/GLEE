"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,500. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",9250.0,Alice,5,
