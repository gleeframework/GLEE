"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident this product is valuable to both of us, and I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This price allows for a healthy profit for you while staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more flexible than my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. This allows for a healthy profit for you while staying within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,285,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more flexible than my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,285,000.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
