"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $150.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Since Alice values the product at $120, there's a range where both of us can benefit. I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my value for the product.  $140 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $130?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135, considering your value for the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $140 to $135, which is a good compromise.  At this price, I'm saving $15 compared to buying from John, and it's still within my budget.  It's worth accepting the deal to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
