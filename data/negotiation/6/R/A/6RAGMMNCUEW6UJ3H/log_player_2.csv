Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe it's the best we can do to find common ground. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
