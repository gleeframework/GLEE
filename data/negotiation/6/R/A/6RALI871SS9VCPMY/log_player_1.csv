Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to make an offer of $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While his offer is at my minimum threshold, I want to see if I can get a better price from him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm ready to sell the product for $15,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $15000 is still a bit higher than my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make an offer of $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,500 is a good compromise and significantly higher than what John would pay."
