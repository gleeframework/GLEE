"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the maximum I believe Bob would pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using friendly language to signal openness to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an even better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. While $13,000 is better than $12,000 from John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $14,000.
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  Bob has already lowered his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have 9 rounds left, giving me time to potentially push for a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and increase the likelihood of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This still allows you a good deal, and gives me a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to justify my position.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize that this is a good deal for both of us.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price while still maintaining a positive and collaborative negotiation."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Goal:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially secure a better price from Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a deal closer to my desired $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, encouraging a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""find a compromise"" to subtly suggest a deadline, prompting Bob to make a decision.

This approach aims to strike a balance between persistence and flexibility, encouraging Bob to accept a price closer to my desired goal while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
