Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't want to rely on him unless necessary.  She wants to maximize her profit with Bob if possible.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's reaction, Alice can adjust her strategy in further communication."
