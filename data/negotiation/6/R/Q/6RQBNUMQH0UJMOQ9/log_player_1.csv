"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's something that I believe will be a huge asset to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's chat!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I have 9 more rounds to work with before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but $1,075,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my strategy of slowly moving towards a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,087,500?  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1087500}
