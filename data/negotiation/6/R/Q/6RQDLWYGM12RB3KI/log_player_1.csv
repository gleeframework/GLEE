"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not exorbitantly high. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer. I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm happy to accept $110, as it's a better price than selling to John."
