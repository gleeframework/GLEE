Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 as a final compromise. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this agreement.
