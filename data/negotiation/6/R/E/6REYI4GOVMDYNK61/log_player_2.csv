"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good value for you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $1,075,000, which is still higher than what John is offering ($1,000,000). However, it's much closer to Bob's ideal price range.  Accepting this offer means Bob saves $25,000 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile deal."
