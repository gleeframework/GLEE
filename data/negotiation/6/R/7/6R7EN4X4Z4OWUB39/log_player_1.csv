Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Value:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion.
* **Plan B:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** I can still fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  This counter-offer is still above Bob's initial offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a compromise, making it seem like a more reasonable option for Bob.
* **Fairness:** The message highlights that this price is ""fair"" for both parties, attempting to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving me some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But No Cigar:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still some room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  The offer from John provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't succeed. 

I want to try to secure a price closer to my desired range before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $10,500 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counter-offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  The message again emphasizes ""fairness"" and a ""win-win"" scenario, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving a small buffer for potential concessions.
* **Finality:** This offer is positioned as a final offer to push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget limit, and I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as high as I can go. If we can agree on that price, I'll make the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price range and significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I might not get a better offer from him. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $15,000 is higher, there's no guarantee that he will be willing to negotiate further. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to secure a sale at a price that is close to my target and above my minimum."
