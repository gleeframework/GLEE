"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. How about we settle at $9,000? That would work well for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $9,000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I need to make it worth my while. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
