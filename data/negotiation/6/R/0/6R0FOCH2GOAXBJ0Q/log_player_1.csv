Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it holds for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my backup offer from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a high price, starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still keeping me well above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning the product's value to Bob, I'm reinforcing why this is a good deal for him, even if it's a high price.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing my profit while still offering a price he might find acceptable."
