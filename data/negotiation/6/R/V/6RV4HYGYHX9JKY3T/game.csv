"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about its value. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for this valuable asset.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but given my financial situation, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our needs.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
