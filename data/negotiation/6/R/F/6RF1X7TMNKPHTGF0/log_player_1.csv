Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,""  Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived $15,000.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly, she's subtly letting Bob know there are other potential buyers. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $15,000,  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Aiming higher initially is a strategic move in a negotiation."
