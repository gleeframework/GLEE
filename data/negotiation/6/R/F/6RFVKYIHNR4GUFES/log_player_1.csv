Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $100, which is good.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're asking for less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150). This gives him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you have room to lower the price a bit to secure a deal without losing too much. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, we can likely do better by counter-offering.  Let's try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is tempting, I need to be closer to $120 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  You're not just sticking to your initial price. 
* **Is still below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so $115 is still a good deal for him.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:**  It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer."
