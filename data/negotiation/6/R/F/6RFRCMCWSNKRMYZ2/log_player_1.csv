Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create a Sense of Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher to give herself more bargaining room.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell the product quickly, she might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob to avoid the risk of going with John."
