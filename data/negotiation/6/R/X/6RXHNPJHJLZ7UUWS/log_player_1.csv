"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and it's more than my minimum asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us and ensure we both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more.  Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my target of $10,000.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to accept just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach a mutually agreeable agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is consistent, it's still lower than my desired price point. I'm not in a rush to sell, and there are still a few rounds left. I believe I can still get closer to my target of $9,000.  There's always a chance Bob will give in with more negotiation, and I want to exhaust those options before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.  How about we compromise and settle on $8,800?  This price is a fair midpoint between our current offers and reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,600? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiation seems to be stuck.  Bob is unwilling to budge significantly from his current offer, and I've already made several counteroffers. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to accept a price below my desired range. 

To maximize my earnings, I'll sell to John for $8,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's guaranteed. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my next offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely."
