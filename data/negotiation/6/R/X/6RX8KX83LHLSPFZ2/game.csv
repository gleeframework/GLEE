"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,250,000?  That gives us both some room to maneuver and allows for a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. This still leaves a bit of room for negotiation while getting closer to your original asking price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
