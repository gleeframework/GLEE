Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be a great value for you, let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While you could start at $149, a slightly lower price like $125 makes the offer seem more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps you understand how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, you might have been able to get a bit more. If he rejects, you can always go lower or move on to John.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Phrasing the offer as a ""special price"" and highlighting ""great value"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even if the price is above his perceived value."
