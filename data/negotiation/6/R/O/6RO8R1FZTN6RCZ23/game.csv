"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I am still not comfortable with $11,000. How about $10,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a valuable product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I see your point, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, $10,500 is a reasonable compromise. I am willing to pay $10,250 for the product.",10250.0,Bob,6,
