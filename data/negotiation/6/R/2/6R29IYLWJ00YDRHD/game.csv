,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110?  It's still a great price for such a valuable product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
