"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,750? That's the highest I can go.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try one more time. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
