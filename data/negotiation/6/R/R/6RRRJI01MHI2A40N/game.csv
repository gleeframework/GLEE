"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in continuing the conversation if you're open to a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what's being offered. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential this product holds for your business.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more reasonable price point. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant.  To move this forward, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to invest in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your maximum valuation, and I respect that. However, accepting $1,000,000 would be selling this product significantly short of its true worth. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a structured deal: $1,200,000 upfront, plus a performance-based bonus of $300,000 if the product helps you achieve [specific, measurable target relevant to Bob's business] within the first year. This way, we both share in the product's success.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
