Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe I can get closer to that by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents a good compromise that allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal on a valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold, $9,000 is still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a competitive price on this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold, $9,500 is still below my desired profit margin. I've been negotiating for a few rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a profit and saves me the time and effort of further negotiations."
