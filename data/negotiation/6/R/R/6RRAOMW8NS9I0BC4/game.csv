"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This represents a good compromise that allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal on a valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a competitive price on this valuable product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
