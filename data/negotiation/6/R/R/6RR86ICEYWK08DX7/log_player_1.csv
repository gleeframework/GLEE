Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $1,950,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger stretch than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,350,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll hold firm on getting a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,700,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I could potentially do $1,500,000. That's the absolute top of my budget, but I think it's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. While I could try to push for more, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away and potentially losing a sale altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and a quick close."
