"Alice, that starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its true market value. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is far below its true value, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This takes into account your budget and my minimum expectations. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer that acknowledges the value of your product while working within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply not enough to justify the value I'm offering.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
