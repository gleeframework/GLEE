"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him can make him more inclined to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its true market value. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.**  It's significantly below the product's worth to me, and even below the market value he mentions. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's starting point is unfavorable, it's clear he's interested in the product. This means there's room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is an option, but not yet ideal.**  While selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, I can potentially earn more through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is far below its true value, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This takes into account your budget and my minimum expectations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving from my initial price but staying above the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a middle ground price is a common negotiation tactic and can be perceived as fair.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to him, subtly pushing him towards a higher price. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to engage in further discussion and potentially accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price point.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer that acknowledges the value of your product while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he has shown a willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer and explore a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net.**  If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can always sell to John and guarantee my minimum price. However, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply not enough to justify the value I'm offering.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:** This tactic further emphasizes my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price higher than Bob's previous offer.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Highlighting the ""fair"" aspect of the price can make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** Reminding Bob of the value he will receive reinforces the rationale behind the higher price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Encouraging Bob to engage in further discussion keeps the negotiation process moving."
