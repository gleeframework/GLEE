Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed offer from John, our goal is to maximize profit. Bob's valuation of $800,000 provides a starting point.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price. Bob may counter-offer, allowing us to potentially secure a deal above $1,500,000. 
* **Balancing Risk:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer.  By starting at $1,300,000, we are balancing the potential for a higher profit with the certainty of John's $1,500,000 offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong fallback option with John."
