Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Offering the lowest price within his budget ($1,200,000) immediately sets a strong baseline for the negotiation. While this offer is likely to be rejected, it establishes Bob's willingness to walk away if a better price isn't negotiated."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob more leverage to push for a price closer to his desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  However, he's still significantly below Alice's offer and within his budget. This approach aims to find a middle ground while staying within Bob's financial limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Even though Alice is getting closer, Bob is still better off rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation. There are still rounds left to potentially negotiate a better price closer to his desired amount."
