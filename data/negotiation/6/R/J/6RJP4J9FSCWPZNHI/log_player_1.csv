Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $200. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive.  
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation. Even if Bob counteroffers lower, the starting point of $200 might make him more amenable to a price higher than $80.

**Important Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Counteroffers:**  Pay close attention to how much Bob counteroffers. This will give you insight into how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
* **The $150 Safety Net:** Remember, you always have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. Don't let the negotiation with Bob drag on if it seems unlikely he'll meet a price that's significantly better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both your minimum acceptable price ($150) and his own perceived value of the product ($80).  It's clear there's a significant gap to bridge.  Rejecting this low offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** By not immediately jumping at a low price, you signal that the product is worth more.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:**  Your rejection will hopefully encourage Bob to increase his offer substantially in the next round. 

**Next Steps (For the next round):**

Your counteroffer should be significantly lower than your initial offer but still comfortably above your minimum.  Aim for a price that leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand $200 is a stretch, but $60 is significantly below its value. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate by dropping the price by $70.
* **Above Minimum, but Room to Negotiate:**  $130 keeps you comfortably above your $150 minimum but leaves space for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Encourages a Serious Response:** By offering a more reasonable price, you encourage Bob to respond with a counteroffer that's closer to your acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we try $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob explicitly stated that $80 is his highest offer.  
* **Below Your Minimum:** $80 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $150.

Continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable. It's time to take the guaranteed sale to John."
