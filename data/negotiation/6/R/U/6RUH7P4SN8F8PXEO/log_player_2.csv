Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 is significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, but $1250000 still isn't quite there for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1475000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and allows us both to walk away happy.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still not meeting my minimum requirement. I'm willing to come down to $1425000, a price that is fair for both of us. I'm confident this deal can be finalized with just a small compromise on both sides.

Alice is still being stubborn and unwilling to budge significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  Even though it's more than I'd like, I've wasted enough time negotiating."
