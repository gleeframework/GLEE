Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your asking price is far too high.  While I see the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it is a fair price given the current market.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
