"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your asking price is far too high.  While I see the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it is a fair price given the current market.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000? This reflects the value it will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market and my current financial situation.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  How about we meet closer to the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
