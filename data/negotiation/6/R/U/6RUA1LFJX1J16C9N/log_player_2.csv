"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,700. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the difference wouldn't be substantial enough to justify passing on John's $10,000 offer."
