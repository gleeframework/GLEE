Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob's valuation is lower than hers but also knows she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. This allows her to start with a strong offer closer to her desired price.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" Alice aims to subtly steer Bob's focus towards the higher end of the product's worth.

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit. If Bob accepts, she gets a great deal. If Bob rejects it, she can still sell it to John for her minimum acceptable price."
