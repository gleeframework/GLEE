"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to me. Considering its value and quality, I believe we can come to an agreement. Let's start with my offer at $130. I hope this price aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, getting closer to our $120 target.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a budget. Could you do $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message remains polite and shows our interest in the product while clearly stating our budget constraints. 
* **Aiming for Target:**  While our target is $120, starting lower gives us a buffer to potentially negotiate a price even closer to our ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. Considering the value it holds, I'd like to propose a price of $120 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer, but still reflects its true worth. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price of $120! There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as we won't get a better deal. Accepting now secures the product at our desired price."
