"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $18,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is definitely out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $15,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $12,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to go a little higher. However, $13,000 is still too much for me. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on it and your need to make a profit. I believe we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
