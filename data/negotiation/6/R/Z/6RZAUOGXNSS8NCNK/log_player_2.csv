"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation significantly lower. It's a starting point, and we can expect Alice to likely counter. This strategy aims to achieve a price closer to John's $8,000 while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $6,500 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming to get as close to $8,000 as possible, so it's worth making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to move but stays firm on seeking a price closer to John's offer. We're getting into the territory where Alice might accept, knowing she risks losing the sale if she rejects and we go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has matched John's price! There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal. This outcome achieves the goal of getting the product at the best possible price."
