"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $6,500 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
