Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher elsewhere (""before I list it publicly""). 
* **Gauge Interest:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially reveal his price sensitivity.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for you to potentially meet in the middle, still exceeding your $12,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You can gracefully move on to John, knowing you secured your minimum selling price."
