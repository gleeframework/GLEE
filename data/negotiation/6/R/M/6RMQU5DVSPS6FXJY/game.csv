"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $135 for it. This price reflects the product's worth while also allowing me to maintain a fair profit margin. I understand that it's valued at $120 by you, but I hope you'll consider the additional benefits and enhancements we've included that justify this price point. Looking forward to your consideration.",135.0,Alice,1,
