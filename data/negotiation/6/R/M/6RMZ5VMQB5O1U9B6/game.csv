"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
