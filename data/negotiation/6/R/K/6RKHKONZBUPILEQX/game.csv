"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still gives you a good deal, and it gets us closer to finding common ground. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. $9,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm willing to go a little further. How about $10,000? That's a compromise on both our sides, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but no further. That's my final offer.",9800.0,Bob,6,
