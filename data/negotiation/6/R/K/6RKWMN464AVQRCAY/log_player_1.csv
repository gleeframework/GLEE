Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Room for negotiation:** The high price leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit beyond your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high asking price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's reaction and potential counteroffers. You can always adjust your price downwards, closer to your minimum acceptable price, during the negotiation process."
