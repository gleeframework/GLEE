Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning for the price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a ""great deal"". 
* **Keeping the option open:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, but I'm also ready to move on to John if needed. 

This approach aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10500. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I could get from John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Avoiding risk:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest price, but I'm willing to risk a lower price to see if I can get closer to my desired value.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Continuing to emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and suggesting it's a fair price.
* **Staying firm:** I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own needs. 

This counteroffer is designed to show flexibility while still maintaining a position that's closer to my desired price."
