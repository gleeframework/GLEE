{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering your needs.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a profitable sale.
* **Message:** The message highlights the value of the product while offering a discount, making the offer more appealing. It also invites Bob to respond and encourages further negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Keep Bob engaged:** The discount and the invitation to respond keep Bob involved in the negotiation and potentially willing to make a counteroffer. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By having John as a backup buyer, I have the option to walk away from the deal with Bob if his counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

* I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round because I have leverage with John's offer. I'm not desperate for a sale and can continue to negotiate with Bob. 

* In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.  I will aim to close the gap between our positions without conceding too much."

Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
