"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident you'll find this price to be very competitive. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is a compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
