"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000? That would still allow me a decent profit, and hopefully, it works for your budget as well.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
