Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to consider my offer.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially make another counteroffer, keeping my minimum price in mind.  However, if I feel the negotiation isn't going anywhere, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's willingness to counteroffer shows interest, and I can potentially close the gap with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:**  Selling to John at this point would guarantee $12,000, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly closer to his $9,500 offer but still above my minimum. I'll aim for a price point that feels reasonable to both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9,500 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $9,750?  I think this price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and meet him halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to keep the conversation amicable and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer if he makes one, or to potentially adjust my price further. However, I'll keep my minimum of $12,000 in mind and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $3,000 below my minimum, it's getting very close to that line.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that further negotiation could result in a price even lower than my minimum, which I'm not willing to accept.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money on this deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing to prioritize the guaranteed profit and sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to get closer to my desired price, the potential for a lower final price from Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher profit from continuing the negotiation."
