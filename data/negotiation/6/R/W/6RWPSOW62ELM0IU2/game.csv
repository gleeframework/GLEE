"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,500 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. Could you meet me halfway at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $9,000 is still above my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is really pushing the lower limit for me.  How about we split the difference again and say $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
