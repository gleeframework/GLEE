"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I see value in reaching a deal quickly, $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the true value of this product. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to compromise further and counter with $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions you've made so far.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I can see you're serious about this purchase. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to compromise further and counter with $1,075,000 again.
