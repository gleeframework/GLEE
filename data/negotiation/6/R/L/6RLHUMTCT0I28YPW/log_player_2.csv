"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you perceive its value to be. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's perceived value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to pay, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.
