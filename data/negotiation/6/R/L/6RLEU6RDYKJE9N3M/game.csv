"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I understand you're looking to get closer to $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
