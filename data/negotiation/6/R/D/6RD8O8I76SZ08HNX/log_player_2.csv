"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant discount from the value it holds to me, and it gives you the chance to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial to you.  Consider this a strategic investment with potential for high returns. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties ready to purchase if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
