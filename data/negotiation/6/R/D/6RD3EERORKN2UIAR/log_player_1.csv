{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, providing a safety net.

By offering the product at $1,400,000:

* You secure a significant profit above your minimum.
* Bob gets a good deal, saving $100,000 from his perceived value.
* You avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and having to sell to John for a lower price."
