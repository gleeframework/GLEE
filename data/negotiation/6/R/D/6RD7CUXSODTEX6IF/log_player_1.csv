Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear and positions the product as valuable.
* **Strong Price Point:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still giving Bob a compelling reason to buy. It's a win-win scenario.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could explore other options like starting higher and allowing for some negotiation."
