Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""its value,"" we subtly imply the product is worth a significant amount, potentially more than Bob anticipates.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and implies there might be other interested buyers.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** We end with ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to respond and potentially negotiate, rather than just giving a flat refusal.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still providing a price Bob might consider, given he saves $3,000 compared to your guaranteed sale price."
