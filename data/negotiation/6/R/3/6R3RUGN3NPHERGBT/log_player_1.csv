Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. By mentioning ""significant value,"" it subtly implies the price is justified without explicitly stating why Bob should pay more than its worth to him. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest level.  If he flat-out rejects it, you can always come down significantly. If he counters, you know he's serious and can negotiate from there. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's response."
