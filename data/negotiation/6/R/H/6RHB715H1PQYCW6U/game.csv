"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800000.",750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $750000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700000. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's within your desired range. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $725000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about $710000? This would represent a significant saving for me while still providing you with a good return on your investment.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a lower price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $720000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",720000.0,Alice,5,
