"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $17,500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
