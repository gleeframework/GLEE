Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
