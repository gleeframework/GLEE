"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to be interested.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,500, which is $13,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $13,250 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,800, but that's my absolute limit.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,800 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is just $200 above your limit. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to stick to my budget.  I'm standing by my last offer of $12,800. If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're standing by your last offer, but I'm not willing to accept $12,800. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $13,200, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13200.0,Alice,9,
