"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  This would still give you a significant advantage compared to other options, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,050,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to get a price closer to what I need.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
