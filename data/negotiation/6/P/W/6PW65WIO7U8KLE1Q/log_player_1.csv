"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to what I want.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to get the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price.  I have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a decent increase from his last offer, it's still not enough to make it worth selling to him over John. I'll try to get a better price with another counteroffer. I still have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to stick with a strategy of small incremental increases.  $1,350,000 is closer to his last offer, but still leaves room for him to counter, and for me to accept if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's moving in the right direction, but I'm not going to settle for just a little bit more than John's offer.  I have a few more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,320,000. This is a bit lower than my last offer, but still higher than Bob's.  I want to show him I'm willing to compromise, but I also want to maintain some leverage.  We're down to the final rounds, so I need to be careful about the price I set."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great offer! It's finally above the price John would pay and only two rounds remain.  There's a good chance I won't get a better price, so I'm going to accept and secure the deal with Bob."
