Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $100, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $80.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a good deal for you.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's value to Bob to increase his willingness to pay a higher price.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $90. However, you have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's limited risk in starting with a higher offer."
