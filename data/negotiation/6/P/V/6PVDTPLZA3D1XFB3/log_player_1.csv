Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer further. I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
