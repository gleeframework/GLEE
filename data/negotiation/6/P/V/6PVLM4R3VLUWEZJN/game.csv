"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller.",130.0,Bob,4,
