{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also shows that I'm serious about getting a good price. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel like I'm interested in making a deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price of $150. I'm also trying to make it clear that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150.  While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him instead."
