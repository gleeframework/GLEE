,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I understand you're trying to get the best price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $10,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I really need this product. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. That's the best I can do. Please let me know if it's acceptable.",9250.0,Bob,6,
