I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise and potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and reach an agreement. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $130 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement with Bob.  I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to go much higher than $125. While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $150, it's still a better deal than selling to Bob for $125.  It's time to move on and secure the higher price from John."
