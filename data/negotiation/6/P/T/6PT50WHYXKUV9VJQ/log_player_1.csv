Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he counters, I'm likely to land a price higher than $1,000,000.
* **Balance Confidence and Fairness:** The message aims to convey the product's value while acknowledging that the price is open for discussion.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
