"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
