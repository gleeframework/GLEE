Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to get closer to Bob's value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal without further negotiation."
