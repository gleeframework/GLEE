"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's also a reasonable price, considering Alice's valuation of $800,000. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, but still allows Bob to save a substantial amount of money compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and is only $50,000 higher than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good price for Bob considering his valuation of the product and the risk of losing the product to John. It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price, so it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer."
