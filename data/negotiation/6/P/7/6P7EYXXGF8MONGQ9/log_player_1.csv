Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $130 offer allows for some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also signals that I'm serious about selling the product.
* **John as Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me confidence to push for a higher price. I'll only accept a counteroffer if it's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer. This means there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I will counter with a price closer to my desired value, but still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? That's still a significant discount from my original price and would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I emphasize a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintain Incentive:**  $100 is still a good profit for me, while giving Bob a better deal than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $90? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has shown flexibility and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, potentially closer to $100.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I know I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle.  How about $95? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows a genuine attempt to find a compromise.
* **Small Increment:**  I'm only increasing the price by $5, which signals that I'm not overly rigid and am willing to be flexible.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Overall, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value while still being within a range that Bob might be willing to accept.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $92? This would allow us to find a balance between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $92 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $95.  
* **Potential for Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer means another round of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that he'll budge further. There's also a chance he might walk away entirely.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  While I'd prefer $95, John's offer of $150 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down.  

**Overall:**  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price, and accepting $92 is a good way to secure a sale and minimize potential losses."
