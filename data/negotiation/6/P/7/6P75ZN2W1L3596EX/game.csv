"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While the product seems interesting, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer quickly at that price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 might be a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
