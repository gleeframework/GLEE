"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. "", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also trying to build a rapport by being friendly and confident.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $120? That way, we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm offering Bob the product for $120, which is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept.  I'm also trying to be reasonable and emphasize that this price benefits both of us."
