Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your $8,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go higher if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **It's a fair price for Bob:**  Bob gets a discount on the product's value to him. 

By starting with this offer, you create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it doesn't leave much room for negotiation. It's better to try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal and is closer to what the product is worth. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's tempting to try and push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,250 is a good compromise. It's a decent amount above your minimum of $8,000, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
