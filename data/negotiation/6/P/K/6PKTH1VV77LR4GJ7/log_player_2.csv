"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Reason:Alice's offer is too high. The product is only worth $10,000 to you, and she's offering it for $9,500. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal and is closer to what the product is worth. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate a bit further.  We're aiming to save as much as possible, and $8,500 is still a significant amount above her value."
