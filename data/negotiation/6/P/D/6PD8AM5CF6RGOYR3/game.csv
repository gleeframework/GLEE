"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for this product.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $7,000? That's about as high as I can go.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you at $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
