I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget. This should give us room to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, there's still room to negotiate further. I will make another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $850,000,  which is closer to my maximum budget of $800,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also leaves some room for a final compromise."
