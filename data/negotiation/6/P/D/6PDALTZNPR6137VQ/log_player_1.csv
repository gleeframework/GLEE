Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) leaves potential profit on the table. Offering it at $1,200,000 or higher will likely result in Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point for negotiation. It gives Bob a significant discount compared to your guaranteed sale price while still netting you a substantial profit."
