"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'd like to pay. There's room for negotiation to get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation before reaching my maximum budget or considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product and I think it's worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down a bit, I think there's still room to negotiate. I'm not willing to go up to $130 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to end the negotiation quickly. It's the price I perceive as fair, and while it leaves no room for me to haggle further, it prevents prolonged back and forth.  Alice might accept it, knowing I have John's offer as a backup."
