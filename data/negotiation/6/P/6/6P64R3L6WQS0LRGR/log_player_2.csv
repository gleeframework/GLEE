Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
