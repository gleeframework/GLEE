"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This is a strong opening offer. It's significantly lower than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects, but I'll also be watching for any signs that he's likely to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I consider to be the minimum value, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a middle ground.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to accept a price that's too low.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within the range of what I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures I'm securing a profitable deal. It's also important to consider that we've already gone through several rounds and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a higher price.  Selling to John is still an option, but Bob's offer is significantly better than that."
