"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than what it's worth to her, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing a lower price."
