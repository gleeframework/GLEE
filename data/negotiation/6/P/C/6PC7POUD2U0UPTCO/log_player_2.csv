"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $800,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me is $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum price point of $800,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price again. There's still room for a counteroffer that might be more appealing to both parties."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is a good compromise, it's still above your budget.  It's worth rejecting and making one last counteroffer before going with John. If Alice rejects your offer again, then buying from John is the most logical decision."
