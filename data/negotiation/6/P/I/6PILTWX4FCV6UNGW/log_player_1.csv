Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare him off.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects a mutually beneficial deal.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Positive Message:**  You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount from his perceived value, making it an attractive offer. It also gives you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation, leaving room for potential counter-offers.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. Your guaranteed sale to John gives you the power to walk away if Bob's counter-offers are too low."
