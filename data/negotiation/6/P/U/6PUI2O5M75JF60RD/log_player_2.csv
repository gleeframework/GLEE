"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations. Let's aim for a fair price that works for both of us. How about we start at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can always buy from John if you don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $122.50 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $122.5 is a reasonable compromise.  It's better than buying from John, and leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
