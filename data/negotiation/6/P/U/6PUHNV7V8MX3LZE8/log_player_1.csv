Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you make a good profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes a ""great deal,"" subtly suggesting the price is slightly negotiable while highlighting value for Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know if Bob is aware of John's offer. If Bob knows you have another buyer at $120, your negotiating position weakens."
