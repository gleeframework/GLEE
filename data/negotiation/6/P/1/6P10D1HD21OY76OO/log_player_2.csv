Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
