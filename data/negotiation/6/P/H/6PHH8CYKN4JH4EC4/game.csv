"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me. How about $11,750? This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a way to make this work.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,750 is close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
