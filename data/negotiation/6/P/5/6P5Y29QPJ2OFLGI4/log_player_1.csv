Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $110 is a good starting point to potentially get a price closer to your minimum.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, but offering $110 leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is brief and states the price upfront. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. You can likely secure a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not comfortable going up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to your minimum price, it's still not enough. You have a guaranteed sale with John for $120, and you have some wiggle room to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $105. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer of $95. I think it's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems to be firm on his price, and while $95 is better than nothing, it's still a significant loss compared to selling to John. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $120 sale with John."
