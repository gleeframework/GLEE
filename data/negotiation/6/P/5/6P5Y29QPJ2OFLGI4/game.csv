,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not comfortable going up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $105. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sticking to my previous offer of $95. I think it's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,6,
