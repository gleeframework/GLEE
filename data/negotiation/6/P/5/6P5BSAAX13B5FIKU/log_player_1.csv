"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as much as possible. I'm confident Bob will counter since it's within his budget and I have John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a good amount, I'm aiming for higher. I have John as a backup, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can reach an agreement without risking losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's a small increase, but I'm still aiming for higher.  I have John as a backup, so I can afford to be a bit more patient. I'll counter again, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob is still holding out for a lower price.  While $985,000 is a good amount, it's not as high as I'd like. To ensure I secure at least $1,000,000, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's a safe and guaranteed deal, and I don't want to risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with a lower offer."
