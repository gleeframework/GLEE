"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

Since you're comfortable spending up to $150, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You can secure the product immediately without risking a counteroffer that might lead to a higher price."
