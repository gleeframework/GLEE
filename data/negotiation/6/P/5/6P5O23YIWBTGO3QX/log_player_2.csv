"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $80 from John.  Alice's offer is lower than John's price, so it's worth negotiating further to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer was $65, which is less than John's price of $80.  Offering $55 is a significant discount from her initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate but also leaving some room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, and John is still a viable alternative. You have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 58}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $60 from her initial offer of $65. You're still aiming for a lower price, so you're offering $58, which is a reasonable compromise that leaves room for further negotiation.  You're showing your willingness to be flexible while staying close to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer from $60 to $62. While this is closer to what you are willing to pay, it's still a bit too high, and you have more rounds to negotiate.  You can still potentially get a lower price from Alice, especially since you have the option to buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been slowly lowering her price, and her latest offer is $62.  You're now offering $60, which is a compromise and shows your willingness to close the deal.  It's still lower than her offer, but it's getting closer to what you're willing to pay.  You only have a few rounds left, so this is a good opportunity to see if she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has increased again to $64.  You've already tried to negotiate further and only have a few rounds left. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $80. You're unlikely to get a better offer from Alice, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at all if negotiations continue."
