"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  Mentioning that Bob would enjoy the product can make him more interested.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. I'll use the first few rounds to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay, keeping John's offer of $100 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $90 is still below my minimum of $100.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer of $100 in mind as a safety net, but I want to explore a better deal with Bob if possible.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $90 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price but still staying above my minimum.
* **Motivational Language:**  ""Let's see if we can find a middle ground"" suggests a willingness to continue negotiating while reminding Bob that a deal is still possible. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $95 is a good compromise for me, as it's still above my minimum and could lead to a successful sale. 

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Monitoring John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too expensive for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum of $100 and even below his initial offer of $90.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $100 is still a much better deal for me than Bob's current offer. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** While I'm not happy with Bob's current offer, I'm not ready to give up on negotiations just yet. I believe there's still a chance to get a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $100 while still keeping John's offer in mind."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $92, but that's the absolute lowest I can go. It's still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by dropping my price again, but I'm staying above my minimum value.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still worth a good deal and that he'll be happy with it. 
* **Finality:** I'm implying that this is my final offer, putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

* **Gauging Interest:** This counteroffer will help me assess if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me in the middle. 
* **Managing Risk:** I'm moving closer to John's offer, but still holding out for a better price with Bob. 
* **Setting a Deadline:** By stating that this is my final offer, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision, as I may choose to sell to John in the next round if there's no agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $92 is a bit too expensive for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is still interested, his offer of $87 is still below my minimum of $100.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $100 is still a much better deal for me than Bob's current offer. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I need to be strategic about my offers.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $100. I'll also emphasize the limited number of rounds remaining to encourage Bob to compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time here. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and that time is running out. This creates urgency and pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Attractive Price:**  $90 is a compromise for me, but it's still above my minimum value. It also acknowledges Bob's position but also keeps some leverage. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly but firm, emphasizing the value of the deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Deal:** With limited rounds remaining, I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob while still maximizing my profit.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer of $100, but I'm hoping Bob will come around to my final offer.
* **Risk Management:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by lowering my price, but I believe the pressure of the deadline might push Bob to accept."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We have only two rounds left, and there's not enough time to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $100 guarantees me my minimum price and secures a sale.

**Decision:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the remaining time and his unwillingness to meet my minimum price make John the better option.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal elsewhere in the future."
