"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm very close to accepting your offer, but $115 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $112. If that's not acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",112.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $113, but that's as low as I can go. It's getting close to John's offer, and I'd rather sell it to you.",113.0,Alice,7,
