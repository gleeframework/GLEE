"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $140 to start. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is considerably less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. While $125 is a bit more reasonable, I still feel there might be room for negotiation. How about considering $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I can come down a little bit further, but I can't go as low as $110. How about $118?",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I'd like to propose $115 as our final offer. This feels like a fair compromise given the value of the product.",115.0,Bob,6,
