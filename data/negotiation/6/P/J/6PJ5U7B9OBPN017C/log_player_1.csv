"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position but $16,000 is pushing my limit.  I can do $14,000, which is a fair offer considering John is offering a similar deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you continuing this negotiation and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for recognizing the value I place in this. It's clear we both want this deal done. How about we split the difference and close this out at $14,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Above John's Offer:**  You're getting $14,750, which is slightly less than your ideal price but still more than John is offering. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation might only yield a very small increase in price. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and you risk him accepting John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
