"I have a unique opportunity to sell you an exclusive product. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a good price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, Bob. I'm willing to compromise at $17,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
