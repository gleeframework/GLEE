"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to come close to this price. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum goal of $1,500,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price point considering the value of the product and Bob's initial willingness to pay $1,800,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,850,000.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than this yet. This price is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer at $1,750,000 is a good outcome.  It exceeds my minimum goal and is a respectable price considering the negotiation process."
