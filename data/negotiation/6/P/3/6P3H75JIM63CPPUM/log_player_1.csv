Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $15,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting closer. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and I'd rather get $16,500 than $15,000 from John."
