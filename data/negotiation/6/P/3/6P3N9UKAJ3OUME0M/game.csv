,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product. Let's meet at $135. This is my final offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go.",125.0,Bob,6,
