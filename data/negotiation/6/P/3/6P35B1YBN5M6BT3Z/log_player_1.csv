Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me, but still lower than what I could get from John. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves me with a fair profit, and it's a good price for the value you'll get.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's still a decent profit for me, but also shows that I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will find this price more acceptable."
