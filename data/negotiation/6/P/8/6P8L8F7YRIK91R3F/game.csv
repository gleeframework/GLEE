"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budgetary constraints, however, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
