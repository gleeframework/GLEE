"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with an offer significantly higher than my minimum price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I try to ""anchor"" the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects the initial price, it might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are eight rounds left, giving us ample time to negotiate a price that works for both of us.  

I'll aim to bring Bob closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I need to get a bit closer to $140 for this product. It's high quality and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I lower my price by $20, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not drastically.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point. My hope is to subtly shift Bob's perception of what the product is worth to him.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer still provides room for further negotiation if Bob comes back with another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is high quality, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $110 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Limit:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my absolute minimum of $120. 
* **John is Guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120. Holding out hope that Bob will significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds is too risky. 

It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to potentially end up with even less from Bob."
