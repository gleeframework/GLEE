"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $110.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $108 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go to $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not able to go up to $110. My final offer is $109.  Let's close this deal.",109.0,Bob,6,
