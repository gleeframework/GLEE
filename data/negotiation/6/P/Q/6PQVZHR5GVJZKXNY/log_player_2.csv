"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget of $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price. What do you think?

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $12,000, as I'm guaranteed to get the product at a price I'm comfortable with.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting more time and potentially getting stuck with a price I can't afford."
