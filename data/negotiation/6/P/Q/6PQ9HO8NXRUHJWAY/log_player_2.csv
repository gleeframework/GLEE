"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is only slightly better than your alternative option (John's offer). There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $105, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired price. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest while also making it clear we're looking for a lower price.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to Alice's value ($100) than our maximum ($120), but still a significant savings compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns.  Alice might meet us in the middle again, but we risk her walking away or getting stuck closer to $115.  
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a good offer now is often better than chasing after a slightly better deal."
