"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure $100 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $160 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,145.0
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $160, which would be $145. That's the lowest price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,,
