"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,400. It's a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
