"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe it's a great product, but I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that and more in the long run.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I'm looking for a good deal, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
