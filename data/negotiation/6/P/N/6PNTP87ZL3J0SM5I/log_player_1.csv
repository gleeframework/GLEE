Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant. I could come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firmly stuck at $1,050,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my $1,200,000 valuation. Accepting his offer means losing a potential $150,000. Selling to John guarantees I receive the full value of the product to me."
