"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation in your favor. Even though Bob's perceived value is lower, your initial offer sets a reference point that can influence his counteroffers.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value and your willingness to find a fair deal can encourage Bob to engage seriously in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about we aim for $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have ample room for negotiation and time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,450,000?"" , 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** While rejecting Bob's offer, you've made a substantial concession to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, you subtly remind Bob of its worth beyond his initial perception.
* **Midpoint Exploration:**  The new price aims for a point closer to the middle ground, encouraging Bob to engage in a more balanced negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're valuing the product at $1,450,000. While I respect your assessment, I believe we can still reach a fair agreement. How about considering $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating within a more reasonable range, but his offer is still below your minimum acceptable price. You have the leverage to counter and aim for a better deal.  There's no immediate need to accept John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for this product. That's a very competitive price considering its value. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** You're holding onto a price above your minimum, demonstrating that you're serious about your valuation.
* **Small Concession:** A smaller concession this round signals that you're getting closer to your bottom line. 
* **Direct Appeal:** By directly asking ""What do you say?"" you encourage a response from Bob and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This seems to be a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gains are shrinking and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further rounds and secures a profitable outcome. 

While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting $1,300,000 is a solid win in this scenario."
