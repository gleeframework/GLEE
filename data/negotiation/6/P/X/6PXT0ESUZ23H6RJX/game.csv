"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. Could you do $1,300,000? I'm eager to find a fair agreement with you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
