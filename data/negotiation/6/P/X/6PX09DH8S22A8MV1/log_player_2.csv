"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **Your Maximum:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

While you could try to haggle with Alice, accepting $120 gets you the product for $30 less than your maximum and John's price."
