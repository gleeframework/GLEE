"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can potentially save even more by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice will be willing to drop the price further to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I get a good return on my investment.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than what you're willing to pay from John. While there's a chance she might drop the price further, it's not guaranteed. Since you have a guaranteed alternative at $10,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
