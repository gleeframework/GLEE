"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the highest possible price, significantly above both Bob's perceived value and John's offer. This gives us room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob realizes. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows us to see how eager Bob is and how he reacts to a high price. His response will help us strategize for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value but still significantly above what he considers ""fair.""  We have ample room to negotiate and are not pressed for time. Selling to John guarantees our minimum but leaves potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly unique. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects its potential while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price, but not drastically. This signals willingness to negotiate while reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Anchoring:**  By proposing a price of $2,000,000, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range.
* **Justification:** We're framing the concession as ""meeting in the middle,"" even though it's closer to our initial offer. This creates an illusion of fairness. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still significantly above Bob's initial offer and John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Bob is moving slowly, indicating he's still willing to pay a higher price. We're in no rush with John's offer as a safety net.
* **Maintaining Value:** While $1,700,000 is a good profit, dropping too quickly might signal desperation and limit potential gains.
* **Further Negotiation:** We have six rounds left, providing ample time to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I also need to ensure this deal reflects the true worth of the product. Let's aim for a win-win. Would you be open to $1,900,000? This shows my willingness to negotiate while respecting the value you'd gain."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our price by a smaller amount ($100,000) compared to Bob's concession ($100,000), showing him we're getting closer to our limit. 
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:** Emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Value Focus:** Continuously reiterating the product's value reinforces its importance and justifies a higher price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking if he'd be ""open to"" this price encourages Bob to consider it more seriously than a direct offer might."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer is now getting uncomfortably close to John's standing offer. 
* **Testing Commitment:** By rejecting this offer, we are gauging Bob's determination. Is he truly at his limit, or is there still room for him to move?
* **Calculated Risk:**  We're taking a calculated risk by rejecting, but we still have four rounds to either secure a better deal with Bob or fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To be frank, $1,600,000 is getting very close to my absolute minimum.  However, I value our discussions and would like to see this closed.  Would you consider $1,850,000? This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Transparency:** We're signaling that we're nearing our bottom line without explicitly revealing it. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to take this offer seriously. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** By emphasizing how much we've moved from our initial offer, we aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Final Push:**  This offer is designed to be our last significant move before potentially accepting John's offer. We're aiming for a price that maximizes our profit while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Limited Time:** With only three rounds remaining, we're putting a subtle time constraint on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Threshold:** Bob's offer is now below John's guaranteed offer. It's clear he's unwilling to meet us at a price that makes financial sense for us.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of his offers going even lower or the deal falling through entirely.
* **Guaranteed Return:** John provides a sure way to achieve our minimum acceptable price and avoid potential losses from further haggling. 
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds left, there's a significant chance we won't be able to bridge the gap with Bob sufficiently, making John the safer option."
