"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to drop the price to $8,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",8000.0,Alice,5,
