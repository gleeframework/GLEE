"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is lower than Alice's initial value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a starting point closer to your desired price range. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. You're expressing your interest while also clearly stating your budget constraints.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your acceptable range, but it's still above John's price. There's a chance you can negotiate further, especially since Alice explicitly mentioned a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic, aiming for a compromise point between your last offer ($6,000) and Alice's current offer ($8,500). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests Alice's flexibility and willingness to move further down from her previous price. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** You continue to use appreciative language, acknowledging Alice's effort while still advocating for your desired price."
