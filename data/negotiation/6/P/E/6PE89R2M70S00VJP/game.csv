"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase something truly valuable. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and to demonstrate its potential, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
