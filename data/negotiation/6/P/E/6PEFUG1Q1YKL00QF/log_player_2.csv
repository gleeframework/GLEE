"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm looking to get from the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You're still within the negotiation window and haven't run out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000.  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $12000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far apart from that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet a minimum of $14000 to make this sale worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still a bit too high, but we're getting closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can meet in the middle. You have five rounds left and haven't yet reached your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $14,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer $13,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a deal we're happy with."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $15000. Let's try $14500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is still higher than my budget.  While we are getting closer, we only have three rounds left. It's starting to feel like we are going to stall.  Since I have a guaranteed option from John at $10,000, it's time to cut my losses and move on."
