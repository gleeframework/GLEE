"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  Starting high allows for potential concessions while still potentially earning a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and maintains my leverage.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $150 is tempting, there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message acknowledges Bob's interest and highlights the value of the product, encouraging him to continue negotiating. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message explicitly seeks a middle ground, showing flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gradually bring Bob's offer closer to my desired price while remaining open to compromise.  The counteroffer of $160 shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a significant portion of my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $140. Can you think about meeting me in the middle at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not being able to close a deal increases.
* **John's Offer is Not Much Higher:**  John's offer is only $10 more than Bob's. While it would be nice to get that extra $10, the risk of losing Bob's offer altogether is too high.

**Strategy:**

It's crucial to weigh the potential of a slightly lower price against the risk of not selling at all. In this situation, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, and I'm still getting close to my minimum acceptable price."
