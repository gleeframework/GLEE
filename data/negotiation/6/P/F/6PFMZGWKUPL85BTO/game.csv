,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $980,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $990,000. Let's see if we can get a deal done.",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $990,000 is still too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet your price, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,000,000. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
