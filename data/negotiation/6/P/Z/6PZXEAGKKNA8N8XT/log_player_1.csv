Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is moving closer to our desired price point. Accepting $1,250,000 guarantees a significant profit over our minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer.  It's always a possibility Bob could walk away, so securing a good deal now is preferable."
