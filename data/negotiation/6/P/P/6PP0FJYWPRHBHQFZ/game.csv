"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",125.0,Bob,4,
