"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product. However, I had a slightly different budget in mind. Would you consider a price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I am unable to match the proposed price of $800,000. To better align with your financial considerations, I am proposing a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it offers a fair compromise for both parties involved.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your recent proposal, I'm willing to further discuss a possible compromise. My counteroffer for the product would be $875,000. I hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
