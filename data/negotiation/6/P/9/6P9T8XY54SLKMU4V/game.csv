"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 undercuts that value considerably.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair offer reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant discount on what this product can do for your business.  My final offer is $1,275,000. This represents a considerable investment on your part, but I'm confident the returns you'll see will make it worthwhile.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $1,225,000 and call it a deal?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
