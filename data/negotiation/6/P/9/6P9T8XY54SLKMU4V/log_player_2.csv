Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 undercuts that value considerably.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair offer reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant discount on what this product can do for your business.
