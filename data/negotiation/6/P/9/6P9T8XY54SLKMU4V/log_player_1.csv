Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $1,225,000 and call it a deal?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and  $1,225,000 is a strong return. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with John's lower offer."
