"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $8,800. This represents a significant step closer to your asking price, and I'm confident we can close this deal with this price.",8800.0,Bob,6,
