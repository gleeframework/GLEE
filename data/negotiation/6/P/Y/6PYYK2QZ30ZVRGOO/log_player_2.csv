"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob.  Bob has a significant margin to work with, and it's worth seeing if he can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still significantly higher than his ideal target. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can likely get the price down even lower by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it would be a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. This is already a very competitive offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $800,000. While Alice's offer is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to counter with a slightly higher offer than his last attempt, keeping the pressure on Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 810000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you the product for $812500. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has a strong incentive to continue negotiating and try to get the price down further. Since he has limited rounds left and has already stated his willingness to go up to $810,000, a counter-offer within that range might push Alice to accept a deal closer to his desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very close to my limit.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go up to $811,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 811250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $822500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you the product for $817000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $817,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $817,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice before he has to buy from John at a much higher price.  While $817,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's a better deal than what John is offering.  There's not much time left to negotiate, and Bob has already shown his willingness to compromise.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best move to secure the product at a price that's still within a reasonable range for Bob."
