"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  You want to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $90?  It's my best offer, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.  You're close to your limit, but you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can agree."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget. You can either accept the offer and get the product, or reject it and risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice. If you reject and Alice makes a counteroffer, it might be even higher than $100. It's safer to accept the offer and get the product for $100.  You can also consider that if you reject this offer, you are going to have to buy the product from Jhon anyway for $100.  Accepting the offer now saves you time and effort, and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
