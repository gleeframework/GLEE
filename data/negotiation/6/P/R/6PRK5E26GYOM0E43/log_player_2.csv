"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth exploring negotiations with Alice to see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is still my ideal target. How about we meet halfway at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still stuck at $8,000. This is what the product is worth to me, and I'm not comfortable going higher. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about this: $9,000, and that's my final offer. It's a strong price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can still get the product from John for $8,000, so there's no reason to settle for a higher price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. My final offer is $8,500.  If we can't meet in the middle, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 8500}
