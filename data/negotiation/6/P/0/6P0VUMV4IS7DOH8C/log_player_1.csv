"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique potential and value"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's above what I know Bob values it at. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John open in case Bob's counteroffers are too low or the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly higher than his stated perceived value. This indicates there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price point closer to $2,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the market value, the product offers significant unique advantages that justify a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reiterating the ""unique advantages"" to keep the focus on the product's value beyond basic market comparisons. 
* **Strategic Movement:**  I'm reducing my price by $150,000, which is a significant concession but keeps me well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Maintaining Alternatives:** I'm still open to selling to John if negotiations stall, but I believe there's a good chance of reaching a more favorable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I still think $1,800,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signs, But Not Enough:** Bob is moving closer to my range, and his willingness to ""meet in the middle"" suggests flexibility. However, $1,900,000 is still below my target, and I believe there's room for him to go higher.
* **Time Considerations:** I have six rounds remaining. While time isn't critical yet, I want to apply some pressure and gauge Bob's seriousness.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll use my next counteroffer to aim slightly above the midpoint between our current positions, testing his willingness to move further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding common ground.  I'm also eager to reach a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,975,000?  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Encouraging Progress:** I acknowledge his effort in meeting halfway and reinforce the shared goal of reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price of $1,975,000 is a carefully calculated point:
    * It's above his offer of $1,900,000, maintaining pressure.
    * It's slightly below the exact midpoint ($1,950,000) to signal a degree of compromise.
    * It's within a potentially acceptable range for me, assuming he's willing to move a bit further.
* **Time Awareness:** I'm conscious that we're past the halfway point in negotiations. This offer aims for a balance between pushing for a better deal and not letting the negotiation drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above that. Can we meet at $1,925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now very close to my acceptable range. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is unlikely to be substantial. The risk of Bob walking away increases if I keep pushing. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides certainty and avoids the risk of the negotiation dragging out further, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome. 

**Overall:** $1,925,000 represents a good deal considering the circumstances, and it's prudent to accept rather than risk losing the sale or leaving a significant amount of money on the table."
