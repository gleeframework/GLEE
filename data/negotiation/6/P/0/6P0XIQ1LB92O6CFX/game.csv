"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking $14,000 would be a more comfortable price for me. Can you meet me at that number?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $14,250 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $14,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $14,250, so I'll offer $14,125. Can we meet at this price?",14125.0,Bob,6,
