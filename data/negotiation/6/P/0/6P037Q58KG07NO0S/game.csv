"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $925,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1 million.  How about $975,000?  This would be a good middle ground for us both.",975000.0,Alice,5,
