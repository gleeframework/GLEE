"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11500? It's a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

How about we try $11750? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000.",11750.0,Alice,5,
