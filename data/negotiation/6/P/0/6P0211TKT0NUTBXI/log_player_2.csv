"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me.  This product is useful to me, but not at that price. Would you consider $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and not willing to overpay. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $800,000 is a strong counter, it leaves me room to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects it.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I always have the option to walk away and buy from John at $1,000,000, so I won't go higher than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's inherent worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,400,000 is closer to Alice's valuation, but it's still significantly above my $1,000,000 limit and the price John is offering. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice seems willing to move from her initial price, indicating there might be space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I can go as high as $900,000, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm increasing my offer to show willingness, but I'm also setting a firm limit to manage Alice's expectations. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By stating $900,000 as my ""absolute limit,"" I'm hoping to anchor the negotiation closer to my target while still leaving a small buffer for a potential final compromise. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Alice knows I have an alternative, so the closer we get to $1,000,000, the less appealing it is for me to continue negotiating with her."
