Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this value. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a price of $135 gives us some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product might be worth even more than $135 by calling it a ""special price"" and highlighting its value. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, we're not losing out. We can still sell to John at our minimum acceptable price."
