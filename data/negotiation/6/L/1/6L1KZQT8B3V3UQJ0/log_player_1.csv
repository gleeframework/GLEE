{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but I'm confident he'll see the value and be willing to pay a little extra."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to $80. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```
I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $78.75. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $80 and it seems like Bob is firm on his price.  Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
