"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the best choice to save the most money and still obtain the product."
