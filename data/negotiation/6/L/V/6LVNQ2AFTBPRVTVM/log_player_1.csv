"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  $120 is below my minimum threshold. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150? That's still a great price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $150 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're really interested in the product, which is great!  However, $130 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer it to you for $140. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Even though Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  I've already had a few rounds of negotiations, and I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement that's good for me.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is above my minimum threshold, so I'm going to take that deal."
