"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm starting the price at $150, but I'm open to negotiations.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is your maximum price, there's no reason to accept it immediately. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is my absolute maximum, but I'd love to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  A significant counteroffer (like $125) demonstrates your seriousness about negotiating while leaving room for compromise. 
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a reason for your offer helps keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  The ""How about..."" phrasing keeps the door open for Alice to suggest a price closer to yours."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has moved from $150 to $135, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Your Budget:** This price is still within your budget of $150. 
* **Time is Money:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you're already saving $15. It's a good deal considering your time constraint."
