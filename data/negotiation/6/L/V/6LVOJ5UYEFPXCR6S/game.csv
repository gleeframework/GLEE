"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you attribute to it. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budgetary constraints. However, $950,000 is significantly below the value I know this product can bring to your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a fair return while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
