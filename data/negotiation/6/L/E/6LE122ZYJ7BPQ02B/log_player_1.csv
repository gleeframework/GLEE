Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more to Bob than his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Context:** If similar products are readily available at lower prices, you might need to adjust your strategy."
