"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. Given its quality and uniqueness, we believe it's worth more than $150. Considering its value to you, would you be interested in purchasing it for $140?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I recognize its value, the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $125 for the product? This is still above what you're willing to pay but closer to my asking price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $110. Would you be willing to meet me there?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a fair compromise. How about we set the price at $115 for the product? It's higher than your last offer but lower than my initial asking price. This should be a win-win situation for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
