"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by previous customers. Given its quality and uniqueness, we believe it's worth more than $150. Considering its value to you, would you be interested in purchasing it for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I recognize its value, the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is polite and acknowledges the product's value while still clearly stating my price limit. 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Alice's flexibility.
* Potentially secure a great deal early on.
* Set the stage for a compromise within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $125 for the product? This is still above what you're willing to pay but closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $110. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm holding firm below my $120 walk-away point to maintain leverage. 
* **Clear Target:** By stating a specific price ($110), I'm giving Alice a clear target to consider.
* **Expressing Willingness:** The tone remains positive and suggests I'm ready to close the deal if we can find that sweet spot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a fair compromise. How about we set the price at $115 for the product? It's higher than your last offer but lower than my initial asking price. This should be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $115 is a reasonable compromise, only $5 more than John's offer. 
* **Time Factor:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to push might not yield much more, and we risk Alice hardening her stance. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows a willingness to meet in the middle, which can be good for future interactions."
