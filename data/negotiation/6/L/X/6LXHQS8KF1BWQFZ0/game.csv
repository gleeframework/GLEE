,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,500 is pushing my limit.  Would you consider $12,800? This reflects my desire to make a deal.",12800.0,Alice,5,
