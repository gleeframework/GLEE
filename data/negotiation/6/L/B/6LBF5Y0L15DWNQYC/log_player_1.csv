"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. However, $100 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $107?"", ""product_price"": 107}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting stuck with a worse offer from Bob."
