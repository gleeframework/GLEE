I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John will buy it for that amount. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than his initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go lower than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $115.  This is a compromise from my initial price and closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal, but I'm still willing to walk away if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already negotiated a bit and I don't want to risk going too much lower. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
