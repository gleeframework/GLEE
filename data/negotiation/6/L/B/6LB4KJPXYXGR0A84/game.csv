"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking to stay within the range of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1000000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $1120000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
