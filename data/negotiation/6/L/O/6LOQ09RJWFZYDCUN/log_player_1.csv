"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $950,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay a premium since the product is worth $800,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe Bob will see this as a reasonable price, given his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and this is a good deal considering the product's value to him.  I'm happy to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
