"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let me know if this works for you!",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $17,000, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14,000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I think $16,500 is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you!",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $14,500.  That's the best I can do.",14500.0,Bob,6,
