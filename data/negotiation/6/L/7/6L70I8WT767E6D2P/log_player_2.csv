"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a significant amount to you. Let me know what you think. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. While Alice mentions another buyer, there's no guarantee they'll pay $10,000, and it's irrelevant to your best possible price.  You should reject this offer and proceed with buying from John."
