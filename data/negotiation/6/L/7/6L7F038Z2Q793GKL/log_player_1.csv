Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone with your needs, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without losing him to a counter-offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justify the Price:** By highlighting the product's value *specifically* to Bob, we make the price seem more reasonable. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving us with a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
