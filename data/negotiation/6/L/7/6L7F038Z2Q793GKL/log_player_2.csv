# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone with your needs, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $925,000.
* It's better to reject her offer because you can get the same product from John for only $75,000 more ($1,000,000 - $925,000 = $75,000)."
