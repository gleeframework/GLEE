Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000, which is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my budget. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again.  While I could buy from John for $12,000, there is still room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget of $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product at my desired price from John."
