"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its long-term benefits for your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but our valuations are still quite far apart. I can go up to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering we're still in the early stages of negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This offer reflects the significant value it will bring to your operations.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
