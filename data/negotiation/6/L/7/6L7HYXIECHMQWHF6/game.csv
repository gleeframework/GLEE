"Alice, your product looks interesting, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1400000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go to $1250000.  This is a good compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
