"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks interesting, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $1400000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer, it's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down further. It's also worth noting that Bob has the option to buy from John for a lower price, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1350000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there are still rounds left to negotiate, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to Bob's desired price point.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John, who is offering it at his maximum budget."
