"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 wouldn't be fair to its potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true worth of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that takes both of our positions into account.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While I value your willingness to negotiate, I'm still seeking a price that truly reflects the product's worth.  Would you be open to considering $1,030,000? This represents a significant concession on my part while hopefully acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
