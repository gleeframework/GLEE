"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1200000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This represents a fair compromise, and it allows us to both move forward with this opportunity.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1275000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
