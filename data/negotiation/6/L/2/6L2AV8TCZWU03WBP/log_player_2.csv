"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price point ($15,000).** You want to save money.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.**  This gives you the chance to bring the price down closer to your desired range. 
* **Buying from John is an option, but it's not the best choice yet.**  Negotiating with Alice could potentially get you a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** $13,750 is less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.**  Alice has already moved closer to your desired price point.
* **Buying from John is a less desirable option.** You'd be paying more than what Alice is offering. 

While you could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might reject your offer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the current offer ensures a purchase within your budget."
