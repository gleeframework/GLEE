"Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is $80.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider selling the product for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
