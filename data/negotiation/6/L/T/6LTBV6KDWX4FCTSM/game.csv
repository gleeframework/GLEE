"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is significantly lower than my asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000.  It's my absolute maximum, but I think it's fair given the value to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
