{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to someone like you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), providing room for negotiation.
    * Lower than John's offer ($1,200,000), making it more enticing for Bob.
* **Strong Initial Offer:**  Starting high allows for potential concessions during negotiation, increasing the likelihood of reaching a price closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as beneficial for Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your absolute bottom line should be $1,200,000 (John's offer) to ensure you don't lose money."
