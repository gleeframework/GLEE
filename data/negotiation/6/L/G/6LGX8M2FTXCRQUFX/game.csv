"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would allow us both to make a good profit, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
