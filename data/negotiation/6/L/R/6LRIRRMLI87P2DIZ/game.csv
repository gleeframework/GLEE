"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no more than that. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
