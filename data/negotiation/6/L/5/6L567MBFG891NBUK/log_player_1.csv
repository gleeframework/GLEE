"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is still above Bob's offer of $80 and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to earn a decent profit, while also encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  With only a few rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $100 just yet. I'll see if I can convince Bob to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm making one final attempt to get a price I'm comfortable with before considering selling to John. I'm lowering my price to $100, which is still above Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob doesn't accept this, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I don't have much room for negotiation. While Bob's offer of $98 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time and want to secure a guaranteed profit.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's not the highest price, but it's a safe and reliable deal."
