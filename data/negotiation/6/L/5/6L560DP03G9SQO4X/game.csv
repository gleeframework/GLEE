"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
