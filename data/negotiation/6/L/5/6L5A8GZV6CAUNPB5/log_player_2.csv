"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly below its true value to you. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to acquire something that will bring you a substantial return.  I'm confident you'll recognize the value here.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high.  There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
