"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering your interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,000 is still more than I had in mind. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,000 is closer, but still a bit low.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
