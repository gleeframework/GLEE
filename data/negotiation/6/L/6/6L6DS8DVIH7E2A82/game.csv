"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a solid return on my investment.  Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,090,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. Let's seal the deal!",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
