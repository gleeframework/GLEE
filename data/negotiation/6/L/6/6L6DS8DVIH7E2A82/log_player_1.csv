Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge further. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on any deal."
