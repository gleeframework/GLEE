"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $17,000. I would like to propose a price of $15,000. This is still above my initial offer, but as close as I can get to your original price while staying within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,4,
