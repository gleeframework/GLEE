Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I believe it will be very valuable for you, but I'm looking to make a quick sale. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer the product at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($150) creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit high."
