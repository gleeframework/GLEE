"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price that I believe is a fair compromise between its value to me and its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,100,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though Alice values the product at $800,000, it's more important to focus on your own budget and the potential savings."
