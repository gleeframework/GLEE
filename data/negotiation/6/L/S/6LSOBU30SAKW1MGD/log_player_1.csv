"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your needs. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** My opening message hints at the product's value but avoids specific claims. This gives Bob the opportunity to reveal more about his valuation during the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's expressed interest, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  Would you consider $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Ground:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate but stand firm that his initial price is too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** By offering to meet ""halfway,"" I'm making a significant concession (from $2,200,000), which might encourage Bob to do the same. However, I'm still keeping the price well above both his offer and my absolute minimum.
* **Continued Emphasis on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential value, hoping to nudge his perception closer to mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side to justify going below my guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair offer considering the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Towards My Minimum:** I'm strategically placing my offer just above my guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). This maintains a small profit margin while significantly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Compromise and Fairness:**  The message emphasizes that I'm making a major concession while still reiterating the product's value. This framing aims to make Bob view the offer as reasonable and incentivize him to close the deal.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, time pressure is building. Bob might be more willing to compromise to avoid missing out on the product altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't see him bridging the $50,000 gap.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John.  While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away and the potential time lost in further negotiation isn't worth the potential upside.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
