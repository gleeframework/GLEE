"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.  Would you consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product. How about we settle at $1,550,000? This is a significant compromise on my end and a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this number.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
