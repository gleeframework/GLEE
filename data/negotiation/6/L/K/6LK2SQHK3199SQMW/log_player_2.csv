"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a serious buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this product is worth at least that to you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a profit, so let's discuss the price of $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is starting the negotiation far above your maximum price and is aware that the product is worth significantly less to you.  You have a guaranteed option with John at a much lower price. There's no point in negotiating with Alice."
