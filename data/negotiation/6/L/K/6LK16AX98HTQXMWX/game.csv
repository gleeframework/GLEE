"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, and propose a price of $1,075,000.  This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
