{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential back-and-forth while still keeping me in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target, aiming for a final price closer to $1,100,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, and propose a price of $1,075,000.  This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Given my financial situation, I am unable to meet your latest proposal at $1,075,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,060,000 is a good compromise.  It's very close to my desired price of $1,075,000, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a higher offer from Bob. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is more lucrative, the additional $40,000 isn't worth the risk of losing a sale altogether. It's better to secure the sale now and move on."
