"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $780,000. This is my final offer - it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  Let me know your decision.",780000.0,Alice,5,
