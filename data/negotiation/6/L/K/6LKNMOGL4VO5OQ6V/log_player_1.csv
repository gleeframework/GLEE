{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a fantastic product at a price that's still below its full market value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $750,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $875,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $825,000 is still a good deal considering I could sell to John for $800,000.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing Bob and ending up with the lower price from John."
