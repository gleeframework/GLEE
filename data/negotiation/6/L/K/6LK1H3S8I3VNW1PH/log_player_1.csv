Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer sets the price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  However, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is truly interested, he might counter with a price closer to my minimum, giving us room to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer isn't a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. It allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Protect my interests:**  The offer ensures I won't settle for less than $1,500,000, as I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Increase my potential earnings:** A counteroffer could lead to a higher price, getting me closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Explore other options:** While I could sell to John, I'm not willing to give up on potentially getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my bottom line. 
* **Creates pressure:** By lowering the price from my initial offer, I put some pressure on Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer. 
* **Leaves room for a final deal:** This price point leaves some space for a final deal that satisfies both of our needs, if Bob is willing to compromise.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be enough to reach a final agreement with Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,350,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I am willing to negotiate, it seems Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway. 

Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum target, and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to budge. 

Therefore, selling to John is the best option at this point, securing a profitable transaction and avoiding potential further losses."
