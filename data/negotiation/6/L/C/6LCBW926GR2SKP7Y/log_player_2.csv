"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He can offer a price closer to Alice's valuation of $800,000, potentially saving a significant amount of money compared to accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal, so he starts by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. He offers $850,000, which is closer to Alice's valuation of $800,000 but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer allows for a middle ground and provides an opportunity for Alice to accept while still ensuring Bob saves a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate and making another counteroffer.  Bob should aim for a price closer to $850,000 or lower, but should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He has already offered $850,000, and Alice has countered at $900,000. Offering $875,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's previous offer. This counteroffer could potentially lead to a successful negotiation and a price that benefits both parties."
