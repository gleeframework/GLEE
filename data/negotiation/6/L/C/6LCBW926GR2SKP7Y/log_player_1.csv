Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000,  but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to work with you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired range. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $900,000 is still a fair price considering the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what I could get from John, and the negotiations have taken enough time. It's time to finalize the deal."
