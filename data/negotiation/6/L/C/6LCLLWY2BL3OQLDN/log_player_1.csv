Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $120 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher gives you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Appeal to Value:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at its worth to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

This offer aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
