"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $7,000, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm trying to make a profit, after all! This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
