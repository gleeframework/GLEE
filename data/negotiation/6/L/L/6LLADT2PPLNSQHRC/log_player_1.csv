{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but still allows me to make a profit above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a significant discount from what you initially estimated the product's worth to be. Let's try to work something out!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

$10,250 is a fair compromise and is very close to my desired price point. I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
