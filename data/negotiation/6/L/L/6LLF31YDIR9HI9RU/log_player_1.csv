"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $135 is more than your minimum of $150, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  $135 is still below Bob's value of $120, making it a potentially appealing offer.
* **It's a strong opening:** A clear and positive message accompanied by a reasonable price sets a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I would like to get a higher price, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I will try to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find a solution we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  My counteroffer of $130 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate. It's only $5 above Bob's offer, indicating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining value:** $130 is still above my minimum price of $150, so I'm not sacrificing too much. 
* **Positive message:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution we both agree on, keeping the negotiation friendly and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $127.50. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $127.50 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $130. I will counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference at $128.75? It's a small step closer to a deal, and it's a price that's fair for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 128.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a compromise:** By suggesting a split of the difference, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $128.75 is still above my minimum of $150, but it's getting closer to Bob's range.
* **Maintaining optimism:** The message remains positive and encourages a deal, hopefully leading to an agreement in the next round."
