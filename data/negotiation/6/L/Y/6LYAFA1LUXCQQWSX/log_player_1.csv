Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 9,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000, I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer.
