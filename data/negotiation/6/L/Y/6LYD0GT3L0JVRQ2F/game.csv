"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $11000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500. It's a fair price for a great product!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12500? It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still think $12500 is a bit low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
