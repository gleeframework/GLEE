"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still leaves you a substantial profit margin.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $875,000. Can we try $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
