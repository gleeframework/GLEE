"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal and me to earn a fair price. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
