``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then counter with a higher offer, or if his counteroffer isn't acceptable, I can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  This gives me a better chance of getting closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiations open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $900,000 is too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is still a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price. It's important to keep pushing for a better price while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already compromised significantly.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly clear that we won't reach an agreement.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I achieve my financial goal and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
