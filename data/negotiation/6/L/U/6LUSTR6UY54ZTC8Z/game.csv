"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers both of our interests. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This allows for a mutually beneficial transaction and keeps us both happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",975000.0,Bob,4,
