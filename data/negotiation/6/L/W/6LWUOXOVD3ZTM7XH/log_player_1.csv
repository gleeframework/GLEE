Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I consider a fair price for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows me to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a more favorable price for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're being stubborn, but I'm still open to a deal. How about $1,200,000?  That's my bottom line. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a decent profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
