"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $125 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to still get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $135 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
