,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $12,000. This feels like a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,000? That would make this a really attractive deal for me.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? That's my absolute bottom line.",10000.0,Alice,5,
