"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a potentially better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm interested in the product, but I'm really hoping to get it closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price:** $11,000 is only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500.
* **The risk of rejecting and counteroffering again:** There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and each round increases the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  
* **John's offer is still a fallback option:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he can still buy from John for $12,000.

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible move in this round."
