"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.  How about $1,250,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value this product holds, and it gives me a reasonable profit as well.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
