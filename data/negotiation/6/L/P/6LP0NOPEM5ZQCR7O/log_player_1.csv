Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $120 value as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

**Why not lower?**

Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($80) would leave too much potential profit on the table. You have a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's little incentive to drastically undervalue the product."
