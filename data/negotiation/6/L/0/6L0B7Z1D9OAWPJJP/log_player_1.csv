"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a deal that benefits both parties, it increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. You have several rounds left, and there's a good chance you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum price of $12,000 and closer to your desired price.  While you could try for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might reject your next counteroffer and you might end up selling to John for $12,000."
