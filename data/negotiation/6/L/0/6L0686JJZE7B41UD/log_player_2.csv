"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's closer to your maximum price ($1,200,000) than her minimum price ($800,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** This is good to keep in mind, but you're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to her desired price ($800,000) than your maximum price ($1,200,000).
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Even though Alice offered to meet you ""halfway,"" there's still a gap between your offer and hers.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but keeping the option to buy from John gives you leverage."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $885,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. I believe this price is still a good compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.** While $885,000 is still above your last counteroffer, it's only $15,000 more.
* **There's a high chance Alice won't budge further.**  She's already made significant concessions, and her message indicates she's at her limit. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** However, it's a more expensive solution.  
* **Accepting Alice's offer is the best balance of saving money and getting the product.**  It's a good compromise that allows both of you to walk away with a reasonable deal."
