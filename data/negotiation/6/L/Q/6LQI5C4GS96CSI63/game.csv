"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price that aligns with my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the immense value this product holds.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my end and a fair deal considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
