Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the initial offer. You can always negotiate down if Bob counters, knowing you have a secure fallback option with John."
