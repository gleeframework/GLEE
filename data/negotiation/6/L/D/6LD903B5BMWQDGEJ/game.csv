"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
