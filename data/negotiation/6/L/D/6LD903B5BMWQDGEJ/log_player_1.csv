Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is higher than $100, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not giving it away. 
* **It's a clear price:** It avoids any ambiguity about the price.

I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but this is a good starting point to see where the negotiation goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $105 is less than my minimum of $120.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. There's room to counter-offer and potentially reach an agreement closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I'm comfortable with the backup plan of selling to John for $120, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $107.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $107.50 is still below my desired price.  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful:** Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, and I don't think further negotiation will get me closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees I get my minimum, avoiding any further risk.

**Conclusion:** It's better to secure the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with an even lower price."
