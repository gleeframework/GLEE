"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but that's still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,225,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer and pay $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,210,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
