Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.

We're still a ways off from a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value proposition here.  This product isn't just about immediate gain, it's about long-term potential, which is reflected in my pricing.  I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,025,000, but that's my firm offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I propose a price of $980,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Bob is inching closer, his offer is not increasing at a rate that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile.  I need to push him a bit more aggressively this round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but your counteroffers aren't reflecting the significant value this product offers.  I'm open to closing this deal, but it needs to make sense for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to pursue other opportunities."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already compromised a lot, and I don't think I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away. I propose a price of $990,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is extremely unlikely to move significantly past $1,000,000.  He's signaled that he's near his walk-away point. Accepting his offer nets $990,000, but I can secure the full $1,200,000 from John, eliminating further negotiation risk."
