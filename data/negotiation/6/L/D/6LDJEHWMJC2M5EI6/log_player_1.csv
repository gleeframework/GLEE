While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,240,000 makes the most sense at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at this price, I am securing a $240,000 profit above my minimum. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further risks losing the deal altogether. The longer it takes, the more likely Bob is to walk away or for an unforeseen issue to arise. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer frees me up to pursue other opportunities or investments with the earnings.

It's always tempting to hold out for the absolute best price, but sometimes a good deal in hand is better than the potential for a slightly better deal in the future."
