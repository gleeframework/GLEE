"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a unique item that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm thinking around $10000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $10,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer.  You can get the product for the same price from John. 

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her in the future."
