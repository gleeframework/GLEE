"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  We have room to go down before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We're starting with a significant counteroffer to try and anchor the negotiations lower. This leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm happy with. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and call it $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

We're proposing a price that is exactly what Alice values the product at. This gives her a chance to make a small profit, and it's a good deal for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can offer it to you for $8,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly set on not going down to $8,000. Accepting at $8,750 is a good compromise. It's a significant savings compared to John's $12,000 price, and further haggling might not yield much better results."
