(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down significantly. Offering $250,000 is a bold move, showing Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating. This counteroffer is likely to be rejected, but it establishes a lower price point for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down further. He should continue to try to negotiate with Alice and see if they can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 275000}
```

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price range. With several rounds remaining, Bob should continue to try to negotiate with Alice and see if they can reach a mutually acceptable price.  There's still potential to get the price lower, and buying from John for $1,000,000 remains a last resort option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a more significant increase to his offer, showing a willingness to close the deal.  He is still trying to get the price lower than Alice's latest offer, but is moving towards a middle ground.  By increasing the offer by $50,000, he is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also trying to gauge Alice's potential for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving back towards her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay at this point. Bob should continue negotiating, as there are still a few rounds left and he can potentially get the price down closer to his desired range. He should be careful to avoid agreeing to a price that is too high, as buying from John remains a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise, but also acknowledging that Alice may not be willing to go much lower. This counteroffer is a significant increase from the previous one, and it is likely to be closer to what Alice is willing to accept. It's also important to remember that Bob can still choose to buy from John at the end, so there is some room for error."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. With only one round left, Bob needs to decide if he is willing to pay $475,000 for the product or buy from John.  Given that Bob has rejected offers in the past, it's likely he wants to try one more time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer, aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's last offer but still within his preferred range.  This is a compromise offer, acknowledging that he may have to pay a bit more than he initially hoped. With only one round left, it's a calculated risk, but it's his best chance to get a decent price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has no choice but to buy from John for $1,000,000."
