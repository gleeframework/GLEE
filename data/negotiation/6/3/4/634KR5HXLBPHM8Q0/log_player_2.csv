"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a better deal than $100 from John, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $90 is still more than his desired price. By rejecting the offer, he can continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but I'm not sure $90 is quite there yet.  Let's split the difference - how about $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
