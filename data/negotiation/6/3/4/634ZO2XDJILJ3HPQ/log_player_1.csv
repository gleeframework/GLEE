Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""we can discuss further"" signals to Bob that you're open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial offer, you gain a significant profit.
* **Provides Negotiation Buffer:**  Even if Bob counters, you have room to negotiate down towards $1,500,000 (your guaranteed sale price with John). 
* **Preserves the John Option:** If Bob rejects your final negotiated offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
