Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but if he accepts, I'll have secured a good price while still leaving some room for a potential better offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and it's clear he's unwilling to meet me halfway. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned about further lowering the price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, making it the most sensible option."
