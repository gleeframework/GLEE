Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob knows exactly what's being offered and what's expected of him. 

I'm open to adjusting my offer based on Bob's response, but this initial offer positions me strongly for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would result in a considerable financial loss for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially with John waiting in the wings. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid a potentially longer and less fruitful negotiation."
