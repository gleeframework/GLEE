* **Your Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $950,000 
* **John's Price:** $1,000,000
* **Analysis:** Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $1,000,000. However, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John means you are paying $50,000 more. 

It's always better to reject an offer if you can get a better deal elsewhere."
