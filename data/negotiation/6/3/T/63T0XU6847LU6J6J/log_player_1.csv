Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I'm comfortable selling to John for $800,000, so this is my floor.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I know I can get a price closer to that than my minimum.
* **Negotiation space:**  A price of $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is hesitant, but still gives me a significant profit. 

This offer is aggressive but not unreasonable, giving me a strong chance of maximizing my earnings while still being within Bob's acceptable range."
