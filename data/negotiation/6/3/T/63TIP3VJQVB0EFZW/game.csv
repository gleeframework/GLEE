"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1200000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'm proposing a new price of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.
