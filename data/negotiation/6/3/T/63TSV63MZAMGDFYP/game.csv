,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but that's still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $975,000? That's the best I can do right now.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $950,000? That's the best I can do right now.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I'm close to accepting, $950,000 is still a little below what I'm aiming for. Let's meet in the middle, how about $975,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement this round.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $925,000? That's the best I can do right now.",925000.0,Bob,8,
