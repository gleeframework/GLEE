Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer, close to the middle ground between our valuations. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Optimistic Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this deal is beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, there's still a significant gap ($100,000).  
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have plenty of room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to continue negotiating to find a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but that's still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving halfway from my previous offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get, emphasizing that this price is still a great deal.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen!"", encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and making a reasonable concession to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about $975,000? That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm confident I can do better. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still have leverage, as Bob is clearly interested in the product. He's already made two counteroffers, indicating his willingness to continue the negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John now would be a safe choice, but it's not the most profitable.  I have time and the opportunity to push for a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price somewhere between $975,000 and $1,050,000, continuing to bridge the gap between our valuations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm not budging too much on my previous offer, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's position.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm emphasizing the need to find a solution that benefits both parties, making the negotiation collaborative.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the ""fair price"" and how it ""gets us closer to a deal,"" making the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to maintain my desired price while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. It's a calculated risk, but it might push Bob to make a final concession."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $950,000? That's the best I can do right now.

I'm hoping we can come to an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```
