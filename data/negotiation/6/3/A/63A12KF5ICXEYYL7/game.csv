"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  I'm sure we can both find this to be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've acknowledged it has to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to close the deal closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?  That's a good compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,060,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've acknowledged it has to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
