"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $120. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $130 is closer to my budget, I still can't commit to that price. Could we possibly agree on $125? It would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still showing appreciation for the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
