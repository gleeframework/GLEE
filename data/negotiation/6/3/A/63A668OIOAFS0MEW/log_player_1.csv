Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price above what Bob is willing to pay, but below what you consider your minimum. This gives some room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $120. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is lower than what you consider the product's worth, it's still reasonable to consider. However, you can try to get a bit more.  You are not desperate for a sale, as John is willing to buy the product at a much better price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $130 is closer to my budget, I still can't commit to that price. Could we possibly agree on $125? It would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still showing appreciation for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still not quite enough.  Since John is willing to buy the product for $150, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob."
