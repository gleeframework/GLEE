"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
