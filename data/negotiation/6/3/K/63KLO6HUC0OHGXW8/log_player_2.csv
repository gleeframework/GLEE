"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our offer is still above Alice's value for the product ($70 vs. $80), giving her an incentive to consider it.
* **Time Consideration:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $82? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $82 is still above our target. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  We're slowly increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're doing it in small increments.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** $75 is a fair price that sits comfortably between Alice's valuation ($80) and our initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Negotiation Power:** We still have plenty of rounds left, so we're not in a rush to settle. This allows us to maintain some negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still need to make a bit more. How about we try $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is clearly signaling that she's getting close to her minimum price. 
* **Minimal Savings Elsewhere:** While we might be able to squeeze out another dollar or two, the difference is negligible at this point. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice backing out or our offers becoming too close to John's price.  

It's best to secure the deal now at a price well below our maximum and John's offer."
