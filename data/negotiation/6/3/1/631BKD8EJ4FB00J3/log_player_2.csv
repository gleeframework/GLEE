"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is well above your budget of $10,000. It's worth rejecting and negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm able to go at this time."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your budget of $10,000.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for Alice to come down in price, and you might be able to reach a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a bit higher than your offer. How about $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still outside your budget. While it's closer to your desired price, you're still better off continuing to negotiate, especially since you're only on round 5.  There's a good chance you can still convince Alice to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $15,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This is the most I can do at this time."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $16,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above your budget.  You've already made several counteroffers and have gone through a significant portion of the negotiation rounds.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases.  It's more prudent to go with the guaranteed price from John at this point, which is well within your budget."
