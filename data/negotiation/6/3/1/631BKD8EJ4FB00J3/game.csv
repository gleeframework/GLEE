"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for the product?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm able to go at this time.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a bit higher than your offer. How about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $15,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This is the most I can do at this time.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $16,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",16500.0,Alice,7,
