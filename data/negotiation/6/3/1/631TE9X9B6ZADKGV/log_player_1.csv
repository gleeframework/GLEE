"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Explanation:

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is substantial, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. The product holds significant value, exceeding even Bob's perceived worth. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, but I believe securing a price closer to my target within the remaining rounds is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down slightly to $980,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Explanation:**

*  We're aiming to create a sense of urgency and value while still negotiating within a reasonable range. 
* Dropping the price by $20,000 shows flexibility but maintains a strong position.
* Highlighting the ""competitive price"" and ""potential benefits"" reinforces the product's value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. However, we are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter-offer again, pushing him a bit closer to my target range. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds since John's offer acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's find a middle ground. How about $970,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging our negotiation."", 
""product_price"": 970000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This message aims to create a collaborative atmosphere by acknowledging Bob's effort and proposing a price that splits the difference between the previous offers.
* **Justification:**  Instead of just stating a price, we're justifying it by highlighting it as a balanced solution that recognizes both the product's value and the negotiation process.
* **Creating Urgency:**  With each round, the possibility of me accepting John's offer increases, and this message subtly implies that Bob needs to move closer to my price if he wants to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $965,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

We're getting close! Bob is clearly committed to the deal, but that $5,000 difference is still significant. I believe I can get him closer to $970,000 with a well-placed counteroffer, especially since we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation window."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $967,500? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value we both bring to the table."", 
""product_price"": 967500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** Suggesting a split of the difference positions the offer as mutually beneficial and emphasizes fairness.
* **Urgency:**  The clock is ticking, and framing this offer as potentially the last one before I reconsider John's offer adds a subtle layer of urgency. 
* **Finality:** The wording suggests a desire to conclude the negotiation amicably and efficiently, prompting a decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. After further deliberation, I would like to suggest a price of $962,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's time to exercise my alternative. While Bob is engaged, his increments are getting smaller and we're running out of rounds. The potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are now outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.  It's a tough decision, but strategically the right one for maximizing profit."
