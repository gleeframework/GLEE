Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This price reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price of $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Alice seems firm on a price that's not significantly better than John's offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
