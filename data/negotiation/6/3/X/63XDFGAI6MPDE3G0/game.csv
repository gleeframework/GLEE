"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This price reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However,  $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,100,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits and risks.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price of $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
