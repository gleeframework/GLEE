"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Buying from John would be more expensive, so it's not the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value for the product. This should prompt further negotiation and hopefully lead to a price that's more favorable for me.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above her value and there's still room for negotiation.  There's no need to accept the offer yet. Buying from John is still a less favorable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to pay a fair price.  It's a good middle ground and might encourage Alice to accept."
