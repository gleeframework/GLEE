# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. As we've discussed, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?
