,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to walk away, Bob, but I'm not ready to let the deal slip away yet.

I think this is a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider.",9900.0,Alice,9,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $9800, and you've already offered me $9900 twice. I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm going to have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",9800.0,Bob,10,
