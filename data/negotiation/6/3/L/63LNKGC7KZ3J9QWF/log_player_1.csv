Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering it just below your guaranteed price ($1,190,000) tempts Bob with a potential ""deal"" while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's perceived $1,000,000 valuation, potentially swaying him. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
