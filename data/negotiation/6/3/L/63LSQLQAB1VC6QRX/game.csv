"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me and the potential for further negotiations.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
