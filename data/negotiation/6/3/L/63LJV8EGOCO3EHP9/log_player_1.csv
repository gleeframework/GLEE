Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Goal:**  Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible without alienating Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is still a strong incentive. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he's willing to pay more than your guaranteed amount.
* **No Ultimatum:** The message avoids language like ""final offer"" to keep the negotiation open if Bob counters.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,125,000) to allow room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive approach might be better.
