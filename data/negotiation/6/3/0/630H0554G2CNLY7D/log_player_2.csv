Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $11,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's a better price than John is offering, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result."
