{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,500, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. I want to see if I can get close to my target price, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  The message is friendly and inviting to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try to get closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. Could we do $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
