``` 
 
I'm offering Bob the product for $100. This is a price that is still higher than what the product is worth to him ($80), but it is also a price that I am willing to accept since it is less than what I could sell it to John for ($120). This strategy leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer but ensures that I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me, especially since it's higher than the product's value to him. Accepting ensures I make a profit, and it's more efficient than going back and forth with counteroffers."
