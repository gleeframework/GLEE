Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. My asking price is $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $175. This is above Bob's perceived value but gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm positive and friendly.  I highlight the value of the product and subtly imply it's a good deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value ($150) as possible. 
* By starting high, I have more room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value of $150, and it's not even close to his own perceived value of $80.  There's no point in accepting such a low offer when I can potentially get a much better price. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise.
* I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't become more reasonable."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply not enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $120.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $120, which is halfway between my minimum value of $150 and Bob's offer of $60. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge his desire for a good deal but emphasize that my offer is still fair, especially compared to his initial offer. I'm also framing it as a collaborative effort to find a compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price. 
* I'm staying firm on a price that is still above my minimum value.
* I'm  encouraging Bob to be reasonable and work towards a compromise. 
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It also doesn't seem like he's seriously considering my position, as he's only offered $5 more than his initial lowball offer.  I'm not going to sell the product at a loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $120 or above. If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'm prepared to sell to John and avoid further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we both agree on, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you.  Let's finalize this and avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $75. It's a significant increase from his offer but still a good deal for him, considering his perceived value of $80.
* **Message:** I'm still acknowledging Bob's efforts to negotiate, but I'm firm in my stance. I'm highlighting the fairness of my offer and using language like ""finalizing"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* I'm trying to push Bob towards a more reasonable price by offering him a significant increase from his previous offer.
* I'm using strong language to express my intention to finalize the deal and avoid further delays.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John and avoid further negotiations."
