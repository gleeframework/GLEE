"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal. However, I've had other interested parties in the past who were willing to pay $14,000 for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
