"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,200,001, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is very close to your maximum price. It's worth exploring if you can get it lower. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, I'm currently unable to meet that price.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can currently afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is within my budget and a good deal considering my maximum was $1,200,000.  I'm saving $50,000 compared to buying from John.  There's still room for negotiation, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
