"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $950,000 to you. We're confident this is a fair and attractive offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high ($950,000). It's very close to your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation.
* You know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($800,000). 
* You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better price.
* While buying from John is an option, you should try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Justification:** You've provided a reason for the lower offer (a ""tighter budget"") without revealing too much information.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a large gap between your offer and Alice's last price, allowing for back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we consider an offer of $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $850,000 is still significantly above her perceived value of the product ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have time and rounds on your side to negotiate further. Alice is clearly willing to come down on the price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Accepting this offer might signal that you're willing to pay a premium, which could hurt you in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  You're moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise, but in smaller increments.
* **Target Range:** The $750,000 offer keeps you within a reasonable distance of both your initial offer and Alice's lowered price, aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""Would that price point be feasible?"" encourages Alice to consider your offer seriously and potentially counter with a price closer to your range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. Considering your feedback, how about we offer you the product for $825,000? This is our best offer within the range you've specified. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down:** While Alice's price is getting closer to a reasonable point, she reduced her offer by a smaller amount than before ($25,000 instead of $50,000).  This could indicate she's reaching her lower limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, you can gauge how much further she's willing to negotiate. It might prompt a more aggressive counter-offer from her, closer to her $800,000 value. 
* **Safety Net:** You still have several rounds left, and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement on price. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling for this is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff:** You've reached Alice's estimated value for the product. This offer forces her to decide if she's willing to accept a small profit or risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Urgency and Decisiveness:**  By stating you're ""ready to close the deal today,"" you create a sense of urgency and demonstrate a strong interest in finalizing the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** You haven't explicitly mentioned John, but Alice is likely aware you have other options. This offer subtly reminds her of that without using it as a direct threat."
