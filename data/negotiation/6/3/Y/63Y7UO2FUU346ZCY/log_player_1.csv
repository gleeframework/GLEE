Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth nearly that much.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

While $600,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,900,000? This takes into account the product's true value and potential for significant returns."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a big gap. I can go up to $800,000, but that's absolutely my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his final offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's clear we won't reach an agreement that satisfies us both. It's more profitable for me to sell to John at my desired price."
