"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,450,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This is a significant discount from your asking price, but still a fair value for the product in my opinion.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
