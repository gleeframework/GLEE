Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a solid deal.  It's still well above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident this will be a successful transaction."
