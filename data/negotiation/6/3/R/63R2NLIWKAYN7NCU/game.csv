"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe my initial offer of $1,350,000 is more reflective of its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  Would you be open to that?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
