"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your consideration. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $850,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $900,000 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, as you value it at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I value the product at $1,000,000, but I'm committed to staying within my budget. I would like to counter your offer with $875,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions.",875000.0,Bob,4,
