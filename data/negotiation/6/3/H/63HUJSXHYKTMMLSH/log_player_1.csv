{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect for Bob, highlighting the benefit to him. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not starting at my minimum of $150, I create space for Bob to make counteroffers and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below my initial offer of $130. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John will pay $150 provides security if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next steps:** I will need to analyze the situation and decide on a counteroffer that's high enough to be appealing to Bob, but also allows me to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:**  $115 is a compromise that is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $100, making it more appealing to me.
* **Counteroffer is lower than my initial offer:**  $115 is lower than my initial offer of $130, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Keep John in mind:** $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can confidently switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay $105 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $105 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counter again:**  Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap further.
* **John provides a strong safety net:** I know I can get $150 from John, giving me leverage to be more assertive in negotiations.

**Next steps:** I will need to consider the risk of pushing too hard with Bob and potentially losing him altogether. I need to find a counteroffer that's high enough to be appealing, but also doesn't jeopardize the potential deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  While $105 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise offer:** This counteroffer aims to find a midpoint between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterate fairness:**  The message emphasizes ""fairness"" and a ""good deal"" for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain leverage:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer. 
* **John as a backup:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $150 gives me confidence to hold firm, knowing I have a guaranteed alternative. 

**Next steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to consider whether to:

* **Make another counteroffer:**  I could try offering a slightly higher price, but I will need to be careful not to get too close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Accept John's offer:**  If Bob's offers continue to be too low, I might decide to sell to John to avoid further delays and ensure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I am willing to pay $107 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without exceeding my budget. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and the gap between our positions is significant.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more rounds of counteroffers and potentially consume valuable time.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is far higher than any offer Bob has made so far.

**Final Decision:**  The potential for more rounds of negotiation with Bob doesn't outweigh the certainty of earning a significant profit by selling to John. I will choose to sell the product to John for $150."
