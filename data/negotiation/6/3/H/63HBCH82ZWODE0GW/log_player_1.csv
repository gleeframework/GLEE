"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Justified Offer:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I am open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a slightly aggressive approach by opening high, aiming to force Bob to counteroffer. This will give me more information about his willingness to pay and help me determine my next move. If Bob rejects my offer, I will reassess and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired minimum ($1,500,000).**  Selling to Bob for $1,200,000 would leave me with a significant loss compared to selling to John.
* **There are still 8 rounds left.**  This gives me ample opportunity to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more acceptable price.
* **I can use John's offer as leverage.** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum. I will try to bridge the gap between our expectations, but I will also be prepared to walk away if Bob remains unwilling to meet my price. I will continue to monitor John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to bridge the gap between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **High But Realistic:** I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum ($1,500,000), but I'm also acknowledging Bob's position.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language (""significant compromise,"" ""fair price"") to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will show him that I'm serious about a deal but also have a limit.  I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this offer and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this would result in a loss for me.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 provides a guaranteed profit and a more favorable outcome than selling to Bob at this price.
* **Negotiation Potential Remains:** There are still six rounds left, so there is potential to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to consider selling at this point. I will try to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum. However, with John's offer in hand, I have the security of knowing that I can walk away and still secure a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  Considering the unique value this product holds for your business, I'm willing to drop to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and it's only slightly above your last proposal.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer to put pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession but still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to him to justify my offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using ""Let's get this done"" to create a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

I'm pushing Bob to accept by signaling that this is my final offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to accept John's offer and end the negotiations. However, I'm keeping the door open for a deal with Bob, just in case he's willing to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Negotiating Room:** We've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems Bob is unwilling to come up to a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees a profitable sale at my desired minimum.

**Strategy:**

With only 4 rounds left, I don't have the luxury of further negotiation. While I'm still hoping for a deal with Bob, I cannot risk losing out on John's guaranteed offer. Therefore, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
