"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a steal at this price given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $120.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the first offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let's see if we can come to a deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice in the middle.  He's offering $130, which is a fair compromise between his maximum price ($150) and Alice's minimum price ($120).  This shows good faith and opens the door for a quick resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his initial counteroffer of $130.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more, and there's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer at $135 is a good compromise that saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John."
