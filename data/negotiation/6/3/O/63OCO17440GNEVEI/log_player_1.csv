Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects the offer, but also allows me to potentially earn more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial offer, $7,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a rejection by Bob that forces me to sell to John for a lower profit."
