{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but the difference is still $750. Bob has already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and might feel that further negotiations will take too much time or might not yield a better result.  Buying from John at $8,000 is the most cost-effective and time-efficient option at this point."
