While $725,000 is a significant reduction, it's still worth seeing if Alice will come down a little closer to $700,000. We're still in a good position to negotiate."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can see we're close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while there's room for negotiation, the difference now is relatively small. Accepting at $720,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's $800,000 price."
