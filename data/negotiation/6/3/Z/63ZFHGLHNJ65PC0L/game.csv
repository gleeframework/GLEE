"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, your initial price is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. To make a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the same product from John for that price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
