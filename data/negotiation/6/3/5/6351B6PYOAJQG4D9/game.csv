"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
