"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $120 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer an even lower price if you reject the first offer. You can always buy from John for $150 as a last resort."
