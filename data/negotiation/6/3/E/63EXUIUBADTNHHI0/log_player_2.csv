"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that is still very attractive.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product that will be a major asset to your business. Please consider this offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly less than John's $1,500,000 price. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
