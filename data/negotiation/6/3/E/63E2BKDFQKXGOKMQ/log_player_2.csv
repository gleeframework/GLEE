"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay $8,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still above your maximum. It shows you're serious about buying the product, but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still slightly above your maximum, but it's closer to your target price and likely the best you can get. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but also risks losing the deal altogether, especially since John is offering the product for your maximum price."
