Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the asking price.
* **Time Pressure:** The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quicker.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and ends with a question, indicating Alice is open to discussing the price further.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price. This strategy maximizes her chances of getting the best possible deal."
