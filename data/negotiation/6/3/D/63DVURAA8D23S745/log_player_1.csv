Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can still lower the price slightly and remain above our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
