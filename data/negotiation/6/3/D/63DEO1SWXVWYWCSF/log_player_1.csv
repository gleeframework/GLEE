"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant discount, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal within a reasonable range.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
