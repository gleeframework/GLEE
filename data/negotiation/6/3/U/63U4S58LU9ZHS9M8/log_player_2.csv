"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise that allows Bob to acquire the product at a favorable price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
