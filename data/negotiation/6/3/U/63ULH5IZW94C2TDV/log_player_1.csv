"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
