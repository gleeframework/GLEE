"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. While buying from John is an option, it's best to try and get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer:

* **Shows interest:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Provides a reason for countering:**  It gives a plausible explanation for wanting a lower price without revealing a hard budget limit.
* **Offers a significant but not insulting counter:** It's a substantial decrease from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation.  A price closer to $10,000 would be a good deal. It's worth risking another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $10,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle on $9,750?  That would be a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continues the negotiation:**  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is still engaged and willing to make a deal.
* **Incremental increase:** The offer increases the price, but not all the way to Alice's last offer. This signals willingness to compromise but holds firm on getting a good deal.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason, even a simple one, makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable and less like arbitrary haggling."
