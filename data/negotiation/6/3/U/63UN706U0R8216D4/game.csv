"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $10,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle on $9,750?  That would be a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
