Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your $8,000 minimum, maximizing potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Leaving room for negotiation and ensuring Bob sees a benefit. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob understands the offer and the value proposition.

This approach sets the stage for a negotiation, allowing you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially increase the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, there's room for a better deal.  Bob clearly sees value in the product, and rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $10,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle on $9,750?  That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,750 isn't the ideal price, it's close to your initial $10,500 counteroffer and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's a good compromise that secures a decent profit without risking losing the deal entirely."
