"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount, considering its value to me is much higher. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far below what I can accept.  The product has significant value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value to you, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident it would be a worthwhile purchase.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  Given the product's value to me, I need to be closer to $850,000 to make this deal work.  I believe this price is fair considering the potential value it holds for you.  Let's try to find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
