"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount, considering its value to me is much higher. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far below what I can accept.  The product has significant value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  Given the product's value to me, I need to be closer to $850,000 to make this deal work.  I believe this price is fair considering the potential value it holds for you.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go down to a price that beats John's offer of $800,000 within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
