"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $1,200,000 is still well above your budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. To show you I'm genuinely interested in the product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still offering a price significantly higher than your budget.  You've only got 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to your target price. Buying from John is the best option to ensure you get the product within your budget."
