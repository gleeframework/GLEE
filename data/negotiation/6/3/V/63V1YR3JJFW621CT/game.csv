"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. To show you I'm genuinely interested in the product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
