Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Please let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get the highest price possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This approach balances securing a high price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
