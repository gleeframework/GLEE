"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
