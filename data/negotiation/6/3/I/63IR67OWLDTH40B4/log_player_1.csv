Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, but still keeps Alice well above her minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to aim higher with Bob. 

**The message:**

* Is polite and professional.
* Highlights the product's value to Bob.
* Proposes a price without being overly aggressive.
* Invites Bob's feedback and potential negotiation."
