"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a substantial profit. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair compromise and accepts the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a higher price with more negotiation. We still have several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm making a slight concession, dropping the price to $975,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.  Bob is clearly getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. There's no point in selling now for a price I'm not entirely satisfied with, especially since we still have several rounds left. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit. We are approaching the middle ground between our desired prices, and I believe this will incentivize Bob to accept the offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $920,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price with one more round of negotiation. The risk of selling to John for $800,000 is too high for me at this point, so I'm going to take a chance and see if I can get Bob to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm making one final counteroffer. I'm dropping the price slightly to $940,000, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to choose ""SellToJhon"". I've reached the final round of negotiation with Bob, and we haven't been able to agree on a price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I can't risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, even if it's less than I initially hoped for.  It's better to secure a sale than to risk getting nothing at all."
