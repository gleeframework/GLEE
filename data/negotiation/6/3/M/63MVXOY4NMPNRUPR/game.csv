"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do see the potential value in the product, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only comfortable paying $85. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $95 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement this round.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up on the value of this product just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $90, which would be $92.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm really pushing my limit here, but I can go up to $91.  Let's make this happen!",91.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $91. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $91, which would be $91.75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",91.75,Alice,9,
