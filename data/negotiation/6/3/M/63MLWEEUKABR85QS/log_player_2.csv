"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd prefer to see if we can get closer to my target price of $10,000.  There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a good compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,250. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly in price, but it's still significantly higher than my desired price point.  With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm not confident that we can negotiate down to my budget.  It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will not come down to my price, and I risk losing valuable rounds if I continue to counteroffer. Therefore, it's more prudent to purchase the product from John for $10,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and secure the product."
