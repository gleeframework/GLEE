"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should hopefully encourage Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to potentially get closer to the $150 value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with the offer yet. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $120,  Bob's offer of $105 is getting very close to my target.  It's  a good deal considering I could sell to John for $80. I'm going to accept his offer."
