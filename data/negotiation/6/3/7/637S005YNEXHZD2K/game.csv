"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $715,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",715000.0,Alice,5,
