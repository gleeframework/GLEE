"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind and $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go down to $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is close, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $780,000? This is a firm offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $780,000, which is $802,500. This is my final offer.",802500.0,Alice,7,
