"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $160. How about we settle on $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $100? I'm willing to pay that to get this done today.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have a hard limit at $100.  If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $100, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one last offer: $120. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Alice,7,
