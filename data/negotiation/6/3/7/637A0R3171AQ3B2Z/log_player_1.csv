I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to earn more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $18,000.  This still leaves me room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing too hard."
