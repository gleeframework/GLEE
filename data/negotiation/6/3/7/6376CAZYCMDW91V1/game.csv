"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers both our interests.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your position. How about we settle on $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
