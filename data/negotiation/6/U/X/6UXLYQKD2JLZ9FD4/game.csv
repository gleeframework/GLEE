"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product at a price that reflects its value. I'm starting at $1,750,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I could meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  Would that work for you?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $1,475,000? It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. Your offer is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle at $1,525,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
