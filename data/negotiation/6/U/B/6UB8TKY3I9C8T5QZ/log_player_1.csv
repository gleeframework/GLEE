Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the opportunity and value, creating a positive atmosphere.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly invite Bob to respond, showing I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** See if he's serious about buying.
* **Set the tone for negotiation:** Start the negotiation process with a high price, leaving room for compromise.
* **Maintain my fallback option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $850,000 is still significantly below the $1,000,000 I could get from John. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I signal my commitment to getting a better price and encourage him to increase his offer.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, but still below John's offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below what I could get elsewhere.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation process active and give myself the opportunity to secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profitable margin. 
* **Middle ground:** $875,000 represents a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""mutual benefit,"" aiming to create a sense of win-win.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's limits:** I want to see if he's willing to go higher.
* **Show flexibility:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate that I'm open to compromise.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $875,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
