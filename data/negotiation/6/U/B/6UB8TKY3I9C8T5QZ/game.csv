"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,
