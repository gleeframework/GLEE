"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your budget. You can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting allows you to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget, and it's a good compromise given that she rejected your previous counteroffer. Buying from John for $800,000 would save you $75,000, but there's a risk that you might not be able to secure the product if you reject this offer and Alice changes her mind.  It's a good deal for you, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
