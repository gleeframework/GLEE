Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I think you'll really appreciate it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm also framing it positively to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. Would $90 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge further. While $90 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $100, as it ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids further negotiation."
