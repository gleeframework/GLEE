"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is well below its market value.  I understand it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1300000. This is a significant opportunity for you to secure a valuable asset at a very attractive price.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
