"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's not worth accepting this offer.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is too low.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a more favorable price can be reached.  Bob can counteroffer again, potentially splitting the difference to try and find a compromise."
