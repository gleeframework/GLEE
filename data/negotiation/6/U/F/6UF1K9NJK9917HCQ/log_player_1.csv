Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 helps me set a starting point.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still staying significantly above his perceived value and comfortably below my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperation sell to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob with a price that could be appealing while maximizing my potential profit."
