"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate the value of this product, $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  I'm confident that this is a reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000. This reflects the unique nature of what's on offer. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
