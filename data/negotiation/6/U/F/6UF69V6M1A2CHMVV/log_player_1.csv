Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find a lot of value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is $100, we start with a price above that to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's particularly interested. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes that Bob is getting a priority offer, subtly implying the product might be desirable.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring a sale."
