{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it will be highly valuable to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is 20% higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a chance of a quick sale while still maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, which is the minimum value I'm comfortable with.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to continue negotiations, as I can get the same amount from John."
