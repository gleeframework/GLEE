"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to counter with a price of $950,000 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for this product.  Consider it this way: It's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's compromise at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I would like to counter with a price of $980,000 for the product. This proposal aims to be fair while respecting my budget constraints.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $980,000 is still below the value we both know this product holds.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This price is fair, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
