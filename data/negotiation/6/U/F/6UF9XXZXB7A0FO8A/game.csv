"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you have a price in mind,  $1,075,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still a great deal for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,090,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,085,000?",1085000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1,085,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,095,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
