Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately kills the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for some back and forth without needing to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (which I can achieve with John).
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes a good deal for both parties, fostering a more collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $950,000? This would allow us to both benefit more from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer:** I still have the option to sell to John for a much better price, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door entirely. My counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than his offer, leaving room for further discussion.
* **Finding a middle ground:** The new price of $1,100,000 is a compromise, potentially appealing to Bob while still remaining above my minimum threshold.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to propose a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **No guarantee of a better offer:** While I could potentially negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer. He could even lower it again.
* **Time and risk:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob would take more time and introduce the risk of him ultimately walking away. 
* **Secure deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that is close to my desired price point, and it's a good deal considering my options."
