{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  A price of $120 is a bit above the midpoint between your minimum ($80) and Bob's valuation ($150). This aims to maximize your profit while still being a good deal for Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $120 is a fair deal, Bob might try to negotiate further down. Be prepared to slightly lower your price if needed, but don't go below your $80 minimum.
* **One-Time Offer:** Framing this as a potentially limited-time offer might encourage Bob to act quickly."
