{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14,000? "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to maximize my profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or running out of rounds. John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making it the safer and more cost-effective option."
