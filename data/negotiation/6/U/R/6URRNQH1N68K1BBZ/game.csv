"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its current market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product's inherent potential and the benefits it offers command a higher price point. I can adjust my previous offer slightly, and I'm willing to close the deal at $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident the returns will be substantial.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still a bit far from that number. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my firm limit. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your upper limit, but I believe this product's true value warrants a premium.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $925,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.  ",925000.0,Bob,6,
