{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $10,000, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  You're leaving room for negotiation and making it appealing to Bob.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is straightforward and gives Bob a clear understanding of your offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
