"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Strategic Offer:** This offer allows for potential negotiation while still getting a decent price. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm ready to adjust the price based on Bob's response. If Bob counteroffers, I'll evaluate his offer and make a counter-counteroffer based on his response.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $120, I need to consider the potential lost time and effort if I reject Bob's offer multiple times.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  I'm willing to take a risk by starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but I'll be prepared to reduce the price if necessary to secure a sale.
* **Negotiation Skills:** My success in this scenario will depend on my ability to assess Bob's responses and make strategic counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's counteroffer of $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and a few more rounds of negotiation could lead to a better price.
* **Time Factor:** While I'm aware of the limited rounds, I'm willing to risk a few more rejections to try and reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that John offers a higher price, but I'm committed to maximizing my profit if possible. I'll only consider selling to John if my negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Step:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, keeping in mind Bob's willingness to pay and my desire to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product. While $90 is tempting, I need to cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Value Proposition:** My message focuses on the benefits for Bob, emphasizing that $95 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Strategic Price:** $95 is closer to my minimum of $120, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Building Rapport:** My message is friendly and positive, aimed at maintaining a good relationship with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Reaction:**  I'll carefully observe Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to reassess my strategy and consider the possibility of accepting his offer or selling to John.
* **Time Constraints:** I'm aware that each round brings me closer to the deadline, but I'm confident that a few more rounds of negotiation could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Balancing Profit and Sale:** I'm trying to achieve a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a sale within the limited time frame."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum of $120, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still some room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a slightly higher price.
* **Time Management:** I'm aware of the limited rounds, but I'm willing to risk a few more rejections to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Step:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, keeping in mind his budget constraints and my desire to secure a better price. I'll aim for a compromise that meets both of our needs."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle again at $93? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to sell the product while still making a reasonable profit.  I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:** I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer of $92 and my previous offer of $95. This demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, highlighting that $93 is a good deal for the value he will receive.
* **Strategic Price:** $93 is close to my minimum, but still allows for further negotiation if needed. It's a price point that is likely to be acceptable to Bob, given his previous offers.
* **Maintaining Rapport:**  My message is friendly and positive, aimed at maintaining a good relationship with Bob despite the ongoing negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I need to make sure I can secure a deal quickly.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $91? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $91 is very close to my minimum of $120, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  The price is very low for the value of the product.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there is still a chance to get a better price. We've been going back and forth, and there's likely a compromise we can both agree on.
* **Time Management:** I'm aware of the limited rounds, but I'm willing to risk a few more rejections to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a higher price, I'm committed to maximizing my profit if possible. I'll only consider selling to John if my negotiations with Bob fail.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little further to $92. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our last two offers.

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, reinforcing that $92 is a good price for the benefits he'll receive.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I need to secure a deal quickly to avoid selling to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer of $120, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob before I have to turn to John.
* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this offer. If he rejects it, I'll likely accept his previous offer of $91 to avoid losing the sale.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a lower price, but I believe it's the best strategy to secure a sale within the remaining rounds."
