Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
