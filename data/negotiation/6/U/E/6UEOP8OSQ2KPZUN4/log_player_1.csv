{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives us a starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing you closer to your maximum potential earnings.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While you could start higher, there's a risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. This price point makes it attractive to Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.

By offering the product at $10,000, you aim to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
