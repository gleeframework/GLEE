Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard limit, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining position and keep the possibility of securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $90 is your limit, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain value:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm not losing out.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions and a final price below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed value:** John's offer of $100 is guaranteed and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

While $92 is close to my minimum, I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $100 from John.  It's important to recognize that the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of a lower price and the time investment."
