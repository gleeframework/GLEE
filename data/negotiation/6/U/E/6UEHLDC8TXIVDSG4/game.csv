"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
