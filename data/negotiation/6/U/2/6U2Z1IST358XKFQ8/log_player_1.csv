{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to make at least $12,000, and $14,000 is a good margin.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you a profit.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving the product away, but you're also not being greedy.

You're confident in the value of your product, but you're also willing to negotiate to secure a sale. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still a bit lower than what you're hoping for. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  You've already shown that you're willing to negotiate, but you haven't shown desperation.
* **Push for a better price:**  You're confident the product is worth more than $12,500 to Bob, so you can try to close the gap. 
* **Explore if Bob is willing to go higher:**  He might be willing to increase his offer slightly to secure the deal. 

You'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $14,000. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  This offer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial price.
* **Showing flexibility:**  You're demonstrating a willingness to meet him in the middle, while still being firm on your own value.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  This counteroffer is still above your minimum of $12,000, so you'll still make a profit.

You're hoping that Bob will see the value in your offer and agree to it. But, if he doesn't, you're prepared to negotiate further or sell to John."
