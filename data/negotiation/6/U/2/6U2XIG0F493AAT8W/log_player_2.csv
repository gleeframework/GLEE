"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so there's plenty of time to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, acknowledging that we're far apart.
* **Fair Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to *me* and using my budget as a reason for my price.
* **Room to Negotiate:** I'm leaving room for Alice to counter-offer, hopefully leading to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still too high for me.  While she's moved closer to my initial counteroffer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of finding a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Progress:** I highlight the ""significant jump"" from my previous offer to show I'm actively trying to bridge the gap.
* **Commitment:** I express my desire to reach an agreement, hopefully prompting Alice to reciprocate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, $14,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $14,000. How about we settle on $16,000 and call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still above my budget.  With 5 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating. I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is a significant step forward and demonstrates my genuine desire to close this deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** My offer of $15,000 is getting very close to my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but still have room to negotiate.
* **""Significant Step Forward"":** I emphasize the progress I've made in my offers, hoping to encourage Alice to do the same.
* **Focus on Finalizing:**  I phrase the message to emphasize a desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency."
