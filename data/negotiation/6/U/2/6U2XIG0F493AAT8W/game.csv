"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. This represents a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $14,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $14,000. How about we settle on $16,000 and call it a deal?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is a significant step forward and demonstrates my genuine desire to close this deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.",15000.0,Bob,6,
