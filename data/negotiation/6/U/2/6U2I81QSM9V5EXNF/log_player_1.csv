Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the potential value to Bob, not just the price. This subtly justifies the higher price point.
* **Urgency (Slight):**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies other potential buyers, subtly creating a sense of urgency without being too aggressive.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, aiming too high might make Bob immediately lose interest. This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
