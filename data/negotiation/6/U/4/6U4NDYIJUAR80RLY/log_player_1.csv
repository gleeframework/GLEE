"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but not unreasonable considering its value to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Strong Message:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me, implying that this is a good deal for Bob, even if he has to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,200,000, there's still a substantial margin for negotiation before I reach my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me confidence in holding my ground during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $900,000 is still below my floor of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I have 8 rounds left. I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:**  Knowing John's offer is $1,000,000 gives me the security to keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I've lowered my price by $100,000, showing flexibility. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message emphasizes a ""fair"" price and the benefits of the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if Bob doesn't accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Window Shrinking:** We're getting closer to the middle ground, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price. 
* **John's Offer Provides Security:** With John's offer of $1,000,000, I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob continue to stall. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000 in the next round, keeping in mind that we have only 6 rounds remaining."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my last offer.  It's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's find a way to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  I'm reducing my price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer is now closer to Bob's last offer, indicating a sincere desire to reach an agreement.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  The message emphasizes fairness, a desire to find a solution, and the potential benefits for both parties.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start narrowing the gap between our offers.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal before the time limit expires."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation period, with only 4 rounds remaining. I need to be strategic to ensure I get the best possible deal.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. I can still walk away with $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to reach an agreement without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value I place on this product.  How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to sell the product while still ensuring you get a valuable asset.  Let's close this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  This is my final counteroffer before I'm forced to accept Bob's offer or move to John.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I'm expressing it as a compromise and a solution to ensure we both benefit.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a clear final stand.
* **Positive and Urgent Tone:**  I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal and move forward, hoping to push Bob into accepting my offer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price for your product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $960,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in other similar products.

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. This guarantees me the desired profit without further risk or delay.

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price, selling to John is the most logical and secure option at this stage. It ensures that I get my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of a deal falling through with Bob in the remaining rounds."
