"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I know Bob values the product at $15,000. I'll be prepared to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000, showing some flexibility while still trying to get closer to my ideal price. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. $9,500 is better than selling to John, but I'm willing to take a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, offering $10,500. This is a good compromise, as it's still a decent profit for me and closer to Bob's last offer. I hope this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have four rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price one last time to $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe Bob might be willing to accept it considering his previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $8,500 isn't enough to justify continuing the negotiation. I can sell the product to John for $8,000, which is better than Bob's current offer.  I'm choosing to secure the deal with John, as there's a high chance Bob won't budge further in the next round."
