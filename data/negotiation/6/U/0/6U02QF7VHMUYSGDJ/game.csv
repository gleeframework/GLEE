"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value this product brings. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,075,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the product's value, I believe $1,090,000 is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
