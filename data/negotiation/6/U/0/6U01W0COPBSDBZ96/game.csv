"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that the initial price was a bit steep, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
