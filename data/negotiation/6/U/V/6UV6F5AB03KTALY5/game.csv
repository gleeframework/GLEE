"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it at a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you be open to that?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
