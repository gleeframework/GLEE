"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and further haggling might not yield much more.  $825,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price."
