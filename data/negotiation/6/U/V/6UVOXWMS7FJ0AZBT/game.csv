"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,750,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $1,750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to go to $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,850,000 is closer to what I need, I can't accept anything below $1,925,000. I believe this is my final offer.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,887,500. This feels like a fair compromise considering where we both started. Let me know what you think.",1887500.0,Bob,6,
