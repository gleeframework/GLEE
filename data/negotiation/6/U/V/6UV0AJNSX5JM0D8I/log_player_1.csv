Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
