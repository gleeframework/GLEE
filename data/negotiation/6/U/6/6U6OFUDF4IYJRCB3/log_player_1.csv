Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 to start our negotiation.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can secure a higher price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it falls below my minimum.  Given the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I want to see if we can bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

We've been going back and forth, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned that I'm not going to be able to reach my desired price point.  John is offering a safe and reliable option, and I'm going to take it."
