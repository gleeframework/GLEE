"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 represents a fair starting point given the value this product offers, I understand the need to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. My budget is firm at $1,350,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I'll be bringing to this product. Let's work together to close the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I'm sensing your strong interest in the product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer at $1,500,000. However, I value our conversation and believe we can reach a deal. I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it bridges the gap while respecting the product's true value.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
