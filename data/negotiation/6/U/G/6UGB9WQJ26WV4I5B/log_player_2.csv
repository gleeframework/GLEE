"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While $999,500 is a great price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a slightly lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me for this unique product.  While the price is attractive, I'm looking to secure it for slightly less. Would you be willing to go down to $950,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice has come down to $975,000 which is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely she won't budge much more, and I could end up losing the opportunity to get the product.  $975,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer."
