"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me for this unique product.  While the price is attractive, I'm looking to secure it for slightly less. Would you be willing to go down to $950000? I'm confident this is a fair price that would benefit both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
