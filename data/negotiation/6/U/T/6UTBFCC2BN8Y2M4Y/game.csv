"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
