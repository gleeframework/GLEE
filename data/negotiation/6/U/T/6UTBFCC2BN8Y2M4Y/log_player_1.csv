Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
