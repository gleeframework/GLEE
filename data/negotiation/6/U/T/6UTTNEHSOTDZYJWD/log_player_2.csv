"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would be very useful for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $200, which is much more than its worth to her. This suggests that Alice is trying to overcharge you. You should reject the offer and proceed to the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

While $160 is closer to your maximum, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You are still willing to pay more than John's price, but you can potentially get a better deal with Alice."
