"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price gap between our positions is still quite significant. I've done extensive research and believe this product offers even greater value than you might realize. To move us closer, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, considering my budget and the market value. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
