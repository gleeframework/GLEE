Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It gives him room to counter and allows for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a win-win situation, highlighting the benefit to him and the lower price compared to my other buyer option.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to try to squeeze out some profit, I'm not willing to risk losing a much larger sum.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $800,000, the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. 
* **Message:** I'm  acknowledging Bob's offer but maintaining my stance that it's too low.  I'm offering a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal, though it's not my ideal outcome. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $700000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired value.  I'm not yet willing to settle for that amount, given my other option of selling to John for $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's aim for a compromise - how about $900,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway to make this deal happen.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $900,000,  which is a slight concession from my previous offer of $800,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $700,000.  
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing compromise and a fair deal for both parties. I'm showing flexibility while remaining firm in my desire for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a better deal than Bob's previous offer, though still not my ideal outcome.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer and whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John. This is a critical point in the negotiation, as I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I've already made multiple concessions, and there's a high chance that further negotiations will result in a price that is too low. 

Considering that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, it's wiser to end negotiations with Bob and sell to John. This guarantees me the highest possible profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might lead to a lower price."
