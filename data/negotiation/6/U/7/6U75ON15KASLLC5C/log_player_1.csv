Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is:

* **Above your minimum:** $11,500 is greater than your minimum of $10,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000. 

This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer and allows for room for negotiation without immediately making you lose money."
