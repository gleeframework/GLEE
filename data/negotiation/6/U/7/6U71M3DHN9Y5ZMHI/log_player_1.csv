"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $14,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firmly stuck at $14,000, which is less than my minimum and John's offer. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
