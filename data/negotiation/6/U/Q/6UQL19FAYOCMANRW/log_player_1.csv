Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a significant discount for Bob, making it attractive for him to buy. However, it still leaves me with a healthy profit above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is still above my minimum price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $132, which is only $3 away from my initial offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $140,  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer at $132 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
