"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $110. There's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's price of $110 and my maximum of $120. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my target.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $105.  There's still a chance Alice might come down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is the middle ground between Alice's current offer of $115 and my previous offer of $105.  This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.5 is just slightly above my previous offer of $110 and within my budget of $120. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to $110, but continuing the negotiation might lead to a situation where I end up paying more or buying from John at $120. It's better to accept this offer and get the product at a reasonable price."
