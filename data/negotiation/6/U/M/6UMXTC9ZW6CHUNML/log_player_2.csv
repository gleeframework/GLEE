"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and aim to get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Signal my budget limitations:**  Starting low but not offensively low shows Alice I'm serious but also on a budget.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** Her response will reveal how willing she is to negotiate. If she counters with a price closer to my offer, it indicates room for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Alice has met my alternative price. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as they offer the same price."
