"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll see it's a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we consider $10,500?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest and understanding. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. How about we settle at $12,000? That's a firm offer, reflecting the product's true worth.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down further.  $12,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could possibly do $11,000, but that's really the maximum for my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
