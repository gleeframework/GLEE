"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you. Alice's offer of $95 is too high. It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value for the product, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price. While it is closer to your target, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There are still rounds available, so rejecting the offer allows for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

This counteroffer slightly increases your previous bid, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still remaining below Alice's offer. It also leaves room for a compromise in the following rounds."
