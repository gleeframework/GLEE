Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob. I can see you're serious about this purchase. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.
