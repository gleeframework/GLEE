"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,200. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,200 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $10,750. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference and aim for $10,875.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",10875.0,Bob,6,
