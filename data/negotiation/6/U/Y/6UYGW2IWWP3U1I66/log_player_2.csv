"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **You value the product at $10,000** - This is your maximum price.
* **Alice's offer is $9,500** - This is a better price than John's, but you can likely get an even better deal.
* **You can always buy from John for $10,000** - This is your fallback option, so there's no rush to accept Alice's offer.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for further negotiation and potentially save even more money."
