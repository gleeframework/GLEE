"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to you. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $120. However, I'm only willing to pay $90 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still lower than what John would charge, and it's closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer saves me $25 compared to buying from John.  While I could potentially get a lower price by counteroffering, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer, and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
