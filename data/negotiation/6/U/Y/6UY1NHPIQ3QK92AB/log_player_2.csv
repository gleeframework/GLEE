It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is still a decent price, but we can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

Let's start with a lower offer, but still a good deal for both of us. $850,000 is a significant saving from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

We can still do better than $900,000. Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

Let's split the difference and offer $875,000. This is still a good deal for both of us and hopefully gets Alice closer to accepting."
