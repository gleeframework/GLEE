"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $10,000. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I would like to stay within the original price range. I am willing to consider your offer at $9,500. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to propose another amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,500 is below Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **Significant savings compared to John:**  $9,500 is a substantial saving compared to buying from John for $12,000.
* **Limited negotiating room:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely Bob will get a price much lower than $9,500. There's a risk of Alice rejecting any further counteroffers and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice to get the product within budget and save a significant amount of money."
