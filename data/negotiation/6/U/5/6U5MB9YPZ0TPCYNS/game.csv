"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my asking price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for the product. My counteroffer is $925000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $900000, which is the same as my initial offer. I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",875000.0,Bob,6,
