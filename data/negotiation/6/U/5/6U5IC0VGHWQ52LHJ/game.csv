"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it can be a real game-changer.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its value and potential.  Let's discuss further and find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Considering its value to you and my maximum budget, I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a significant value for your business.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the potential return on your investment. Let's continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs and allows us to make a deal.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,025,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  I hope we can come to an agreement in this round.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
