Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that value."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal with John."
