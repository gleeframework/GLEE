"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, and the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. 
* **Avoiding John:**  John's offer is your fallback option, but it's better to try and get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9250.  That's a great price for a product worth $10000 to you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable:**  It's within your budget and represents a good compromise. You're getting a better price than Alice's initial offer, and she's willing to come down from her initial price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price further. 
* **Saving money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $750 compared to buying from John."
