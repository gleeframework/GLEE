"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think you'll really appreciate the quality and benefits it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than your maximum of $10,000, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
