"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.  Alice's offer is exactly that amount.  While accepting her offer gets you the product, you're not saving any money.  Rejecting her offer lets you go to John, who will also sell you the product for $12,000. This means you have the same outcome (buying the product for $12,000) but with the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
