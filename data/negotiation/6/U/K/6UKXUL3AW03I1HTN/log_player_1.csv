Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $100. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm countering with $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground. If Bob still rejects this, I might consider selling to John for $100, as it's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum value of $100, and I'm willing to accept it rather than risk losing a sale and having to sell to John for $100."
