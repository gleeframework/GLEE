,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay closer to my target.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I hear you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,875?  I'm willing to make a small concession to see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
