"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $170 is still a bit too much for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $135.  How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  It's a fair price and ensures you're getting a great deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
