Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly extraordinary."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though we don't know the specifics of the product.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of desirability and urgency, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer.  How he perceives the product's value and your negotiating stance will influence his decision.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having a negotiation strategy in place will be crucial if you want to get closer to your desired price."
