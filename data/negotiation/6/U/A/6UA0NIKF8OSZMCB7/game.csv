"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,800,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and believe it has great potential. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the product's fair market value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you see its potential. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to revisit this price in future negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your target price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically afford. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget limit. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to your budget limit, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, as it's still below my minimum target price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I need you to commit to this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
