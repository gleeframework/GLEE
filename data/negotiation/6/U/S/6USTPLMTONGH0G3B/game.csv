"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your asking price.  Let's try to find a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
