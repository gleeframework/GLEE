Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $650000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $450000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows room for negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Let's continue this conversation and find a solution that works for both of us.
