"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650000. This is a competitive price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $650,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $450,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows room for negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than what I'd be willing to pay from John. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for compromise. I've included a message explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, setting a positive tone for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450000.

This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also showing my willingness to compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $550,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point.  While I see the value in the product, I believe we can still negotiate a lower price. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $550,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in the product, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue this conversation and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**
