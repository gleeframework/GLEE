Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $2,000 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:** $10,000 is a reasonable price, considering the value to Bob. 

By offering this price, you set a strong starting point and give Bob a reason to consider your offer without immediately jumping to the ""John"" option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way, we both get a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is still below the ideal price, it's a good compromise. You're getting closer to your target and Bob is likely to accept this offer.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, and selling to John will net you less."
