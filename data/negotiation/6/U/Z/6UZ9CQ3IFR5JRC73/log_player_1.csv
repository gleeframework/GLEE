Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might even be higher than the asking price, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion,  avoiding a hardline stance that could immediately scare Bob away.

**Important:** This is a starting point. You can always negotiate downwards with Bob if he initially rejects the offer, aiming for the highest possible price above your $800,000 baseline."
