# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. You can save at least $500 by going with John, but there's a chance you can get it even lower by making a counteroffer."

You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to your ideal price, there's still room for improvement before you have to go with John."
