"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'll counteroffer at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is still a little high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'll make one more concession and counteroffer at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
