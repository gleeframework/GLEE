Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is the most I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential upside, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
