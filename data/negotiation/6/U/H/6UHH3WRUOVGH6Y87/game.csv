"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has significant potential for you as well. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a fair price considering its value and your potential upside.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you think. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is the most I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential upside, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This would still give you a significant return on your investment.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the potential upside, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price reflects the value of the product and offers you a strong opportunity for profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but no higher. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
