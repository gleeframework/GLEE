"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our negotiation, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and it's a significant savings for you compared to the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. Can you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to accept $950,000.  How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This way, we both make a reasonable deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're still pushing for a lower price, but I'm at my limit. I'm willing to go down to $970,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a great opportunity for you. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",970000.0,Alice,7,
