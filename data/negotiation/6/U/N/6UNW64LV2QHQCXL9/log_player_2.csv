"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 10 rounds and can always fall back to John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. He still has 7 rounds left and can always purchase from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you the product for $1,325,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, $1,325,000 is still above his budget. He can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a better deal.  There's still time to push for a lower price, and he can always fall back to John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1310000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,310,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000, which is a compromise that allows us to finalize this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,315,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John at his guaranteed price of $1,200,000. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
