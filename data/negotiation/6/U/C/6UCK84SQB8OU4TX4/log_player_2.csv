"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still within Bob's budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There's still room for Alice to come down, and Bob can continue to counteroffer until a mutually agreeable price is reached or he decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, and it's getting closer to Bob's maximum budget with John. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. If Alice keeps rejecting offers, Bob might end up paying more than his initial budget with John.  It's more secure to buy from John, even though it's not the ideal price, to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
