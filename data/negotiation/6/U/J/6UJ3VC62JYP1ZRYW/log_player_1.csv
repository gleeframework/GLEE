"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob, who values the product at $8,000, to encourage him to counteroffer. This will allow me to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get. I believe there's more room for negotiation, as Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay close to my minimum.  I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,800, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,300 is getting closer to my minimum but is still lower than I'd like. I'm not yet ready to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,600, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer. I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value. I believe this price is fair and will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting frustratingly close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than $12,000.  I've already been negotiating for several rounds, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John at my minimum value. This guarantees me the highest possible profit."
