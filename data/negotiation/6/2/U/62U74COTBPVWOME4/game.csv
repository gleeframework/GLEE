"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13,000? This would still be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your offer, Alice, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $12,800? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits, and I believe it would still provide you with a reasonable profit.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession.  How about $13,200? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  If you're still interested in the product, I think we can find a solution here. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose $13,000 as a compromise. This would enable me to acquire the product without straining my budget, while also ensuring you receive a fair return for your efforts. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.",13000.0,Bob,6,
