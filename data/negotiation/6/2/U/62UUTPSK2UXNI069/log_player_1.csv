{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, while also trying to get closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really close to just selling to John, but I'd prefer to do business with you. I'm willing to go down to $112.  This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm trying to close the deal with Bob. I'm giving him a final offer that's only slightly higher than his last offer. This gives me a good chance of selling to Bob while still maximizing my profits."
