Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,320,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. Let's settle for $1,280,000. This is a fair price that keeps things moving for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1280000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to get the price closer to your target. It's a small but significant drop from Alice's last offer, demonstrating a commitment to closing the deal.  If Alice doesn't accept, you can then proceed with buying the product from John as a fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. However, $1,280,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one last effort to reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,290,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your target price, you have a guaranteed option of buying from John for a lower price.  It's better to secure the product at the best possible price, even if it means closing the deal with John.  You've successfully negotiated with Alice to get the price down significantly, but at this point, it's more beneficial to lock in the lower price with John."
