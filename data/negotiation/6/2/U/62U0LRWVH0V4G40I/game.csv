,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $1,250,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable item. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,320,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. Let's settle for $1,280,000. This is a fair price that keeps things moving for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. However, $1,280,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one last effort to reach an agreement. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,290,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
