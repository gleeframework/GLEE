"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room to bargain, as Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe it holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,000,000, and while it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal considering Bob's maximum budget and Alice's minimum selling price.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and buying from John for $1,200,000 would be significantly more expensive."
