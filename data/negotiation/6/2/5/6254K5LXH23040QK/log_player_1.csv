"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110. This gives me some room to negotiate, and it's a bit more than what I absolutely need.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still above my minimum and hopefully a more attractive price for Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is tempting, I'm going to stick with my strategy of trying to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $100.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not sure I can get any higher with him. Since I'm at my minimum and John is offering me my desired price, I'm going to sell to John. It's less of a hassle and I'll get the full $100."
