{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to give in that quickly. I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to what Bob is willing to pay, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will continue to negotiate to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $92, which is still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $92, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $92, which would be $86. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better price. I am confident that I can reach a higher price with Bob. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'll stick with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $86 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. It's the best I can do, and I really want to buy this product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's not quite there yet.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
