"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that's truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a steal considering its rarity and potential. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for my budget. Given my research and the value I see, I'm willing to offer $750000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this unique item. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $750000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $825000 is still a bit outside my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
