Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer attempts to maximize my profit while still considering the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Minimum acceptable price:** I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so anything above that is a win for me.
* **Maximizing profit:** I want to maximize the price I get, so offering a higher price is desirable. 
* **Risk assessment:** By offering $1,500,000, I am taking a calculated risk. If Bob values the product at less than this, he'll reject the offer, but I'm still guaranteed a sale to John for $1,000,000.

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.  However, without any information on Bob's potential value for the product, it's a gamble."
