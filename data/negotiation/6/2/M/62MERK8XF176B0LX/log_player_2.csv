"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  It makes sense to try and get a better deal from Alice or go with John."
