"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about $750,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and allows me to stay within my limits.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.
