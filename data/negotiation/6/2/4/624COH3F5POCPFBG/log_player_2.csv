"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and exceptional quality, I understand its worth to you stands at $12,000. My proposal is to offer it to you at $11,000, aiming to create a mutually beneficial transaction. I trust this price reflects a fair compromise while allowing us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.** This is still above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* **John's offer is $12,000.** While this is your maximum, it's still a better deal than Alice's offer. 

You want to save as much money as possible, and rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John and save $1,000."
