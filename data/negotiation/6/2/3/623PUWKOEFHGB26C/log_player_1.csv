Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $9,500. This is a compromise that meets him halfway, but still allows me to earn more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and it's better than selling to John for $12,000. It's also unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
