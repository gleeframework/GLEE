"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **It's too early to accept:** There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so accepting at $150 might be a bad deal.
* **John's offer is a baseline:** Knowing John will sell for $150 gives us a clear limit. 
* **Counteroffer is a good next step:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows us to start the negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A significant counteroffer (40% off) shows our willingness to negotiate and puts pressure on Alice.
* **Leaving room:**  We have a $50 buffer before reaching John's price, allowing for some negotiation back and forth.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial counteroffer will give us a sense of how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:** She's come down from $150 to $110, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **We can still do better:** We still have a $40 margin before reaching John's price, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffering keeps pressure:** A counteroffer maintains our position and could potentially push Alice closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  We're moving closer to Alice's offer, showing good faith while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Small increments:** A small increase from our previous offer demonstrates our willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's commitment to the deal and see if she's willing to meet us halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is stubborn:** She's sticking to a price close to her initial offer, indicating a potential unwillingness to budge further.
* **Reaching a reasonable point:**  $115 is a fair price, considering our original goal of $100 and John's $150 price.
* **Time is running out:**  We've already used 4 rounds, leaving only 6 rounds to reach a deal. Accepting now minimizes the risk of failing to find a deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
