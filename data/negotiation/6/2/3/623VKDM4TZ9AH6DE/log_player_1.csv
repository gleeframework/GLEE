{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, and we value it at a minimum of $1,500,000.  A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but starts at a point significantly above Bob's valuation while remaining below our guaranteed sale price.
* **Exclusivity:**  By phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the ""fair deal,"" we create a sense of value and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. We might need to adjust our offer based on Bob's response and negotiation skills."
