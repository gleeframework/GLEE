"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I briefly mention the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept. While this is tempting, I have 9 more rounds and want to see if I can get more.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if I demonstrate a willingness to walk away.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John now guarantees me $15,000 but might cost me the chance to earn more.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's, perhaps around $17,000, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,500. This price reflects the unique value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a negotiation advantage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value, hoping to justify the price.
* **Middle Ground:** The $17,500 offer is a middle ground, suggesting a willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Price:**  Bob has increased his offer, showing he's interested. However, it's still below my desired price.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get closer to $17,500 in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiations and potentially squeeze out a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counter-offer that's slightly higher than Bob's $16,000, but lower than my previous offer of $17,500.  I might offer $16,500 to keep the momentum going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($17,500) and Bob's offer ($16,000). This shows I'm actively trying to reach a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's value and the time spent negotiating to justify the price. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  By mentioning the time spent discussing, I subtly imply that we're nearing the end of negotiations, adding a bit of pressure.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $16250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $16,250 is very close to my target price. However, I'm still a bit away from maximizing my profit.
* **Time Advantage:**  With four rounds left, I still have time to try to nudge Bob up a bit further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale, but I'm hoping to gain an additional $1,250 by continuing.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $16,350. I'll emphasize that this is my final offer and that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence in negotiating. I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to come down just a little more to $16,350. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. What's your decision?"", ""product_price"": 16350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm establishing a clear deadline and leaving no room for further negotiation. This adds pressure and urgency to the situation.
* **Slight Increase:**  My offer is slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but I'm emphasizing that it's my final offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I have limits.
* **Threat of Selling:** I'm explicitly mentioning the alternative of selling to John. This serves as a reminder of the opportunity cost of rejecting my offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll have to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the potential for a higher price. With only three rounds remaining, I'm considering the possibility of selling to John for a guaranteed $15,000 if I believe there's no chance of getting a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, the chance of a better offer from Bob is slim.
* **No Significant Increase:** Bob's offer is only $350 higher than his previous offer, indicating he's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, while risking further negotiation could lead to a deal falling through.

**Next Steps:**

Since I'm accepting Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. I will proceed to finalize the sale and secure the $16,000."
