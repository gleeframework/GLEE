Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You're still above your desired price point. You can try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $107. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You've already negotiated a decent price, but it's still not worth it to you to go any further. You can get the product from John for $100, which is your limit."
