"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given your product's value to you is lower, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This reflects a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
