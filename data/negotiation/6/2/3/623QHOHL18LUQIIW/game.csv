"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $850,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $800,000. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I think we can do better than that. How about we aim for $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with.",950000.0,Alice,5,
