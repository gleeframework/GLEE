{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $9,500 is above your budget, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $8,750. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am still willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  It's more likely that we'll be unable to reach an agreement with Alice. Since I have a guaranteed deal from John, it's best to take that option now."
