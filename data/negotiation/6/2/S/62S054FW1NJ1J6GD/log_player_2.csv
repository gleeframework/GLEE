# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10500. I know it's worth at least that much to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you first. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
