"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the price John is offering. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
