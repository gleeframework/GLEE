Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a lower price than my initial offer, showing some willingness to compromise."

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate further.  While selling to John would be a guaranteed profit, I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob."
