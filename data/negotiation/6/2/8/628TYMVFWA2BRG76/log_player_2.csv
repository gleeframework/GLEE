I'm starting with a low offer of $500,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility given my $800,000 budget. I'll see how she reacts to this offer."

I'm raising my offer to $700,000. This is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but it's closer to my maximum budget and hopefully shows I'm serious about buying the product."
