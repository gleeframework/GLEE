"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still a significant amount."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to maximize my savings. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and the offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  While it's still above your initial counteroffer, it's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to get the product while still saving a substantial amount."
