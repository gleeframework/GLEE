Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,250. This is my final compromise, considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is suggesting this is her final compromise, we still have rounds to negotiate and are closer to our ideal price than John's offer. By continuing to counter-offer, we might be able to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,250 is closer, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Would you be open to $8,750? I think that's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference again, showing Alice we are willing to move towards her price but also indicating we're serious about getting a reasonable deal. This keeps the negotiation moving without accepting a price too close to John's backup offer."

Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,125. This is my final compromise, considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is sticking to her pattern of halving the difference, but we're now getting close to a point where further negotiation might not yield significant savings. We'll push one more time, but be prepared to accept her next offer if it's around $9,062.50 or less."

""product_price"": 8937.50
}
```
