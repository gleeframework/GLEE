"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  While I appreciate your offer, the $1,100,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product represents value to you, and I am truly interested in finding a fair deal.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? I believe this price reflects a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
