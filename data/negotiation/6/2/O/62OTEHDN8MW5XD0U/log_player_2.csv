# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth that much to you.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Since Alice is offering the product at the exact price it's worth to Bob, there's no benefit in accepting her offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with John, or find another seller altogether."
