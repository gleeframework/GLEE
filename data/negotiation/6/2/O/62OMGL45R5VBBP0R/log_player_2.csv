"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a profitable deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's less than John's price of $1,000,000, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
