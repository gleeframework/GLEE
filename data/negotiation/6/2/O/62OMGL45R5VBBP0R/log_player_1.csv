Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $800,000 and leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob, but still allows for a good profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a profitable deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  Rejecting this offer will allow you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
