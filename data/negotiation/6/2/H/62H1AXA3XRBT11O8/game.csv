"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $2000000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800000 is simply too low.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it's worth a lot more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1400000?  I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I can't go higher than $1000000. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1000000 is definitely a step in the right direction, but it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference at $1200000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for your product.  While I value it, I'm still capped at $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider this final offer?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
