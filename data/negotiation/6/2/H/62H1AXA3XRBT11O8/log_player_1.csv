Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is something, it's far too low for what this product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is simply too low.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it's worth a lot more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I can't go higher than $1000000. Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still too low.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that's fair to both of us if we keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,000,000 is definitely a step in the right direction, but it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference at $1,200,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for your product.  While I value it, I'm still capped at $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider this final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to accept that price. It's better to secure a sale with John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with nothing."
