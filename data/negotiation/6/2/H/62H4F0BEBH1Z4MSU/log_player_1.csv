Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $11,000? I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my target price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,250? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $10,750? I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to get this deal done, but I need to make sure it's still within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  We're close, but I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with one more push.  I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price for the value you place on the product, and it's the final offer I can make.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original offer of $10,000. How about we settle at $10,500? This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum.  However, I'm still not comfortable with his final price. I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate, we might not reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John.  I'm going to accept John's offer of $12,000."
