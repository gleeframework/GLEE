"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives me a good starting point, and it's still within the range of what Bob is likely to pay. If he rejects, I can then adjust based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and get something, my goal is to maximize my profit.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still a good profit for me. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a little low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm also considering John's offer at this point, so I may choose to sell to him in the next round if Bob doesn't come up to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $12,200. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to what I want. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I might seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time. It's getting risky to keep rejecting, as John's offer is a sure thing. I'm going to take the $12,000 from John and end the negotiation with Bob."
