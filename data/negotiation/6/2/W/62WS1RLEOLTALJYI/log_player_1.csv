Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a little high for me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly below what John is offering. We need to nudge Bob closer to our acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  the value of this product is substantial, and $750,000 doesn't reflect that. I could consider $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end."",

We're getting very close to John's offer, but we can still try to push Bob a little further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is very close to what I had in mind.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a very similar price point. To avoid losing out to the other buyer,  would you consider $810,000?"",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the position you're in. I'm willing to move a bit to $790,000.  Let me know if that works. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000

It's time to cut our losses. Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer at this point, and we risk losing both buyers if we continue to push him. Selling to John guarantees the $800,000 and avoids the risk of ending up with no deal at all."
