,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This gives us both a fair deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13,250 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $13,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference between our last offers and go with $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,750. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to go below $13,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm confident you'll be happy with it at that price.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're confident in the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer, so how about $12,625?",12625.0,Bob,8,
