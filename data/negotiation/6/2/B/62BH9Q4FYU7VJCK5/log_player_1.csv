Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating you're open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  If Bob rejects $10,000 outright, it suggests he's not seriously interested.
* **Start the Bargaining Process:**  A counteroffer from Bob gives you valuable information about his perceived value of the product. 
* **Maintain Option to Sell to John:**  Knowing you have a fallback option at $8,000 provides leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $8500?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, but that's the most I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can do better. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob's message shows he's genuinely interested and willing to negotiate, suggesting further room for improvement.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to maximize my profit and see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than $8,500, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $8,500 is tempting, I need to be a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  $9,000 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate, while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value, justifying the higher price point.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with $9,000, I aim to:

* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  The counteroffer is higher than his offer, reminding Bob that I have options.
* **Keep Negotiations Moving:**  A higher counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob and encourages him to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8750.  That's really my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is only $750 below my minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Trying to negotiate further risks losing Bob altogether and having to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision. It secures a sale close to my minimum price, minimizes risk, and avoids further negotiation."
