"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $650,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $575,000 for the product. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $575,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $530,000?",530000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $570,000. This is already a compromise for me, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",570000.0,Alice,5,
