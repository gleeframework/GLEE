"Alice, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $1,225,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
