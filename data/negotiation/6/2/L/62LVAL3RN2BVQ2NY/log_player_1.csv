"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. It's worth risking a few more rounds to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a chance to secure a beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's finalize the deal at this price.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's also the exact value of the product to him.  Accepting this offer means I'm getting the best possible deal from Bob, and it's still a good profit for me.  While I could potentially get more from John, there's no guarantee he'll still be interested in the product after these negotiations."
