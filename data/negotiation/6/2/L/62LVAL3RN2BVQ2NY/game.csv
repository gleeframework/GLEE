"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1100000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $950000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a chance to secure a beneficial deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's finalize the deal at this price.  ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
