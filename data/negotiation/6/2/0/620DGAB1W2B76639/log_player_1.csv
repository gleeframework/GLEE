Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and gives you a healthy profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.
