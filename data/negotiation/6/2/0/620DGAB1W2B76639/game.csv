"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a great starting point and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and gives you a healthy profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's still a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. I'm confident this product is worth the investment, and I'm eager to move forward. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to making this deal happen, but I can't justify going above $1,125,000 at this point. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this now.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to making a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
