Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be valuable to you, and I'm offering it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Since Bob values the product at $80, offering it slightly below John's buying price gives us a chance to maximize our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's particularly interested. This strategy avoids anchoring too low initially.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  By mentioning you have another buyer, it subtly implies that Bob needs to act reasonably quickly if he wants the product."
