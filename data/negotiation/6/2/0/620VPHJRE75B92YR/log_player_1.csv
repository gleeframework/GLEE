Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You can aim slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he'll bite.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and the high demand, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $875,000 is above Bob's valuation, but not exorbitantly so. It leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to slightly lower your price, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **John as Leverage:** You don't need to explicitly mention John, but having him as a backup gives you a strong negotiating position."
