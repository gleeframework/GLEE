Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

It's getting frustrating. Bob seems stuck on $1,250,000.  I'm not willing to risk more rounds and potentially go even lower. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's a guaranteed sale, and it's the best deal I can get at this point."
