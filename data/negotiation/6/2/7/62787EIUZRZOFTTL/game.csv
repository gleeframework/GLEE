"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $1,150,000. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good opportunity to acquire it. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
