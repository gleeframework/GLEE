Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $100 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, hoping to find a compromise."
