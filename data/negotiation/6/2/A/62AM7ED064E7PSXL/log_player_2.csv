"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a low counteroffer ($60) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing our budget limitations. This helps maintain a positive tone during negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $90 is still more than we want to spend. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, so there's a chance we can get the price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $70?  I think that's a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We increased our offer to $70, showing Alice that we are willing to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her current offer ($90) and our previous counteroffer ($60). 
* **Direct and Clear:**  We state a specific price we're willing to pay, encouraging Alice to do the same."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $85. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not Quite:**  Alice is getting very close to our limit. However, $85 is still $5 more than John's offer.
* **Final Push:** We'll use the remaining rounds to see if we can push Alice down just a bit further. 
* **Backup Plan:** We always have John as a backup option if Alice won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80.  Would you be willing to match that price?  If so, we have a deal."",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** We're letting Alice know we have other options without being confrontational. This adds pressure for her to lower the price.
* **Final Offer:**  We're stating that $80 is our absolute limit. This makes it clear that we're serious and not going to budge further.
* **Call to Action:** We end by explicitly saying ""we have a deal"" if she accepts, aiming for a quick resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'm not willing to match that price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and my original offer of $90, which would be $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice seems stuck at $85 and is unlikely to budge.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the last few rounds, and continuing the negotiation might not yield better results. 
* **John's Offer:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $80, which is our target price. It's better to take the guaranteed deal than risk Alice not budging further and missing out."
