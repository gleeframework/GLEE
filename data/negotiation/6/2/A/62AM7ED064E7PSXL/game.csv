"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $70?  I think that's a fair price.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $85. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $80.  Would you be willing to match that price?  If so, we have a deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'm not willing to match that price just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and my original offer of $90, which would be $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,7,
