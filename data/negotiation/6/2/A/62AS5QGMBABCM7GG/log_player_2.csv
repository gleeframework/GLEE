"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $9,500. I think it would be a valuable addition to your inventory, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price, especially since we have ample rounds and the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest while also being firm about our budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential compromise somewhere between $7,000 and Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $8,500? I'm confident it's worth that to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. Her offer is closer to her value ($8,000) than ours ($10,000 max).  Let's see if we can get her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $8,000. This offer aims directly at her bottom line.
* **Sense of Fairness:** By proposing a ""meeting in the middle,"" we create a sense of compromise and fairness, which can be persuasive. 
* **Time Constraint:** While we have rounds left, proposing a price close to Alice's value now increases the chances of a quick and favorable resolution."
