"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for my ideal price.  I know Bob values it less, but I'm confident we can negotiate. This also gives me room to maneuver if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below what I need. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a better price. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still too low.  I'm not confident I can get him to budge much further, and I'm risking losing a better deal with John. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
