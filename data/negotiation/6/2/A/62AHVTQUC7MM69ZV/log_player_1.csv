Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming high initially allows me to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he wishes. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly rather than risk losing the deal.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still fall back on selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
