"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
