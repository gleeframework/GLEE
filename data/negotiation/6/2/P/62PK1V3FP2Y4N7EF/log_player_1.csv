Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and showing that I'm interested in a deal, but also setting a clear price expectation.

This approach allows for a potential negotiation but also protects my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's a good deal for both of us. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price for me, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away.  It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing it entirely."
