"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than the asking price in the long run.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?
