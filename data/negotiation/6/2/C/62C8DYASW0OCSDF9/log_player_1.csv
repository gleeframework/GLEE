Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm leaving room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is almost my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it for now. I'd rather try to squeeze a bit more out of him.  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,500,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a decent profit.  This price is a compromise, hopefully making it more appealing to Bob while still being significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I've already spent a few rounds trying to get a better price, and John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's time to take the secure deal and move on."
