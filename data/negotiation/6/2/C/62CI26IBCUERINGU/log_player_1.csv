Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is still a good price for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price than his offer of $105. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, but I'm going to accept it. I've already rejected his previous offer and made a counteroffer, so I'm concerned that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob. Selling to John for $100 is an option, but getting $105 is better, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
