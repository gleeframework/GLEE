"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
