,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $180?  That's a significant reduction on my part to try and meet you closer to your budget.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $150. Can you consider that?",150.0,Bob,4,
