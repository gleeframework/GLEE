{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counters, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
