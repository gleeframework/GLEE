"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The goal is to save money.**  $130 is still above the product's worth to you ($150).
* **There are more rounds to negotiate.**  You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a lower price, but not too low:** $115 is still above the product's worth to Alice ($100), so it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Be polite but firm:** It's important to be respectful while also clearly stating your offer. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This counteroffer provides some room for compromise in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your target:** $122 is still more than you're willing to pay. 
* **More rounds available:** You still have time to try and negotiate a lower price.  
* **Possibility of a better deal:** It's possible Alice might come down further in price.  

You can try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your desired $115."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $122 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $118.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This counteroffer moves the price up slightly from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** The message highlights that this price is fair to both parties, making it more likely Alice will consider it.
* **Leaves Room for Agreement:** It's possible Alice might be willing to meet you at $118, or you could further negotiate from this point."
