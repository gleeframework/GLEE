"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11500.0,Alice,7,
