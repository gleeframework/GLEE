Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to be ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** A high starting price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then gradually decrease your asking price, aiming for the highest possible amount above your minimum.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" of the product in your message helps justify the high price tag.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time to negotiate with Bob before you need to finalize the sale with John."
