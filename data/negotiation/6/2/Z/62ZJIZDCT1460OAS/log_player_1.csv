Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but going lower than $119 would be unnecessary.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below $120 might entice him while still providing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 provides a safety net. There's no need to drastically lower the price for Bob."
