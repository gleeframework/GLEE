{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate. I believe the product is worth at least $100 to me, so I'm not willing to go lower than that. If Bob rejects, we can continue to negotiate, and if necessary, I can always fall back on selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  Would you be willing to go down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $100. While I'd like to sell to Bob, his offer isn't good enough for me. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great price for this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum value, but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $100?  I'm serious about buying this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value for the product, and he seems serious about buying. There's no point in rejecting his offer and risking further negotiation, especially since I can sell to John for the same price."
