After careful consideration, I would like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This price takes into account your valuation and budgetary constraints while still reflecting the product's value and my desire to make a sale. I am confident that this offer will be more acceptable to you and bring us closer to reaching an agreement.
