"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** While it's below your maximum, it leaves a significant profit margin for Alice. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have room to negotiate a lower price and still get a good deal. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** It's good to have a fallback, but you want to try and save money if possible. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable.** It's a significant drop from her initial price and puts us closer to a win-win situation.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not guaranteed.** There's a risk Alice might not budge further, and you could end up buying from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor.** The longer you negotiate, the more time you risk losing, potentially losing the product to another buyer.

Accepting the offer at $950,000 is a good compromise that allows you to save $250,000 compared to buying from John."
