"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's a negotiation tactic to start with a significantly lower offer than my target price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a price below $11,000.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps foster a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice met me halfway, which is a good sign that we can find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still have room to negotiate before reaching my $12,000 walk-away point. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to inch closer to a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working for me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference Again:** This counteroffer proposes splitting the difference between her last offer ($10,500) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000).  It shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards my target.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product while highlighting that this price point works for me. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a small buffer between this offer and my $12,000 walk-away point if Alice counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll move much further. Accepting $10,800 is a good deal â€“ it saves me $1,200 compared to buying from John and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down."
