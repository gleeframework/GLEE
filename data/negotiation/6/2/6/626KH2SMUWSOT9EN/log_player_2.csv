Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate further. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and you have 9 more rounds to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a significant counteroffer, but it's within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It's a strong starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if they'll budge further. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob time to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that Bob is willing to meet halfway, while still pushing for a lower price. The goal is to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties, increasing the likelihood of closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  While there's a possibility of further negotiation, it's not a huge difference in price and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether. There are still 5 rounds left, so even if Bob doesn't get the absolute lowest price, he's still in a good position."
