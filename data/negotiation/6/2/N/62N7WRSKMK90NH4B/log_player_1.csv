Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. It's higher than my minimum, but I think it's a fair starting point. Since Bob values the product at $120, there's room for negotiation.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum of $120. It's a good deal for me, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round. I'd rather lock in the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
