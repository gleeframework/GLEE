Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to accept a lower counteroffer if necessary, while still achieving a profit.
* **It's a strong starting point:** By offering a concrete price, you show Bob that you're serious about selling and encourage him to counter-offer. 

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response and your assessment of his willingness to pay. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really want to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if I can push Bob further.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This price allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $920,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$920,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and a lot closer to my minimum than John's offer.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge any further.  Accepting his offer is the most reasonable choice at this point."
