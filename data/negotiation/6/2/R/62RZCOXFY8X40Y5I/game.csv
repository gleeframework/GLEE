"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
