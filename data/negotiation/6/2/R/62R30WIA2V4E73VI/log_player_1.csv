Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its quality and potential."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price well above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone higher. If he counters, it starts the negotiation process.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value ($10,000), it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).  I'll counter-offer in hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $17,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end."", ""product_price"": 17000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance on value.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** It's crucial to stay above the $15,000 I can get from John. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer will reveal more about how badly Bob wants the product. If he's unwilling to go above $12,000, it's likely time to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Bob is unlikely to go higher than $14,000. This is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price. 
* **No Point in Further Negotiation:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a favorable outcome. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
