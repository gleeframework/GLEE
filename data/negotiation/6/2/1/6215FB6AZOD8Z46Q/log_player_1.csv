{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still gives me a good profit margin. It leaves room for negotiation, but also shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a good price, it's a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That way, I can get a good deal, and you can still make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there. Let's compromise at $112.50.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I can make this work."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $112.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $112.50. How about $108.75? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going nowhere. I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, and it seems like Bob is not willing to go any higher. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
