Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd like to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from where I see the value. This product is truly unique and offers immense potential beyond the price you've proposed.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your perspective on the value, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, the offers are increasing at a slow rate.  It's unlikely we'll reach a deal that significantly exceeds John's offer before running out of rounds. Accepting John's offer for $1,000,000 guarantees the best outcome in this scenario."
