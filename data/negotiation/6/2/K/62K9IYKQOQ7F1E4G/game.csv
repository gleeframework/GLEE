"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could we do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  To avoid dragging this out, I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",8750.0,Alice,5,
