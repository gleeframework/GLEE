"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are still 9 rounds left, so rejecting the offer gives Bob more room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to compromise. He's aiming to bridge the gap between his ideal price and Alice's offer. He's also expressing his willingness to negotiate, keeping the door open for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:**  $10,500 is only $500 above Bob's ideal of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rejections and potentially a higher price if Alice becomes more firm. 
* **Time constraint:** There are still 7 rounds remaining, but it's better to secure a good deal than risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
