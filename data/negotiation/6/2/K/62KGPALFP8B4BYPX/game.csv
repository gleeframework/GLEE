"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a significant profit for you and a good deal for me. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
