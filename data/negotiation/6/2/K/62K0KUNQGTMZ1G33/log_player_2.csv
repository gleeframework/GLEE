"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate with Alice further or buy from John as a backup option."
