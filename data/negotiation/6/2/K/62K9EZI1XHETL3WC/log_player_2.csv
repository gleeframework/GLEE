Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $120.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable selling for $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a compromise from my initial price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, she's still above his budget.  Since John offers the product for $120, Bob should go with John. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as the savings are minimal."
