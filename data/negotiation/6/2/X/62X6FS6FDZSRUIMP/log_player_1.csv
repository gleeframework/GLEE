{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's a little more than Bob's valuation of $80, but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also leaves me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to reach a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $90. It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
