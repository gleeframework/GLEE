"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it. This is a significant price reduction, but it's the maximum I can afford at this time.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1200000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $900000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1050000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting closer.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize the deal. Let's find a way to come to an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
