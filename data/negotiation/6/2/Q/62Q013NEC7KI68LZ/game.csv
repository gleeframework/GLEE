"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems great, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,040,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1040000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,040,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $1,055,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for both of us. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1055000.0,Alice,7,
