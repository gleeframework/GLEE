Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to part with it at this price if you act quickly."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for the potential to earn a bit more. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""if you act quickly"" adds a touch of urgency that might sway Bob. 
* **High but Reasonable:** $14,999 is a significant amount, making the offer seem more serious and the product more valuable. While it's unlikely Bob will accept, it leaves room for potential negotiation if he's interested but wants a lower price.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit. If the goal were to simply secure a sale as quickly as possible, offering the product at $15,000 to Bob would be the safest approach."
