"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good value for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To be frank, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above what I can afford. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
