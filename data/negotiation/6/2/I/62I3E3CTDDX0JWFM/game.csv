"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $975,000.  This offer represents a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000?  That would work much better for my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me. I could potentially make $800,000 work, but that's absolutely the highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
