"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a lower price and not settle immediately.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower counteroffer. This tactic accomplishes a few things:

* **Establishes a Range:**  It immediately signals to Alice that we're looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Gauges Alice's Flexibility:** Her reaction to this counteroffer will give us insight into how much she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Even if this offer is too low, there are rounds left to gradually increase our offer and find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $975,000.  This offer represents a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly above our target. We've successfully moved her down from her initial offer, so there's room for further negotiation. We'll continue to counteroffer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000?  That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Gradual Increase:** We're making a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling to Alice that we're serious about finding a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is below our maximum but leaves room for us to negotiate up slightly if needed.
* **Open Communication:**  We're continuing to express our interest while clearly stating our budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but we're not there yet. Her offer of $850,000 is still above our absolute limit, and we have enough rounds left to potentially negotiate a better deal. It's worth seeing if we can get her closer to $800,000.  We'll counteroffer strategically in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me. I could potentially make $800,000 work, but that's absolutely the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at the point where we should reveal our absolute maximum price to Alice.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is our final offer, we're hoping to motivate her to accept rather than risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice knows we have the option to walk away and buy from John for $800,000. This puts some pressure on her to accept our offer."
