Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $975,000.  This offer represents a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $725,000?  That would work much better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we are still far from our minimum acceptable price. We need to show him we are willing to negotiate but also stand firm on a reasonable valuation.  It's too early to settle for $725,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me. I could potentially make $800,000 work, but that's absolutely the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum price, which is also the highest price he'd be willing to pay. It's unlikely he'll go higher. While it's not ideal, accepting his offer at $800,000 avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures a significant profit over selling to John for $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price)."
