"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you and our costs, let's aim for a fair price. How about we start at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground that respects both our interests. Given the quality of the product and its value to you, I propose a price of $8,200. This still allows us to cover our costs while being more accessible to your budget.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,200 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and your previous offer, I think $7,800 strikes a good balance. It's slightly above your last proposal but still below my initial offer. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
