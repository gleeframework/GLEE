Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the potential it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than you do or is willing to pay a premium for exclusivity.  
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
