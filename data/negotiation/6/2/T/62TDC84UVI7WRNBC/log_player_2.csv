Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget limitations. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept the offer. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while you could try to push for $109, it's risking losing the deal entirely.  Getting the product for $110 is a good compromise and meets your goal of saving money."
