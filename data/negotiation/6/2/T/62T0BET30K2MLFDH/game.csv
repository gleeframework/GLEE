"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your generosity. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your target price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept your price just yet. I'll need to make a counteroffer to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'll sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While I appreciate the lower price, I'm still a bit above my target. To make this work, I'd need to come in at $1,100,000. This price would still give you a healthy profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not ready to go all the way down to $1,100,000. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
