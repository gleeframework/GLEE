"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still quite a bit above your ideal price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.**  Knowing you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage in your negotiations with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your generosity. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your target price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start strong:**  A significant counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept your price just yet. I'll need to make a counteroffer to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'll sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,150,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **More negotiation needed:** You have more rounds available, and there's still room to get closer to your target price. 
* **John remains your backup:** Knowing you can buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you confidence to push for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While I appreciate the lower price, I'm still a bit above my target. To make this work, I'd need to come in at $1,100,000. This price would still give you a healthy profit while allowing me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but steady progress:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about getting a deal, but it's a smaller step than your previous offer.

* **Highlight the value for Alice:**  You're emphasizing the financial benefits of accepting your offer, encouraging her to compromise."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not ready to go all the way down to $1,100,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $1,110,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to get a good value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```

* **Close to your target:** While Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is still above your ideal price, it's very close. 
* **Limited rounds left:**  You only have 3 rounds remaining, so pushing for a lower price might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you a safety net. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's."
