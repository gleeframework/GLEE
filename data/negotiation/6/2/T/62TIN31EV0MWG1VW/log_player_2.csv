"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is really my bottom line.  Perhaps we could meet in the middle at $18,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price. There's room for further negotiation. Buying from John now would be a loss, as Bob can potentially secure a lower price through further negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $16,500?  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $17,500.  This offer stands firm, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price of $15,000, but is getting closer. There is still room for negotiation, and buying from John now would be suboptimal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $17,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}
