Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. While I'm confident you'd see significant benefit from this product, I understand budget constraints. Let's settle at $15,500 and call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,500 is closer, but I need to be a little more frugal. How about $12,000, my final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet a price point that's acceptable.  He's at his highest offer ($12,000), which is still below my minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap significantly, and waiting risks getting a worse offer or losing John's guaranteed purchase."
