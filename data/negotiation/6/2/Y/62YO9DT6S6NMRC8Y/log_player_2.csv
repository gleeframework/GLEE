# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still very advantageous to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $8,000.
