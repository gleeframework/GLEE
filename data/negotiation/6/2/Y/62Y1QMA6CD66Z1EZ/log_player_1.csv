{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. This helps build a positive rapport and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

* By starting at $1,200,000, I have a buffer for potential counteroffers.
* I can adjust the price in subsequent counteroffers depending on Bob's response and my assessment of his negotiating strategy.
* I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob break down. This keeps me in control of the situation and prevents me from accepting a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. 
* **My goal:** I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions. This will give me more control over the negotiation. 
* **Safety net:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""compromise"" aspect of the counteroffer to make it more appealing to Bob. I'm also reminding him of the potential benefits of the deal for both of us.
* **Strategy:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation. However, I'm still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired outcome. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach a final agreement. If Bob still rejects, I will re-evaluate my options and decide whether to make a further counteroffer or sell to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm not comfortable with $1,000,000, I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price that much, especially after making several concessions. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoid further negotiation with Bob that might result in an unfavorable outcome."
