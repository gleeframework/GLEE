Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Potential for counteroffer:**  I anticipate Bob may counteroffer, which will allow me to adjust my price accordingly.
* **John as backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence in my negotiation position. 

Let me know if Bob accepts, rejects, or makes a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation,  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I can use the next round to propose a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 

I'm confident I can secure a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to a compromise:** My counteroffer of $95 is a significant step up from Bob's offer but still below my starting point. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm positioning this as a ""meet in the middle"" approach, which can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still above his initial offer, showcasing my value for the product. 

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while also demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get it for $85. That's a fair price for both of us, considering I can buy it elsewhere for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm on his price:** Despite my counteroffer, Bob remains fixed on $85. This indicates he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continued negotiation could be time-consuming, and I risk losing out on John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Maximizing profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest profit at this point, exceeding my minimum acceptable price and securing a reliable deal. 

While I'm willing to negotiate, John's offer provides a clear path to maximizing my earnings."
