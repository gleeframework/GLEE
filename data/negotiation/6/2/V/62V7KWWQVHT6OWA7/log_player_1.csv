Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I'm not comfortable starting at $1,400,000. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,325,000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still offering you a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Stronger Position:** Bob has moved closer to your price twice now, indicating he's serious about the purchase. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk Bob walks away.  Accepting now secures the deal."
