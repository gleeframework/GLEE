"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but that price point is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000 and see if we can make a deal?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger jump than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $975,000? I think that's fair for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me here.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you consider $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get a bit more than that. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. Let's see if we can make it work.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we compromise at $1,025,000 and call it a deal? This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,025,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
