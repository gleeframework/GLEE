Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to budge further, and you've already made several counteroffers. You've also negotiated down to $105, which is within your budget, but not your desired price.  Given that you have limited rounds remaining, and John is offering a better price, it's time to secure the product from John."
