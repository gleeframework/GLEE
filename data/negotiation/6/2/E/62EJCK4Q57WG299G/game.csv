"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the product, which brings the price down to $10,500, but I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty and a free maintenance package. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.",10500.0,Alice,5,
