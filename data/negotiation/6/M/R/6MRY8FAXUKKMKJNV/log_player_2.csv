# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects both its value and my need to secure a fair return.  I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This allows for a substantial profit for you while still giving me a significant return on my investment. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
