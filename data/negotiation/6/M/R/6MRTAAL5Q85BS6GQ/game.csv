"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique features and benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for a product with unique features, but I'm not willing to go higher than that.",775000.0,Bob,4,
