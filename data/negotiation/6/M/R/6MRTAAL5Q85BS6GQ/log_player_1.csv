"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique features and benefits that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for a product with unique features, but I'm not willing to go higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to meet the minimum price of $800,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a loss, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum desired price."
