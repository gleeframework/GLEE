"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $9,750? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,5,
