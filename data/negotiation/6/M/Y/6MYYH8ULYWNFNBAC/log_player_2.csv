"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $1,200,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the potential value it holds for your business. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still above Bob's maximum budget.**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and $1,400,000 is still too high for him.
* **Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice or further negotiation.**  Bob may be able to get a better price by holding firm on his budget."
