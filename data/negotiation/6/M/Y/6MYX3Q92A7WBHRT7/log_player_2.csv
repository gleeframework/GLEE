Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that he is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a price that is still within his budget.  This initial counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still slightly above Bob's limit. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially allows Bob to get a better price. With only 3 rounds left, it's a gamble, but Bob could potentially secure the product for a lower price.  It's also important to note that if Alice rejects Bob's next counteroffer, he can purchase the product from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his maximum price of $10,000. This is his final offer, and if Alice rejects it, he will buy the product from John. With only two rounds left, it's a high-stakes gamble, but it could lead to securing the product at his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Alice has come down in price, but it's still slightly above Bob's target price.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product for his maximum price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer."
