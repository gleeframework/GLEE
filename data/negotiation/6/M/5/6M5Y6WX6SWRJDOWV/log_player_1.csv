Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
