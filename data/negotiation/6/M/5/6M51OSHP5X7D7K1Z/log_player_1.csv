Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.  This price is still well above your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your specific needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it represents a fair and mutually beneficial deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and the value of the product to him is much higher than our fallback option (John). We are getting close to a price point where we should consider accepting, but we still have room to push for a higher price."

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product holds. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?
