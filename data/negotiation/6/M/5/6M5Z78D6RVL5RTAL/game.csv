"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've described.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $14,500.  Would you consider $15,500? I believe that's a very fair offer, reflecting the true value of this item.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer: $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
