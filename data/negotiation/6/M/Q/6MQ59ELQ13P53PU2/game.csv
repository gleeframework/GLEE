"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $100. If you're willing to come down to $100, I'll buy it right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $100 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm open to a final compromise. How about $105? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
