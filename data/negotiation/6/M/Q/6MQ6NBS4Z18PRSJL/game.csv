"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you substantial potential for profit.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but I need to see some movement on your end to justify going any higher.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. To show I'm serious about reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial opportunity.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a significant gap for me. I can go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
