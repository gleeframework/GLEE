"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm position. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential"" and ""return,"" aiming to shift Bob's focus toward future gains rather than just the immediate price. 
* **Leaving Room:** This high starting point allows me to strategically make concessions in later rounds while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you substantial potential for profit."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  I've made a considerable drop from my initial offer to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming high above both my floor and Bob's offer.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential for profit to gently steer Bob away from focusing solely on his initial valuation.
* **Gauge Interest:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how serious Bob is and how much further I might need to adjust my approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but I need to see some movement on your end to justify going any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still far apart. It's too early to settle, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John.  I need to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. To show I'm serious about reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Drop:** I've made another substantial decrease to demonstrate my willingness to move towards a deal and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Finality:** This offer is getting closer to my absolute bottom line.  I need to convey a sense of urgency and finality to encourage a serious counteroffer from Bob.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I've made significant concessions, prompting Bob to recognize the value of the deal and reciprocate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a significant gap for me. I can go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit & Competition:** Bob has explicitly stated his absolute limit is $1,000,000 and revealed he knows about John's offer. This eliminates my leverage for negotiation.
* **No More Room for Profit:**  Bob's final offer is my exact break-even point.  Continuing the negotiation would only risk a potential loss if I concede further.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a sure $1,500,000 with no further negotiation needed. This is the most profitable and secure option at this stage."
