"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $9,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."

This is a reasonable counteroffer, offering a price slightly above what the product is worth to Alice, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Alice will accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above what you want to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's desired price but still below her last offer. This shows you are willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice keeps increasing her price, and it seems she's not willing to go lower.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $10,000.  You've already negotiated a bit, but you don't want to risk getting stuck with a price you're not happy with.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
