"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $150 for the product.  What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $175? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can agree on it.",150.0,Bob,4,
