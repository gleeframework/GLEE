"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to accept her initial price.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $950,000 is a good price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer, and I might end up paying more or having to buy from John.  It's better to lock in this price before she changes her mind."
