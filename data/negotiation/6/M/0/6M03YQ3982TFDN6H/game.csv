"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant and I can't go as low as $600,000.  Would you consider $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
