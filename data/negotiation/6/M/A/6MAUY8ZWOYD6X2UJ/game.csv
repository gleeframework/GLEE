"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value and our ongoing negotiation.  Let's close the deal at this point.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's aim for $9,250,  which is still a good price for you considering your original asking price and your willingness to negotiate. This price allows us to both benefit from the deal. ",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $9,375, which is a fair price considering my initial offer and your willingness to negotiate.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal now.",9375.0,Alice,7,
