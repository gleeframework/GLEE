"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer close to my maximum budget, but leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll continue negotiating and see if I can push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price. I've increased my offer from $8,500 to $9,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a good compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value and our ongoing negotiation.  Let's close the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable paying that much.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice has been consistently coming down in price. I'll try to get a lower price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's aim for $9,250,  which is still a good price for you considering your original asking price and your willingness to negotiate. This price allows us to both benefit from the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going for a smaller increment this time, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but still want a price within my budget.  This counteroffer is a good compromise as it's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $9,375, which is a fair price considering my initial offer and your willingness to negotiate.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price, $9,375 is still above my preferred budget.  Given that I have limited rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm confident I can secure the product from John for $8,000, which is significantly better than the current offer from Alice.  It's time to take the safe route and buy from John."
