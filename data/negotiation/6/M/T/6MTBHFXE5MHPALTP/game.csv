"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
