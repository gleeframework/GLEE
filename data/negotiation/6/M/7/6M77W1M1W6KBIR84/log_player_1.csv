Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely) and still allows you to profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.

This strategy aims to get the best possible outcome with Bob while ensuring a profitable sale either way."
