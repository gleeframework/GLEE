I'm offering the product to Bob for $110.  This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and lower than the value Bob places on it ($120). This gives Bob a good deal while ensuring I earn a significant profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $80, though I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price."
