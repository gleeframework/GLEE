"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $1,075,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle right in the middle at $987,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our back and forth, but I have to be honest,  $987,500 is cutting it too close. I'm open to making this work, but I need to see a price that reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
