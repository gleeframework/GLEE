Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives the offer as a good deal.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that John exists provides a strong fallback position, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
