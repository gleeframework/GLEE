"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's best to reject and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price range.  There's still room to negotiate further, and Bob has a solid alternative in John, so there's no rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,500 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,500, which is $11,250. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's target:**  $11,250 is very close to Bob's last offer of $11,000.  
* **Risk of going higher:** If Bob rejects, there's a chance Alice will counteroffer with a price closer to her original $11,500.
* **Time is ticking:** With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiations will lead to a price closer to John's $15,000. 

While Bob could try to negotiate a little lower, accepting at this point minimizes the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
