"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it's worth every penny of my asking price of $150."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
Reason:Bob is offering $135 which is more than my minimum selling point of $120. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation failing altogether.
