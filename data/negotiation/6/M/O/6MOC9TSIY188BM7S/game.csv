"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a decent price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
