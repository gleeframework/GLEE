{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, Bob's offer of $125 is still above my minimum of $100 and worth more than selling to John. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
