"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what you're currently considering. However, I understand the importance of finding a fair price for both parties. I propose selling the product to you for $120. This price reflects the product's true worth while allowing us to reach an agreement that benefits us both. I look forward to your response.",120.0,Alice,1,
