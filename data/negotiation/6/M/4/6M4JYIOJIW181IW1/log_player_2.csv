"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $80 on this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the $80 price point.  While Alice has moved closer, it's worth seeing if she'll come down further. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always opt to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $92.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above his target.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not guaranteed that Alice will come down to $80, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on the product. Buying from John at $80 guarantees him the product at his desired price."
