We're still getting closer to Bob's value and are far above our fallback option.  There's room to negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

}

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $95 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and a good profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or your offers becoming too low. Accepting now secures a solid profit.
* **Limited Rounds:** With fewer rounds left, Bob is less likely to make a significantly better offer."
