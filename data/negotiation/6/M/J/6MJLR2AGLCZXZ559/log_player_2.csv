Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

This offer is close to my maximum but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me halfway."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm going to raise my offer a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than Alice's last offer.  We're getting closer, and I think this might be a good compromise."
