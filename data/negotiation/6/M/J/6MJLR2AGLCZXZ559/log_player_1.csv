Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below what I would get from John. This gives me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $130 is still above my minimum and it seems like we've reached a reasonable compromise. It's also better than selling to John for $150, as I'd be losing $20 in potential profit."
