Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. It's time to apply a bit more pressure and see how much he's willing to budge."

Round 6

Bob seems firm on his price, and while we could push for more, it's getting risky.  Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
