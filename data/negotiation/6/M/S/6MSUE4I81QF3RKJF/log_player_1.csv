"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm framing it as a fair deal based on the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I have 9 rounds left, so I have time to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value you've stated, but also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm bridging the gap by offering a price closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the fairness of the offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone, emphasizing cooperation and a win-win scenario. 
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,400,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, allowing me room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This price recognizes the value you've placed on it, while still allowing me to make a worthwhile purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Time for another counteroffer:** I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to keep negotiating.
* **Selling to John is still a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This price is a significant compromise for me, but I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to reach a win-win agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's in the middle of my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,300,000), showing a genuine effort to find a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the fact that this offer represents a significant concession from my side, making it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language that suggests a desire to finalize the deal, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Still above Minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer to a deal I can accept."
