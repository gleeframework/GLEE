"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value you've stated, but also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'd like to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This price recognizes the value you've placed on it, while still allowing me to make a worthwhile purchase.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This price is a significant compromise for me, but I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to reach a win-win agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
