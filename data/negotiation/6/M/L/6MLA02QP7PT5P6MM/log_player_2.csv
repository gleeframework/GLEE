Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of our last two offers. I'll come down to $1,077,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,077,500 is very close to my desired price, and I only have one round left to negotiate.  While I could reject and try for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll budge further, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy the product. 

It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's within my budget and only slightly higher than my initial goal."
