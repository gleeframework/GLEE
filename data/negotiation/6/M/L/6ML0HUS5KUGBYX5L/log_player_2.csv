Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $8,500. I can offer you a compromise at $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting her offer of $9,100 secures a reasonable price for the product and avoids the risk of her raising her price or the negotiation falling through."
