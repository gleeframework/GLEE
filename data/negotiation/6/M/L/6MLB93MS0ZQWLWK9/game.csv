"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
