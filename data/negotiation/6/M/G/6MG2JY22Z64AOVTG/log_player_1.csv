"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I have 9 rounds left to try and get closer to my initial target of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting close to my minimum, but it's still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I still have time to secure a better price, and I'm not desperate to close the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is on, but I'm still determined to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $15,000.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be realistic about the potential for a higher offer from Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept my minimum, and I can avoid having to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer to my minimum price is low.  It's better to avoid further negotiation and accept the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
