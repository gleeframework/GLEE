Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $850,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's potential while still offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
