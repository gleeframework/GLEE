"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to me. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is too high. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a reasonable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's above my budget and not a fair price for the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows me to acquire it within my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
