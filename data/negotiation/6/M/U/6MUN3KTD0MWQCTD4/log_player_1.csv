Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows me to acquire it within my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
