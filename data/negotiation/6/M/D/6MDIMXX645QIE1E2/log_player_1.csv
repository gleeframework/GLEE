Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll come down to $15,500.  This is a good compromise, and it's still above your initial offer.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I won't go any lower."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I understand that $15,500 is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't agree to that price.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 to close the deal.  If that's not possible, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum. I've been flexible in my negotiations, but I'm not willing to drop below my threshold. It's time to move on to my guaranteed sale with John."
