"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too far off my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let me know your thoughts.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. While $16,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll come down to $15,500.  This is a good compromise, and it's still above your initial offer.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I won't go any lower.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I understand that $15,500 is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't agree to that price.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 to close the deal.  If that's not possible, I might have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
