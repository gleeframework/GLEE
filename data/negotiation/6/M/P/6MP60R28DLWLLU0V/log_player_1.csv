Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While a much lower price might be tempting, it could make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product."
