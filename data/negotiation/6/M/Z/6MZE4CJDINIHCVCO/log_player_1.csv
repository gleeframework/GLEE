Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:** The message is positive and expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** The question invites Bob to engage and encourages a counteroffer if he's interested.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price (e.g., $95).
* If his counteroffer is acceptable, I'll accept it to secure the sale.
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I'll switch to John to ensure I get at least $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **No point in further negotiation:**  There's no real benefit to counter-offering or continuing the negotiation. I've already reached my minimum.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting the offer secures the sale and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might lead to no sale at all. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction."
