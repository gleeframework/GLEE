"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, which would be $82.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",82.5,Alice,5,
