Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You want at least $8,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so he has incentive to negotiate.

By starting with this offer, you are setting a high bar while still leaving room for a potential deal that benefits both parties."
