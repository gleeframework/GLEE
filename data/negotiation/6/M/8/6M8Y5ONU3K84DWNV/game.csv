"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both are willing to be flexible.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still at $1,000,000.
