"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My initial price is $950,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to reflect your concerns. This price is still a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. I truly believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Alice,5,
