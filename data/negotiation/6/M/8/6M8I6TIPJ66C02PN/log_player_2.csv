"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice further.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good price, as it's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and still allows Alice to make a profit.  There's no guarantee that he'll be able to get a lower price in the next round, so accepting at this point is the most sensible choice."
