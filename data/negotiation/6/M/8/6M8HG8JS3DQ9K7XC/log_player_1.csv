{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product, and this initial price gives me a good starting point to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down to $88 for the product. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 88}
