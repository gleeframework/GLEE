"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $12,000, given its potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high. You can likely get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if she'll come down."
