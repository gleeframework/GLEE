"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate and gauge Bob's interest while keeping the value of the product well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is still significantly more than my minimum, but it shows a willingness to negotiate. It also keeps the price higher than what John is offering, so I'm still incentivized to close a deal with Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a price higher than $1,250,000.  While John is a safe option, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob with more negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price again, but still holding out for a higher price than Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility without completely giving up my bargaining power."

I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze a little more out of him."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000} 
```

I'm offering $1,280,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to close the deal but still aiming for a price slightly above Bob's last offer. With fewer rounds left, I need to start closing the gap."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob is not moving much closer to my desired price.  To avoid the risk of settling for a lower price, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a safe and secure option that meets my minimum requirement."
