"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to see if Bob is truly interested and what his budget might be. This gives me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $18,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer, showing my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $16,000 is still a good amount and significantly better than selling to John for $15,000.  It's also likely I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
