Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its potential but staying within my financial limits.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is significant. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident in its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant step towards your valuation while staying within my budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, the offers are escalating too slowly.  It's unlikely Bob will reach a price point that makes it worthwhile for me to continue negotiations when I have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John."
