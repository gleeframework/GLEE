"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $120, but $110 is still too close to that limit.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer:**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable.**  $102 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. 
* **Negotiation is likely to continue.**  While Alice is willing to negotiate, it's unclear how much further she'll drop the price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance you might get a better deal, but you also risk Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and ending up with no deal.  It's better to take this reasonable offer and secure the product."
