Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,950,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive the final price as more reasonable, even if it's still above his initial valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to reduce the price slightly while still securing a significant profit.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you're not pressured to accept any offer below that amount.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but acknowledges the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  You can adjust the initial price based on your risk appetite and understanding of Bob's negotiating style."
