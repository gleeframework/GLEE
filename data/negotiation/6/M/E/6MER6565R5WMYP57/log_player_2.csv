"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $10,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to come down to $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still a better price than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
