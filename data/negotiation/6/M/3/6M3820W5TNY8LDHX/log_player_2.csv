"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and hopefully makes a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but the product has significant value beyond $1,050,000. I could consider coming down to $1,125,000.  Let me know if that would be workable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer is still above Bob's maximum of $1,000,000. Rejecting and countering again allows Bob to continue negotiating towards his desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we've both established.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further or that the negotiation could drag on.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it's the most financially sound decision for Bob to buy the product from John. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
