"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and hopefully makes a good starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but the product has significant value beyond $1,050,000. I could consider coming down to $1,125,000.  Let me know if that would be workable for you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we've both established.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
