"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
