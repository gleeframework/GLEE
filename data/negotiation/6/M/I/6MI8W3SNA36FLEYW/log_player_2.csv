Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this point, it's unlikely she'll go below $105, and we know we can get the product for $100 from John. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
