"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than your target of $12,000. 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  You're aiming for the lowest price possible. 
*  Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
*  This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to be fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. How about $9,500? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than your ideal price, but getting closer. 
* You have more rounds to negotiate and you are still aiming to save as much as possible.
* Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit high,  but I'm willing to pay $9,250.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* $9,250 is a good compromise point - it's a reasonable price for you, and it might be attractive enough for Alice to consider. 
* You still have six rounds left, so there's room for more negotiation if needed."
