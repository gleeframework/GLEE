"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I'm confident you'll see the value and we can make this a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $9,500 is too high. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so you should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
