"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and the fact that it is worth $8000 to you, I would like to propose a price of $9500. This offers a reasonable profit for me while still providing you with a significant saving compared to its market value. I look forward to your response.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. This is still a significant discount from the market value, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate as well. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $8700 for the product.
