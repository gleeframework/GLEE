""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects its inherent worth and potential return on investment.  Let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering. While $850,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as your offer. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000?  This price recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your initial investment."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,075,000 is still too far from my price point.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which reflects the value I place on the product and represents a significant compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point. We are still in a position to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference again and agree on $1,012,500? This shows my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1,012,500 is simply not within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a significant amount for me and a step closer to your last offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but at this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a significantly better deal within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would net us $975,000. Selling to John guarantees us $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed profit."
