Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering. While $850,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as your offer. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
