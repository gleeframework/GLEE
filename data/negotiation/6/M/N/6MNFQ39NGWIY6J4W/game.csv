"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects its inherent worth and potential return on investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering. While $850,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as your offer. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000?  This price recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your initial investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,075,000 is still too far from my price point.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which reflects the value I place on the product and represents a significant compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference again and agree on $1,012,500? This shows my commitment to reaching a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1,012,500 is simply not within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a significant amount for me and a step closer to your last offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",975000.0,Bob,6,
