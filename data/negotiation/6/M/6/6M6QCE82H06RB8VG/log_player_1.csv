Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  John's offer is my minimum price, and it's a sure deal."
