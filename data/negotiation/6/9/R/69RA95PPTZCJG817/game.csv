,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for 100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for 80. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for 95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",95.0,Alice,5,
