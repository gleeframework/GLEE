"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $950000 is getting closer to the sweet spot. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
