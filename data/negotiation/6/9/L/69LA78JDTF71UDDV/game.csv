"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,600,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I bring to the table.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  It shows me you're serious about this product. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,200,000 that I can accept.  This is non-negotiable. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 â€“ it's a final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
