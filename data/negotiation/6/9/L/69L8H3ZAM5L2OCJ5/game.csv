"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. Would you consider $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. If you're willing to agree to $875,000, we have an agreement. This is my absolute best offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
