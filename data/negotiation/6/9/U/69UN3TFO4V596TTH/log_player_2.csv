"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds immense value for us, but its true worth to you surpasses $1,500,000. After careful consideration, I am extending a special offer to you to purchase this product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount compared to its intrinsic value, aiming to ensure both a fair transaction and a chance for you to benefit from its unparalleled quality. I trust that you will find this proposal compelling and look forward to discussing further details with you. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is full of fluff about the product's value, the offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
