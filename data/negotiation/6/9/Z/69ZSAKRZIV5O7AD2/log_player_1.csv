Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I believe this price is ambitious, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and be prepared to make further counteroffers based on his proposal and my own assessment of the product's value to him. 

It's important to note that while John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. This negotiation strategy aims to maximize my profit by pushing for the highest possible sale price while still remaining open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I cannot accept such a low price. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it acknowledges Bob's perspective and opens the door for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  If I reject this offer, I'm likely to end up selling to John for $1,500,000. It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
