Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $9,500 is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Protects your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Shows confidence:**  By starting high, you demonstrate belief in your product's worth. 

Remember, the negotiation is a dynamic process. We'll adapt based on Bob's response and the information available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within a budget of $8000 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, there's still potential to get a higher price. We'll try to negotiate a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

We'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $8,000, aiming to split the difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll try to meet you closer to my budget. How about $8200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 below our previous counteroffer of $8,500.  This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting. 

**Considerations:**

* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and may not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Opportunity cost:** By accepting, we can secure a sale at a price closer to our desired range and avoid risking the deal falling through entirely.
* **Building a relationship:**  Agreeing to a compromise can foster a positive relationship with Bob for future transactions."
