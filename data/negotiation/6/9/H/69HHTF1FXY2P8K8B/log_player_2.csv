"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $100. 
* There is room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
