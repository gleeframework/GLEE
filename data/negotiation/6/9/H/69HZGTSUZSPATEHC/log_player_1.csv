# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I know the product is worth more. I want to try to get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable outcome."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for the compromise. I understand the product's potential, but I still think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum price.  I've already stated my willingness to negotiate, and accepting this offer guarantees the sale.  It's also the same price I could get from John, so there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
