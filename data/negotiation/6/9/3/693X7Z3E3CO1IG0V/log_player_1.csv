Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120.  I think it would be a great fit for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its worth to me, the message subtly implies value by suggesting it's a ""great fit"".
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open-ended (""What do you think?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have the security of John's guaranteed purchase at $80."
