"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  I know this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worth it in the long run.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up.",20000.0,Alice,1,
