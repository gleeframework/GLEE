,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9000 for this.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'd be willing to pay $8500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $8750. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",8750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'd be willing to pay $8500, which is the same price I offered earlier. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,6,
