"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and I can already sell it to John for that price. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but $8,500 is too low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 for this.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'd be willing to pay $8500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm still holding out for a better price. While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $8,750. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'd be willing to pay $8500, which is the same price I offered earlier. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached the point where I'm not confident Bob will budge from his $8,500 offer.  I can't risk going any lower and losing out on a better price. I'll sell to John for $10,000."
