"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. Let's discuss how we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering our costs and the value proposition, we're unable to match your offer directly. We propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable margin while still being competitive. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is lower than the original price, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to present a counterproposal. We are willing to consider $10,800 as the final price for the product. This allows us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is closer to Bob's target price of $10,000.  At this point, the potential savings of a few hundred dollars by continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and avoids the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
