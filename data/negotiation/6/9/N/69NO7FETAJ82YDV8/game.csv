"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, $1,312,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,275,000. This is a fair price that represents a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to achieve our objectives. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of time. If we can't come to an agreement, I have another interested party who is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000. Let's make a deal!",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued efforts, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate.
