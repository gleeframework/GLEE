(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and I have multiple rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $65, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to my target price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I've already shown Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price if I keep pushing. There's a chance she'll come down further to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $70.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to meet me in the middle."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $85 is closer to my goal than John's price, I still see potential for further negotiation.  Alice is clearly flexible and has already moved a little closer to my preferred price. I have several rounds left to work with, and I'm determined to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again to $75. This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows her that I'm serious about making a deal but that I still have a limit on what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I have several rounds left to work with and I'm determined to get the best deal possible. If I can get a lower price, it's worth waiting to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer once again to $80.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal and willing to compromise.  It also demonstrates that I'm prepared to meet her halfway.  We're down to our last few rounds, so I'm hoping this final push will convince her to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer is only $5 less than John's price. I'm not willing to risk it and keep negotiating.  I'm better off going with John to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
