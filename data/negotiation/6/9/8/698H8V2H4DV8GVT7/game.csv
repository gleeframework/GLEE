"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
