{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows you to make concessions if needed without falling below your floor. 
* **It's a clear starting point:**  This sets a specific price for Bob to consider and respond to.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also potentially securing a sale.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

I've made a smaller counteroffer, aiming to meet Bob halfway. This keeps the negotiations moving while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer carefully. I would like to counter with $1,125,000. This is a compromise that allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is close enough to my desired range.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,150,000, continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  It's time to secure the sale."
