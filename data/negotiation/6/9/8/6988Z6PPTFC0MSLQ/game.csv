"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is tempting, it's unfortunately too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
