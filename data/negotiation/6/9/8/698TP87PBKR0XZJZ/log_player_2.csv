"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds and the ability to walk away to John, you're in a good position to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially establish a lower price range for the product.  The goal is to create some distance between our positions and allow for multiple rounds of negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my ideal target. I'm going to continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further. I have more rounds available, and I'm not in a rush to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 275000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but I still believe we can do better.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to my target. With five rounds left, I have time to explore options and potentially secure a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer, but it's still higher than my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and try to reach a better price.  I have three rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a deal closer to my desired price point."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not satisfied. I have one round left, and I'm going to try to squeeze out a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer, knowing that if it's rejected, I can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer again, but it's still below Alice's last offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to buy from John. However, I'm hopeful that Alice will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
