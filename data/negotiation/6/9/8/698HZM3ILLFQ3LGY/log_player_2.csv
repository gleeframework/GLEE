"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. It's worth exploring counteroffers to try and get a lower price.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $875,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still a bit high. Bob can likely squeeze out a better price with another counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would be a significantly worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about $860,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $860,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $860,000. How about $872,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $872,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $872,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's target.  Bob has a few rounds left and should continue to try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John would be a worse deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not ready to go lower than $872,500.  However, I'm still aiming for $865,000.  This is a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 865000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting close to considering your offer, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $872,500 and $865,000. How about $868,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $868,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $868,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $868,750 is very close to his target price of $865,000.  With only 3 rounds remaining, there is a significant risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, or that Bob might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure the product within the given budget and timeframe."
