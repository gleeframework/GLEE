"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, my budget is closer to $950,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're serious about selling this product and I want to make this work.  Would you be willing to settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,012,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
