Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, leaving room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob, but doesn't immediately give him the best deal. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is my counteroffer to Bob. I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. It's a significant improvement over John's offer. It's time to close the deal with Bob."
