"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $13,500. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you might encourage her to come down closer to her value of $12,000.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John for $15,000, but there's a good chance you can get a better deal from Alice."
