Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll receive from the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. I'm willing to offer $9,500. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $8,000.

Bob is highly unlikely to go above his budget, and it seems we've reached an impasse. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss. It's in my best interest to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
