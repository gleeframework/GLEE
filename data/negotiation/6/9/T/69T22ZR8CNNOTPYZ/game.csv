"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,250. This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close the deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
