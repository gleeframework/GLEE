"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,250,000 is still a little too steep for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,125,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
