Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to sell it for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $125 is less than what Bob thinks the product is worth, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** By stating Bob's perceived value, you're starting the negotiation from a place of understanding and making it clear you're open to a deal. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my initial offer of $125.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial price of $125.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $122.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to get closer to your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $122.50. I'm willing to meet you at $118. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $118 is not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $100. It's also a good compromise since it's closer to Bob's offer than my previous counteroffer."
