"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Opening with a high price of $2,000,000 sets a strong initial expectation and allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the unique value and opportunity, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites Bob to engage in dialogue and allows for potential counteroffers.

**Note:** I'm choosing to go with a higher offer than the minimum of $1,500,000 because I'm aiming to get the best possible price. However, it's important to be aware of potential risks associated with a high initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1500000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** While $1,500,000 is the minimum acceptable price for Alice, there's still room for negotiation. The product is worth more to her than that, and she can potentially get a better price.
* **Exploring Options:**  Rejecting the initial offer allows Alice to explore if Bob is willing to go higher. It signals that Alice is not desperate to sell at the minimum price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains leverage and prevents Alice from being locked into the minimum price too early.

**Next Steps:**

Alice will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $1,500,000 to see if Bob is willing to budge. She will need to consider the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. While I value the product at a higher amount, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects the value I'm offering and allows for a reasonable deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Appealing to Logic:** Presenting $1,750,000 as a midpoint creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Note:** Alice is taking a calculated risk by offering a lower price than her initial offer. However, she believes that this counteroffer is fair and has a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
