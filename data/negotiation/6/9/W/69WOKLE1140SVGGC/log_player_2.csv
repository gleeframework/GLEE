It's too expensive for me at $175. I'll try to negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate down from her initial offer."

While I'd prefer to pay less, $135 is within my budget and better than John's offer. It's worth taking this deal before Alice changes her mind."
