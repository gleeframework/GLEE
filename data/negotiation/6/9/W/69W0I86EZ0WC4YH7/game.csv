"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
