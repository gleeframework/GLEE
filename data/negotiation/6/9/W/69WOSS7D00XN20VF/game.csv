"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial price, considering the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $990,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",990000.0,Bob,4,
