"Alice, that's a great offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for my product. I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,5,
