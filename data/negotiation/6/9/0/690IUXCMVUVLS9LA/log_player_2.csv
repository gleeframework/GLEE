Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I would like to propose a final offer of $8,900 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit above your target price. You can likely continue negotiating, but you risk going through more rounds and wasting time.  Since John is offering the product for your target price, it's best to take the deal and avoid further negotiation."
