"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $110, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $80, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  It's still a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming for a lower price, and $100 is still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is closer to your last offer and still within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
