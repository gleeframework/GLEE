"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counteroffer.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying at a price that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
