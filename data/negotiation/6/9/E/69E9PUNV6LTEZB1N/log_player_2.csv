{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's still within his budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still demonstrating a genuine interest in the product."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob, as it's well within his budget of $12,000 and significantly lower than the price he would pay from John.  Accepting this offer ensures a successful deal while still saving a substantial amount of money."
