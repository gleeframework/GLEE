"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $17,000.  This feels like a fair price considering its benefits.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is still lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $14,500. This offer stands firm, as I believe it's a very reasonable compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
