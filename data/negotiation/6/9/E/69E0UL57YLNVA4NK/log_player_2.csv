"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $95 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you. You can get it for $100 from John. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:

You are still better off going to John at this point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your original price, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about $87?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 87}
