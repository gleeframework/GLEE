Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more, while also leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to Bob for $80 than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same price."
