"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, which might encourage him to accept.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm stating that my price is ""fair"" to me, implying I'm open to negotiation, but not willing to sell for significantly less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point, it's still above my minimum threshold. There's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my negotiating power and show that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John now would be a lower profit than Bob's offer. However,  I'm willing to risk a slightly lower price in the hopes of getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $10,000 is closer to where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:**  This phrasing suggests a collaborative approach and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $11,000 is still a substantial profit for me, and I believe I can get a better deal than selling to John."
