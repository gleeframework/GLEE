Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This is my final offer.
