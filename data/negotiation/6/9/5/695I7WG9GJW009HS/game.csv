"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a fortune. I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's extremely fair to both of us. Let's start with $1,200,000. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to spend. How about we aim for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value you see in the product, but I must stick to my budget. I'd like to propose $1,025,000. It's a bit closer to your initial offer, while still respecting my financial limits.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
