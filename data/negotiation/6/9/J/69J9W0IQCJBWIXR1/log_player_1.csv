Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also confident I can get at least $100 from John if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I think $105 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk going another round. I've already lowered my price twice, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  John is a sure thing, and I'm happy to sell to him for $100."
