Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately.  This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is still above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping we can reach a deal closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is closer to my desired profit, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to risk losing even more profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
