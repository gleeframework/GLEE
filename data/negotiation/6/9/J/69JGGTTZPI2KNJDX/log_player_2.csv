"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique value, so I'm starting the price at $15,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth. You can definitely get a better price by rejecting this initial offer or going with John."
