Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its unique value, so I'm starting the price at $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value,""  Alice subtly implies that the product is worth more than Bob might initially think. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue and reveal how interested he truly is. This will help Alice gauge whether to hold firm on the price or potentially negotiate.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has the security of selling to John for $10,000. This means she can afford to be somewhat firm in her negotiations with Bob."
