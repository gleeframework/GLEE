Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, starting slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Value Proposition:**  By emphasizing ""value"" in your message, you aim to frame the price as justified even though Bob might not perceive its worth to be that high. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between getting the best price from Bob and ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
