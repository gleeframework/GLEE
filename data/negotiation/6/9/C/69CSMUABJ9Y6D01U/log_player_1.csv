Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to frame the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, giving me confidence to hold out for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I'm confident that I can get a better price than $120, so I'm going to counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  John's offer provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm counteroffering at $140, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $120 and my previous offer of $175. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Open to compromise:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm confident that I can get a better price than $120, but I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's within a reasonable range.
* **Risk of losing deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk he might walk away completely, forcing me to sell to John for only $150. 
* **Time factor:**  Negotiating further could drag on, and I don't want to waste time if I can get a decent price now.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a good compromise, and it's better than risking losing the sale altogether."
