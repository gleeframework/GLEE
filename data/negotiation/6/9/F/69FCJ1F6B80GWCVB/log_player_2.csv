"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than what Alice values the product at, you know you can get it for $100 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with your best option."
