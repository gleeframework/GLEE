Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob while still exceeding your minimum.  Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its benefits.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and hints at the product's value without overselling it.
* **Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Counter:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. He might try to negotiate the price closer to his $1,200,000 valuation.
* **Your Walk-Away Point:** Remember, you have a strong alternative with John. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offer is too low."
