Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it while still leaving some room for negotiation.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
