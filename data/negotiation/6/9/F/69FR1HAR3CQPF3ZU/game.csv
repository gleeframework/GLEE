"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about we set the price at $9,500? This allows us to stay closer to your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",9500.0,Alice,3,
