{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Sets a high bar:** It's ambitious, but not unreasonable, given your minimum value of $800,000.
* **Opens the door for negotiation:** You've left room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the conversation open.
* **Highlights the value:** You mention ""unique opportunity"" and ""potential"" to pique Bob's interest.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your earnings.  If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum value:**  You've stated that the product is worth no less than $800,000 to you. Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. You can still try to get closer to your desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  You have a guaranteed $800,000 from John. This gives you leverage to continue negotiating with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your minimum value and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm prepared to sell for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your minimum:**  This price is closer to your $800,000 minimum, while still giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Shows flexibility:**  You've shown willingness to negotiate, which can keep Bob engaged.
* **Reiterates value:** You remind Bob of the product's worth, justifying your counteroffer.

This counteroffer allows for more back-and-forth with Bob, hopefully leading to a deal closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above your minimum:**  $850,000 is higher than your minimum value of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation is likely to be difficult:** You've already made a concession from $900,000 to $850,000.  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely. 

It's better to secure a profitable deal at $850,000 than to risk a lower price or no deal at all."
