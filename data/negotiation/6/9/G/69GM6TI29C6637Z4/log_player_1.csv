{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You are aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This is crucial information.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the offer is strong, the slightly negotiable price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Backup Plan (John):** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so there's no need to go below that price.

**The offer aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the potential profit while considering Bob's willingness to pay.**"
