"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $95 for this transaction? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in our product. To try to find common ground, how about we aim for $85 for this transaction? This still allows us to cover our costs while making the product accessible to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $85 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
