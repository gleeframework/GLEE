"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal for both of us, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is a good deal, but you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a later round to get the sale."
