"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product. ",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $9500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,5,
