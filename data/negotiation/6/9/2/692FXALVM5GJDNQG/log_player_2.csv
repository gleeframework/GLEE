"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept it.  You should counter-offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your budget, but closer to your maximum price point. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $9500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above your budget. Although you have the option to counteroffer again, it's likely Alice will not budge further, making it a risky proposition. At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John."
