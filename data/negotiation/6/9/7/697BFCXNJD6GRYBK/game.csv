"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $11,500 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, Bob. But $10,500 is still a bit short of my target. I can do $11,250, but that's as high as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really close now.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle this right now at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting a bit too close to the end, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11,000, but that's it. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What's your final decision?",11000.0,Alice,9,
