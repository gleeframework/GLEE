"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product's performance. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but $950,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $750,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not ready to accept $825,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved very little in her counteroffer.  Her latest offer is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down much further.  Bob has already made several counteroffers, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This ensures he gets the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock with Alice."
