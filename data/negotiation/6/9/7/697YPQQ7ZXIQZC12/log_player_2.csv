"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get the product for $80 from John, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives me room to increase my offer in later rounds while still staying below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is way below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than I want to pay. I'll counter with an offer closer to my limit, hoping she'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle on $70?  That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but staying firm below my $80 limit. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to accept a lower price or risk me walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $70 is simply not enough.  Let's try $85. It's closer to my minimum, and it gives you a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one! Alice is getting very close to my limit, and $85 is a decent price. However, I know I can get it for $80 from John. It's worth one more try to see if Alice will come down those last few dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's absolutely my final offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm making one final push, offering a slight increase to entice Alice while drawing a firm line. This puts the ball in her court. If she rejects, I'll walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable selling for $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice finally agreed to my price! It took some negotiation, but I managed to get the product for my target price of $80. This is a win!"
