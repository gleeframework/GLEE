{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  You're leaving room for negotiation and potential profit for Bob. 
* **It's a clear signal of your desired price:** You're communicating your seriousness while leaving space for negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is still a decent price, it's worth seeing if we can get closer to our initial asking price.  We'll counter Bob's offer and aim for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is very close to our desired price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for both of us and a better price than John is offering. Let's accept and close this deal!"
