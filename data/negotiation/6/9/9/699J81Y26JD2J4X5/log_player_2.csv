"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiations than to settle for a price you're not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1100000, which is $1250000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still not within your ideal range.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get closer to $1,000,000.  At this point, you're still better off trying to make a deal with Alice than going with John, since you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  I think this is a fair offer, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1150000, which is $1200000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is getting close to your budget, it's still worth continuing to negotiate. At this point, you're still better off trying to make a deal with Alice than going with John. It's worth pushing for a lower price as there are still a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're getting close, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering our previous negotiations and the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1175000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1175000, which is $1187500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached round 9 and Alice's final offer is $1,187,500.  You are within a small range of your desired price of $1,000,000, but given you have only one round remaining, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. You can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, securing a better deal and avoiding the potential for a failed negotiation with Alice."
