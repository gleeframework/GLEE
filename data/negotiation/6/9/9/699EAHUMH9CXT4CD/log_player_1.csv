Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be of great value to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 ensures Alice won't be forced to go below her minimum acceptable price."
