Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially allowing you to still get a higher price. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  $14,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Avoid Pushing Bob Away:** Starting too high (e.g., $14,500) might make Bob immediately walk away, forcing you to settle for John's lower offer. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price he finds acceptable, and you maximize your profit beyond your guaranteed sale price."
