Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price, given its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.
