"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,100,000 for this product. It's a fair price, given its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This allows us both to get a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
