"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
