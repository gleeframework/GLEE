Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down a bit, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price signals that Alice understands the product's value to Bob but isn't trying to take every last dollar. This can make Bob more receptive. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000, so she can afford to be a bit bolder with her initial offer to Bob."
