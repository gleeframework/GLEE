Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $140. This is still a fair price considering what the product is worth to me, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable compromise for Bob as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's not ideal to lose the potential for a higher price with Bob, but $150 is still a good deal for me."
