,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $130? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I think that's a more comfortable price range for me.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",115.0,Bob,6,
