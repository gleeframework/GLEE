Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit. Offering a price closer to $150 increases your potential earnings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, starting with $130 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
