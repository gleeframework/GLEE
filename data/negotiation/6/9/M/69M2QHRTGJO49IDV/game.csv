"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1200000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is still a significant investment and reflects the potential of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1100000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1050000.  This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it shows my seriousness in acquiring this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
