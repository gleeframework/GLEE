"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is well above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $950,000. I'm confident this price is fair, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. While I value this product,  $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm firm on $900,000.  This price is a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,000,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to accept $950000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting close to your desired price, $975,000 is still outside of your budget. You have only one round left, and it's highly unlikely Alice will come down to your price. It's more beneficial to buy the product from John at $800,000, securing a good deal and avoiding the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
