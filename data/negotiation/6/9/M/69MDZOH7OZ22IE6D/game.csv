"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $950000. I'm confident this price is fair, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'll meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. While I value this product,  $1050000 is still a stretch for me. I'm firm on $900000.  This price is a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'll make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $1000000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to offer $950000 for it. This is a fair price that would make us both happy. I truly believe this is the closest we can get to a mutually agreeable price. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to accept $950000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,9,
