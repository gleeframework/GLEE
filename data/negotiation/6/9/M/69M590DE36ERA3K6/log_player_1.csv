Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is even higher for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your $8,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and reach a price closer to $15,000.
* **It shows you're serious:** By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and close a deal. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more. How about $10,000?  This still leaves us both with a decent profit, and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent profit, we can aim for a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, we can  counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to our initial offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```
 
By counteroffering at $11,000, we're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate, but we're also standing our ground. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it leaves room for a final agreement."
