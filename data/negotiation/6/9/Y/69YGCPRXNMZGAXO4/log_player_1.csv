{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, knowing he may counter-offer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to my ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be a great investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is above my minimum price of $10,000 and is a good compromise. It's in my best interest to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
