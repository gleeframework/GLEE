Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, giving you a decent profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), leaving room for potential negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open for a potentially higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my initial offer of $120.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  $110 is more than Bob's $100, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:**  $110 is less than my initial $120, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving and potentially secure a price closer to my target while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $105 is significantly better than selling to John for $80.  Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and ends the negotiation."
