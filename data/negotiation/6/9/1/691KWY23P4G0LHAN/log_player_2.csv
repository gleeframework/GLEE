"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and to be fair, I won't accept anything less than $120 from anyone else. How about we split the difference and make it $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
