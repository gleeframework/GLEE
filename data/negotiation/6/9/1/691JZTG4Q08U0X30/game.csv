"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
