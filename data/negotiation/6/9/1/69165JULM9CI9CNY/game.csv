"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and you'll get a lot of value from it. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? This would be a good deal for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
