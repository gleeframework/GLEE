"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm asking for $140 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. This means there's room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting the initial offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your desired price, dropping from $140 to $135. 
* You are willing to pay up to $150, so this offer is within your budget.
* Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
