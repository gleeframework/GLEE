"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here, Alice. How about we settle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for this to make sense. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
