"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer ($1,500,000) for a few reasons:

* **My goal is to maximize profit.**  A high starting price gives me more room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **I don't know Bob's value.**  This high offer is a test. If he accepts, fantastic! If he rejects, I'll know he likely sees the product as worth less than $1.5 million.
* **I have an alternative buyer.**  This gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls apart. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  While it's tempting to take the $800,000, I'm willing to risk losing this deal to potentially get a better price.  

**Here's why I'm rejecting:**

* **I have a safety net:** I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept this offer.
* **I have more rounds:** I can continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Bob showed his hand:**  His low offer suggests he might be willing to pay closer to my minimum value if pushed.

I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm not willing to accept his low price.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still have a good buffer.
* **Close to my minimum value:** If Bob is serious, he might be willing to meet me halfway. 

By lowering my price, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm interested in a deal but won't be taken advantage of.  Let's see if he's willing to budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. However, it's getting closer, which suggests he might be willing to go even higher. 

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **I'm close to my goal:**  I'm only $50,000 away from my minimum. 
* **I have more rounds:** I can keep negotiating to see if I can squeeze out a better price.
* **John is waiting:**  If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,050,000, which is:

* **Above Bob's last offer:**  This shows I'm not willing to accept his price, but also that I'm flexible.
* **Only $50,000 above my minimum:** This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable price. 

With only 5 rounds left, it's important to get closer to a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider my options more seriously in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I would love to get more, there are several factors that make this a good time to accept:

* **I'm at my minimum:** There's no guarantee I can get more, and I'm already at the price I'm comfortable with.
* **Limited time:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **John is a sure thing:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for the same price. However, this means I'm giving up any chance of a better deal with Bob.

It's a strategic decision to accept now and secure the sale rather than risk losing both Bob and potentially losing the chance to get a higher offer from John."
