"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's starting price is higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our target price and what John is offering. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but Alice is still slightly above John's price.  We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple: I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer, considering it's what the product is worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Direct Approach:**  We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. This offer is direct and lays out our reasoning (matching Alice's valuation).
* **Final Offer:**  By framing this as our best offer, we're signaling to Alice that we're prepared to walk away if she rejects it. This adds a bit of pressure for her to accept. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Alice rejects this offer, we can still take John's deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,200. We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **John's Offer:** John's standing offer of $12,000 is now a better deal than Alice's final price.
* **Time Limit:**  We are running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will change her mind. It's better to take John's offer now and secure the product."
