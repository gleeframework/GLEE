{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to make a significant counteroffer to show Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. Offering $105 is a good starting point, as it's still lower than your maximum budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate. It also shows that you're willing to meet her halfway."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price of $150. Even though we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, there's still time to try and get a better deal.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, so we need to be more aggressive. This offer is just above your target price, but it shows Alice you're willing to meet her halfway. This is a risky move, as Alice might reject it. However, it could also be the last chance to get a better price before buying from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. 

* **You're almost out of time:**  This is the second-to-last round.  If you reject this offer and Alice rejects your counteroffer, you'll have no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Alice's offer is close:** $140 is only $10 more than your desired price of $150.  
* **You have a chance to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John. 

While it's not ideal, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to get the product and avoid a worse outcome."
