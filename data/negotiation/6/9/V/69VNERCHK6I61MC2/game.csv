"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $120.  Let's try to find a compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I've got to make a profit, so I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
