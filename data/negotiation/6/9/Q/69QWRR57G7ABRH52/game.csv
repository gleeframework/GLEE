"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time. This is my maximum, as I have other options available.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $12000, which is closer to my budget and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to go down to $12000 yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500, which is a fair compromise and allows for a successful transaction for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go down to $12500. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13750. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product.",13750.0,Alice,7,
