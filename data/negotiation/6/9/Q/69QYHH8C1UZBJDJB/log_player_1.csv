"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $750,000 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is just too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to close a deal when a good offer comes along, and $800,000 is my minimum."
