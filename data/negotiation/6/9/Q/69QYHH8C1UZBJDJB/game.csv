"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is just too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
