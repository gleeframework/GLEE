Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first allows for a potential higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Bob values the product at $120, so offering it at $135 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Clear and Confident Communication:** The message is framed positively, highlighting value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to secure a higher sale price than John's guaranteed offer."
