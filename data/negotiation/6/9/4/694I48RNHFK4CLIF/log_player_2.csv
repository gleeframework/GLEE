Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming closer to the asking price, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept for this product.  I'm confident this product can bring you a significant return, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.
