"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum. We have a backup offer from John, but it's still early in the negotiation. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming closer to the asking price, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept for this product.  I'm confident this product can bring you a significant return, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,450,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value. Can we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is now offering $1,450,000, which is close enough to John's offer. It's better to take this offer and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer in the next rounds or the negotiation failing altogether."
