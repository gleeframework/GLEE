"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $78.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell the product to you for $81. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it brings. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
