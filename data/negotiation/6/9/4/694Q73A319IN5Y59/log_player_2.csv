Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this product will be worth far more than that to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
