Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,200,000 sets a high anchor point. While it's more than Bob initially values the product for, it's still significantly less than your guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation. Bob may try to haggle, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still making a substantial profit.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not explicitly mentioning John, you subtly create a sense of urgency. Bob might be more inclined to accept a good offer rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
