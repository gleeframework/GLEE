"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it has tremendous value for you, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a high price ($1,000,000) sets a strong baseline for the negotiation. It gives us room to negotiate down while still making a significant profit.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob,  which could encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Stating that we are willing to negotiate shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer, starting the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below our minimum:**  $750,000 is below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:**  We have 10 rounds, so we have room to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, we have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so there's no immediate need to settle for a price below our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** We've lowered our offer to $900,000, showing flexibility but still staying above our minimum.
* **Emphasize value and compromise:** The message reaffirms the product's value while explicitly mentioning a desire for compromise, encouraging Bob to see our offer as a step in the right direction.
* **Maintain negotiation leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, we maintain leverage and give ourselves more time to secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above our minimum:**  $850,000 is higher than our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **No need to risk further negotiations:** While we could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, there's no guarantee that further negotiations will be successful. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already in round 4, and every round reduces our leverage and increases the risk that negotiations will fall through.
* **Secure a profitable sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
