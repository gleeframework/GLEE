Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. My next offer is $1090000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have only 3 rounds left.  While you could continue to negotiate with Alice, it's getting riskier.  If you reject Alice's offer, there's no guarantee that she will come down any further, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. 

Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees you get the product.  While it's not your ideal price, it's the most secure option given the remaining rounds and Alice's reluctance to lower her offer significantly."
