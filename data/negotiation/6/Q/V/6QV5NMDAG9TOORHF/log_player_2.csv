"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate a better deal. There is a $300,000 gap between Alice's offer and what the product is worth to me. I should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price of $800,000, and I still get a significant discount compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. I'm comfortable accepting this offer and saving $350,000."
