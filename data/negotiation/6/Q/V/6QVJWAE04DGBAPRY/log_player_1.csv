Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $160 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $150.  It's time to finalize the sale!"
