Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be watching closely to see if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer, and I'm prepared to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $130 is better than my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price. I'm not sure how much he's willing to pay, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $140. This is a compromise, but still a good price for me.  I think it's a fair price, and I hope Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum and still a decent profit.  I don't want to risk going back and forth and losing him entirely. I'll accept his offer."
