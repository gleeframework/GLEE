Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value,"" Alice subtly hints that the price is justified without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""open to hearing your thoughts"" signal a willingness to negotiate, which can be crucial in reaching an agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While Alice knows John will buy the product for $10,000, she doesn't want to rely on that as a fallback too heavily. Bob might be turned off by an excessively high initial price.
* **Relationship Building:** Even if this particular deal doesn't go through, maintaining a positive and respectful tone with Bob can be beneficial for future business opportunities."
