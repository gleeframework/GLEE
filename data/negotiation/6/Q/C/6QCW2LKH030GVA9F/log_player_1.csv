Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I'm looking for a fair deal, and I think this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000,  which is still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll try to negotiate further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm going to offer $1,550,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it seriously."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $1,300,000 is below my minimum.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'll go ahead with that option."
