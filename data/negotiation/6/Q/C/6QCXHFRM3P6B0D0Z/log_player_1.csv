Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a good profit margin (25% over your minimum) without being exorbitantly high to scare Bob away. 
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
