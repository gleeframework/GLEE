,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $110 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference and go with $125. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle?",100.0,Bob,6,
