"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it's a fair deal for me as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $12,000. You can save $1,500 by going with John."
