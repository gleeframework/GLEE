Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $900000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the $1000000 you're willing to pay. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support package that will add significant value to the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
