"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great deal for you considering the $1000000 you're willing to pay. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $900000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the $1000000 you're willing to pay. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support package that will add significant value to the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
