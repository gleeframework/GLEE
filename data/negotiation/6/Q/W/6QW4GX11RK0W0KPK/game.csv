"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and provides you with a fair opportunity to acquire it. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
