Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but still leaves a significant profit margin for myself. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than the $1,000,000 I could get from John, so I'm aiming high to see if we can strike a deal at a good price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it still leaves me with a profit margin and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  While it's less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
