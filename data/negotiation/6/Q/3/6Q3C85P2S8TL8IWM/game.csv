"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This reflects a more accurate price point given its potential.",925000.0,Alice,3,
