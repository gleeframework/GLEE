"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",8000.0,Bob,6,
