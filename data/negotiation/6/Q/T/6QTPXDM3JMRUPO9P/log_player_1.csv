"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique features and value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $18,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $9,000. Accepting this offer means a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
