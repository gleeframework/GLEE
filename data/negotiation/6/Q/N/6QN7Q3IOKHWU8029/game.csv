"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1100000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1125000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1075000 or lower. Can we discuss a price that works for both of us?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
