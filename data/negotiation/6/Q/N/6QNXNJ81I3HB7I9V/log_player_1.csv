Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you could still settle on a price higher than John's offer ($10,000).
* **Confident Presentation:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still ensuring a sale."
