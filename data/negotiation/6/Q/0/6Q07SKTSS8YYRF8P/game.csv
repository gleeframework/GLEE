"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This price allows me to make a profit while still offering you a valuable product. Let's meet halfway here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can you consider $1,280,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can agree on this price.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,280,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. How about $1,320,000? This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can you consider $1,300,000? This is the highest I can go, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
