Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,150,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price given the value you've stated and the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $850,000, which is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures you get a fair deal and avoids the risk of prolonged, potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
