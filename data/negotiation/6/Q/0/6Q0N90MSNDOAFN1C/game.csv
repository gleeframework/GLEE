"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,150,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price given the value you've stated and the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
