Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might walk away or I might end up buying from John at $1,000,000.  $887,500 is a good deal for me, saving me a substantial amount. I'll accept this offer."
