"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you expressed interest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $100.  You're better off rejecting her offer and buying from John."
