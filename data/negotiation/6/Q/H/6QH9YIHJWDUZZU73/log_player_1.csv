"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good middle ground between my minimum value of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $150. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob and highlighting the value he'll get. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** $120 is a significant improvement over my minimum.
* **Encourage negotiation:** Leaving room for Bob to counter ensures continued negotiation and potential for a higher price. 
* **Maintain control:** I'm not giving away too much value initially, but also not being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident that I can secure a better price through continued negotiation.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a price higher than $100, but lower than my initial offer. I'll aim for a compromise that allows me to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference at $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $110 is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still attractive to Bob. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give up too much.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the mutual benefit of the proposed price. It's designed to keep the negotiation amicable and avoid escalating tensions.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $110 is a significant profit for me, considering my minimum of $80.
* **Keep Bob interested:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to be flexible, encouraging him to continue the negotiation. 
* **Maintain control:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but also not being overly demanding, making a deal more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is a good compromise that allows me to earn a decent profit while securing a deal with Bob.  There are only 6 rounds left and continuing to negotiate might lead to lower offers or rejection. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and avoid potential risks associated with further rounds."
