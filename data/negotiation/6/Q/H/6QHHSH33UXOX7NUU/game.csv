"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we try $155? It's a compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",155.0,Alice,5,
