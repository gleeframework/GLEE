"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than that. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on.  To be frank, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I think this product is a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers and make a counteroffer of $800,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
