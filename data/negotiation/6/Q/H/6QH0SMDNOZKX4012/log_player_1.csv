Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a rationale for the price by mentioning its value to Bob. This makes the offer appear more reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm clearly indicating that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This strategy allows for a negotiation process, but also ensures I can secure a good deal if Bob isn't willing to pay my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a good starting point.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is better than my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point and my initial offer.  I'm not going to accept this low offer right away. I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial price, but I'm still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that $850,000 is still a good deal for both of us, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Negotiation:** I'm inviting further negotiation by suggesting we find a compromise that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to get a fair deal here.  How about we split the difference closer to your last offer, say $800,000? That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more,  accepting his offer is the most sensible choice here:

* **Meeting My Minimum:** This offer guarantees I get my absolute minimum price, which is essential.
* **No Further Gains:**  There's a strong possibility that further negotiation won't yield a higher price, especially since Bob is already at my minimum.
* **Risk of Loss:**  Rejecting this offer and counter-offering could lead to Bob walking away or lowering his offer even further, leaving me with a lower price or the need to sell to John, which would result in the same price. 

By accepting this offer, I secure my minimum desired profit without risking a worse outcome."
