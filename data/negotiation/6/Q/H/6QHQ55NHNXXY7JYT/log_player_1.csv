Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This allows room for potential counter-offers and compromise.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $13,500, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob doesn't agree to that price, it makes it more likely he'll be willing to pay a higher amount than he might have initially considered.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest and encourage him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, which gives you a strong fallback position."
