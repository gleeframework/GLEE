Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information you provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain. This offer is valid for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor.  Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Urgency:** The limited-time offer encourages Bob to act quickly and reduces the chance of him stalling or seeking alternative options.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" reinforces the product's worth and justifies the high price.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing the price as a ""fair deal"" emphasizes mutual benefit, even though it heavily favors you.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If you have a long-standing relationship with Bob or value future interactions, you might adjust the price slightly lower to ensure a positive experience.
* **Bob's Personality:** Consider if Bob is known for hard bargaining. If so, you might need to start even higher to provide negotiation room."
