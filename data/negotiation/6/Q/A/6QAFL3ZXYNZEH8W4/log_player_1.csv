Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to exceed $800,000 for the product. Perhaps we could find a way to reach a mutual agreement closer to my budget?

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer. Continuing negotiations would likely be fruitless and waste valuable time. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option as it meets the minimum acceptable price."
