"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $980000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to meet my minimum requirement.
