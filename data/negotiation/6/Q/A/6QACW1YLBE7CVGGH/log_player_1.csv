Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is still too low for me. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings and it's still well below what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $900,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
